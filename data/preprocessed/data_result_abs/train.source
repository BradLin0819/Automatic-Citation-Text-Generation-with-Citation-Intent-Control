abstract the authors report four very rare radiation-associated tumors (or radiation-induced tumors; rits) of the central nervous system (cns) and review the literature on this topic. the purpose of this study was to determine the possible relationship between the harmful effects of radiation therapy, the shortest and the longest interval between the time of irradiation and the occurrence of the secondary tumor, and possible predisposing factors. the tumorigenic effects of therapeutic irradiation of the cns have been mentioned in the literature, but the authors’ literature search did not disclose either many reports of cases such as their own or a satisfactory and concise discussion on the different aspects of the late and catastrophic complications of this method of adjunct therapy to the cns. four rare cases of rit in three patients are presented: a unique case of intradural meningioma of the cervical spine, which was irradiated successfully only for the patient to present with a new high-grade cerebral astrocytoma 4 years later, a paraventricular cavernoma and a fronto-temporo-orbital chondrosarcoma. these second rits became symptomatic in the 17th, 16th and 15th years of life, respectively, in these young patients. the primary lesions were ependymomas, two in the iv ventricle and one in the left hemisphere. the time intervals between radiation and secondary tumor presentation were 14 and 18 years, 9 years and 28 months, in the order in which these patients presented. all the patients survived the second operation except the one with chondrosarcoma, who died in spite of repeated surgical interventions and adjunct therapies. it is concluded that the development of secondary rits does not necessarily require a very long time interval; that although sarcomas are the most common rits of the cns in childhood and adolescence, benign and other rare and curable lesions may also occur in the field or vicinity of the field of radiation; and that in view of the possibility of occurrence of different types of rits after varying time intervals in a single patient, whole-life follow-up of similar patients is mandatory. this is the second follow-up study of 2,215 persons who during childhood between 1940 and 1959 had been given x-ray therapy for tinea capitis and of 1,395 persons well matched for age, sex, and race who were treated for the same disease during the same period without the use of x-ray therapy. the major finding of the study was an excess incidence in the irradiated cases of tumors of the head and neck including the skin, brain, thyroid, and parotid. however, between the groups there was no difference in death due to malignant neoplasms or any other cause. among white patients, a 40% excess of treated psychiatric disorders was observed in the irradiated group, but there was no difference among blacks.
the present study determined the effect of clostridium perfringens isolates taken from necrotic enteritis (ne) outbreaks on organic farms in a ne virulence testing model. thirteen strains were isolated in the course of the study. six c. perfringens field isolates were taken from a naturally occurring ne outbreak on an organic farm. polymerase chain reaction toxinotyping was used to establish c. perfringens strains, as well as to create a toxin profile. all field isolates were found to be type a and positive for alpha, beta-2 and netb toxin genes. during the ne virulence model, digesta samples were collected before oral inoculation to define the c. perfringens found as part of the natural flora. three of the five natural flora isolates were found to be c. perfringens type e while the other two isolates were type a; only four of five isolates were positive for either netb or beta-2 toxin genes. two isolates collected after inoculation were c. perfringens type a positive for cpb2 and netb. all isolates were tested positive for the quorum-sensing-related gene luxs, regardless of the strain source. the presence of luxs, alpha, netb and beta-2 toxin genes seems not to be a determinant of the disease as they were present in isolates from both outbreak birds as well as healthy and pre-inoculated birds. the c. perfringens field isolates induced mild ne lesions in one-half of the birds during the challenge study. other mechanisms must play a role in the development of the disease beyond toxinotype, potentially including intestinal ecology and health, which would account for acute disease as seen in the field outbreak. abstract necrotic enteritis is an enteric disease of avian species caused by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium perfringens. the disease is regularly controlled in the broiler chicken industry with antimicrobials in feed but is reemerging in areas such as europe where there is a ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters. to study prospective therapies, researchers must be able to reproduce this disease in a controlled environment, but this is not always possible because of differences in the pathogenicity of c. perfringens strains. our objective was to test the potential of five isolates (snecp43, 44, 47, 49, and 50), taken from field cases of necrotic enteritis, at recreating the disease in a controlled challenge experiment. snecp43 and 50 were derived from a common clone, with snecp50 passed in vivo and snecp43 subcultured in vitro. four hundred birds were divided into 16 pens, with three pens each receiving one of five treatments, with one control pen. day-old birds were raised on a high wheat-based diet to promote necrotic enteritis development and were challenged with between 3.4 × 109 and 3.2 × 1011 colony-forming units (cfu) of c. perfringens in feed for a period of 24 hr starting on day 13 of the challenge experiment. lesion scores were assessed on two birds per pen sacrificed on day 17 and on any dead birds during the 25-day study. growth performance was assessed up to 25 days, and mortality recorded throughout. only snecp50 produced necrotic enteritis mortalities significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from the control. the five isolates were also typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to assess their genetic relatedness. all epidemiologically unrelated isolates were deemed genetically unrelated, whereas snecp43 and 50 differed by only a single minor band. toxin type was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr), which was also used for the detection of the gene encoding the β2-toxin.
abstract the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of patients with visual concerns that interfere with their activities of daily living (adl) performance in physical rehabilitation units through occupational therapy assessment. over the two-month study period, 215 adult inpatients from a physical rehabilitation hospital were evaluated using the brief vision screen (bvs) through adl. the bvs assessed four areas of visual concerns, namely left visual field, focusing, and near- and low-contrast acuity, while patients engaged in adl. the occupational therapists identified 33% of patients who had at least one area of visual concern, with the largest proportion diagnosed with stroke (55%), followed by pulmonary disease (40%) and joint replacement (35%). when comparing the four areas of visual concerns in the bvs between the two major diagnostic groups (acquired brain injury, abi and non-acquired brain injury, non-abi), a significantly higher proportion of patients with abi were identified as having left hemianopsia concerns compared to patients with non-abi. no significant difference was observed in other areas of visual concern between the two groups. findings indicated that visual concerns that interfere with adl performance among older patients in rehabilitation units are common. the high proportion of patients with pulmonary disease identified as having visual concerns warranted further confirmation and investigation. preliminary evidence to support the psychometric properties of the bvs for identifying visual concerns in patients on rehabilitation units was established. in a prospective study, we assessed the prevalence and significance of visual and hearing impairment in 896 patients who were hospitalized for rehabilitation following hip fracture. visual impairment was defined as visual acuity equal to worse than 6/60 in the better of the two eyes. hearing impairment was defined as mean decibel level equal to or higher than 60 in the better of the two ears. visual impairment was found in 210 patients (23.4%) and hearing impairment was found in 231 patients (25.8%). simultaneous visual and hearing impairment was seen in 72 patients (8%). in univariate analysis, the absolute efficacy of rehabilitation was significantly lower in patients with visual impairment compared to those without (p = 0.00001) and in patients with hearing impairment compared to those without (p = 0.002). however, in multivariate analysis, visual, but not hearing, impairment was found to be independently associated with the absolute efficacy of rehabilitation (p = 0.001). in light of these results, we propose that in the first phase of rehabilitation, patients' visual acuity needs to be optimized.
chronic wounds afford a hostile environment of damaged tissues that allow bacterial proliferation and further wound colonization. escherichia coli is among the most common colonizers of infected wounds and it is a prolific biofilm former. living in biofilm communities, cells are protected, become more difficult to control and eradicate, and less susceptible to antibiotic therapy. this work presents insights into the proceedings triggering e. coli biofilm control with phage, honey, and their combination, achieved through standard antimicrobial activity assays, zeta potential and flow cytometry studies and further visual insights sought by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. two portuguese honeys (pf2 and u3) with different floral origin and an e. coli-specific phage (ec3a), possessing depolymerase activity, were tested against 24- and 48-h-old biofilms. synergic and additive effects were perceived in some phage–honey experiments. combined therapy prompted similar phenomena in biofilm cells, visualized by electron microscopy, as the individual treatments. honey caused minor membrane perturbations to complete collapse and consequent discharge of cytoplasmic content, and phage completely destroyed cells leaving only vesicle-like structures and debris. our experiments show that the addition of phage to low honey concentrations is advantageous, and that even fourfold diluted honey combined with phage, presents no loss of antibacterial activity toward e. coli. portuguese honeys possess excellent antibiofilm activity and may be potential alternative therapeutic agents in biofilm-related wound infection. furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first study that assessed the impacts of phage–honey combinations in bacterial cells. the synergistic effect obtained was shown to be promising, since the antiviral effect of honey limits the emergence of phage resistant phenotypes. the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa ubiquitously inhabits soil and water habitats and also causes serious, often antibiotic resistant, infections in immunocompromised patients (e.g. cystic fibrosis). this versatility is mediated in part by a large repertoire of two-component regulatory systems that appear instrumental in the regulation of both virulence processes and resistance to antimicrobials. major two-component regulatory system proteins demonstrated to regulate these diverse processes include phop–phoq, gaca–gacs, rets, lads, and algr, among others. here, we summarize the current body of knowledge of these and other two-component systems that provides insight into the complex regulation of virulence and resistance in p. aeruginosa.
the recent trend in orthodontic treatment is to apply esthetic materials to orthodontic appliances with adequate clinical performance. the aim of this study was to investigate the ultrastructure (surface roughness) and mechanical properties (load-deflection curve) of three as-received, white-coated superelastic nickel-titanium (niti) archwires using atomic force microscopy (afm) and modified three-point bending test assessments, respectively. three representative esthetic niti archwires were used, silver-platinum- and polymer-coated niti natural dany (dany group), epoxy resin-coated orthoforce ultraesthetic™ (ultra group), and teflon®-coated perfect (perfect group). uncoated metallic areas of each wire were used as controls. the diameter of the perfect archwire was significantly larger than that of other archwires. the dany and ultra groups showed more deflection than the perfect group. the hysteresis area of the dany and ultra groups showed approximately two- and fourfold increases compared to the control and the perfect group. the dany group (2037.5 ± 527.3 nm) had the highest peak-to-peak surface roughness in the coated areas, followed by the ultra group (811.1 ± 407.5 nm) and the perfect group (362.7 ± 195.8 nm). however, reverse nanostructural changes in the surface roughness were observed in the uncoated metallic areas. the results suggested that the load-deflection properties and the surface roughness of superelastic niti archwires were affected directly by the coating materials. although the efficiency of orthodontic treatment was affected by various factors, when only considering the frictional force and mechanostructural properties, the epoxy resin-coated orthoforce ultraesthetic™ archwires were the most effective for orthodontic treatment. previous mechanical testing of orthodontic wires has, in many cases, failed to simulate some key features of the clinical environment. the purpose of this study was to investigate the load-deflection characteristics of 7 different 0.016-in initial alignment archwires (twistflex, niti, and 5 brands of heat-activated superelastic nickel-titanium [hasn]) with modified bending tests simulating a number of conditions encountered clinically. load-deflection tests were carried out on the wires with 5 different model designs, and data from selected points on the unloading phase of the generated graphs were statistically analyzed. wire deflection was carried out at 3 temperatures (22.0 degrees c, 35.5 degrees c, and 44.0 degrees c) and to 4 deflection distances (1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm). rankings were derived according to statistically significant differences in each test situation. the effects of model, wire, and temperature variation were all statistically significant. twistflex and the 5 hasn wires produced a range of broadly comparable results, and niti gave the highest unloading values. model rankings indicated that self-ligating twin-lock brackets produced lower friction than regular edgewise brackets. the authors recommend using the rankings from the mechanical test simulations to predict possible clinical performance of archwires.
the purpose of this project was to assess the degree to which a patient, after 1 wk of experience, could adapt to 3.2-mm and 6.8-mm basal shifts in the representation of speech. only small deficits in performance were found after practice after the 3.2-mm shift. after practice after the 6.9-mm shift, scores on tests that emphasized amplitude envelope cues returned to baseline levels. scores on vowel and sentence tests that emphasized frequency-based cues remained poor. scores for “place,” however, showed some recovery. vowel recognition may be the limiting factor in recognizing basally shifted speech. the goal of the present study was to investigate the time course of adaptation by experienced cochlear implant users to a shifted frequency-to-electrode assignment in their speech processors. speech recognition performance of three nucleus-22 cochlear implant users was measured over a 3-month period, during which the implant listeners continuously wore "experimental" speech processors that were purposely shifted by 2-4 mm in terms of the frequency-to-electrode assignment relative to their normal processor. baseline speech performance was measured with each subject's clinically assigned speech processor just prior to implementation of the experimental processor. baseline speech performance was measured again after the 3-month test period, immediately following the reinstallation of the clinically assigned processor settings. speech performance with the experimental processor was measured four times during the first week, and weekly thereafter over the 3-month period. results showed that the experimental processor produced significantly lower performance on all measures of speech recognition immediately following implementation. over the 3-month test period, consonant and hint sentence recognition with the experimental processors gradually approached a performance level comparable to but still significantly below the baseline and postexperiment measures made with the clinically assigned processor. however, vowel and timit sentence recognition with the experimental processors remained far below the level of the baseline measures even at the end of the 3-month experimental period. there was no significant change in performance with the clinically assigned processor before or after fitting with the experimental processor. the results suggest that a long-time exposure to a new pattern of stimulation may not be able to compensate for the deficit in performance caused by a 2-4-mm shift in the tonotopic location of stimulation, at least within a 3-month period.
drosophila down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (dscam) can be variably spliced to encode 152,064 distinct single-pass transmembrane proteins. in addition to 19,008 possible ectodomains and two alternative transmembrane segments, it may carry endodomains containing or lacking exons 19 and 23. here, we determine the role of dscam endodomain diversity in neural development. dscam with full-length endodomain is largely restricted to embryogenesis. in contrast, most dscams lack exons 19 and 23 at postembryonic stages. as implicated from the expression patterns, removal of dscam exon 19-containing variants disrupts wiring of embryonic neurons while silencing of dscam transcripts lacking exon 19 or exon 23 effectively blocks postembryonic neuronal morphogenesis. furthermore, compared with exon 19-containing dscam, transgenic dscam without exon 19 is more efficiently targeted to neurites and more potently suppresses axon bifurcation in dscam mutant neurons. in sum, dscam with or without exon 19 in its endodomain is used to govern different stage-specific neuronal morphogenetic processes, possibly due to differences in protein targeting. besides 19,008 possible ectodomains, drosophila dscam contains two alternative transmembrane/juxtamembrane segments, respectively, derived from exon 17.1 and exon 17.2. we wondered whether specific dscam isoforms mediate formation and segregation of axonal branches in the drosophila mushroom bodies (mbs). removal of various subsets of the 12 exon 4s does not affect mb neuronal morphogenesis, while expression of a dscam transgene only partially rescues dscam mutant phenotypes. interestingly, differential rescuing effects are observed between two dscam transgenes that each possesses one of the two possible exon 17s. axon bifurcation/segregation abnormalities are better rescued by the exon 17.2-containing transgene, but coexpression of both transgenes is required for rescuing mutant viability. meanwhile, exon 17.1 targets ectopically expressed dscam-gfp to dendrites while dscam[exon 17.2]-gfp is enriched in axons; only dscam[exon 17.2] affects mb axons. these results suggest that exon 17.1 is minimally involved in axonal morphogenesis and that morphogenesis of mb axons probably involves multiple distinct exon 17.2-containing dscam isoforms.
we investigated the clinical significance of tumour-infiltrating foxp3-positive regulatory t cells (tregs) in radically resected (r0) gastric cancer. from a single-institution database, tumors of 110 patients who underwent r0 resection for stage ii-iii disease were studied for foxp3-positive tregs by immunohistochemistry. the observed median number of foxp3-positive tregs was used as the cut-point in analyses (<6 versus >or=6 count). tregs were significantly higher in gastric carcinomas than in normal tissue (p = 0.0001). tregs count >or=6 was significantly associated with vascular/lymphatic/perineural invasion (velipi) in the tumour (p = 0.03). multivariate analysis showed association between adverse relapse-free survival and grading 3, stage iii, velipi and tregs count >or=6 (p = 0.02). adverse overall survival was associated with grading 3, stage iii, velipi and tregs count >or=6 (p = 0.006). foxp3-positive tregs may be a novel marker for identifying high-risk gastric cancer patients. present findings deserve additional investigation as tregs may also represent an innovative therapeutic target. regulatory t cells (tregs) are thought to affect the severity of various infectious and autoimmune diseases. the incidence of autoimmune disease is higher in fertile women than in men. thus, we investigated whether treg numbers were modulated during the menstrual cycle by sex hormones. in fertile nonpregnant women, we detected an expansion of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. this increase was tightly correlated with serum levels of estradiol and was followed by a dramatic decrease in treg numbers at the luteal phase. women who have had recurrent spontaneous abortions (rsa) showed similarly low numbers of tregs at both the follicular and luteal phases, comparable to numbers we observed in postmenopausal women. in addition to decreased numbers, tregs from women with rsa were also functionally deficient, as higher numbers were required to exert a similar magnitude of suppression to cd4+cd25+foxp3+ cells from fertile women. consequently, reproductive failure might result from the inability of tregs in women with rsa to expand during the preimplantatory phase combined with their lower functional capacity. additionally, the modulation of treg numbers we observed in fertile women suggests that the stage of the menstrual cycle should be taken into account when treg numbers are investigated clinically.
background the aims of this study were to determine hyposalivation, xerostomia, and oral health status of hiv-subjects in thailand before highly active antiretroviral therapy era.   methods oral examination and measurement of saliva flow rate of both unstimulated and wax-stimulated whole saliva were performed in 135 subjects (56 hiv-subjects, mean age: 34.5 years, and 79 non-hiv controls, mean age: 29.5 years). presence of oral candidiasis, cervical root caries, and number of existing teeth were recorded. microbiological investigation of oral candida was conducted using oral rinse technique. risk factors associated with hyposalivation and xerostomia were analysed.   results the unstimulated flow rates in hiv-subjects and non-hiv controls were 0.19 and 0.33 ml/min (p = 0.0024). for stimulated flow rates, the corresponding figures were 1.45 and 1.62 ml/min (p = 0.31). the unstimulated flow rate was significantly higher in the asymptomatic hiv-subjects: 0.17 ml/min, when compared with the symptomatic/aids group 0.11 ml/min (p = 0.003). no significant difference between the groups could be found with respect to stimulated flow rate. hyposalivation was significantly associated with the colony forming unit of candida. smoking and alcohol consumption were significantly associated with hyposalivation, but not xerostomia. the following factors were significantly associated with both hyposalivation and xerostomia; sex, stage of hiv infection, risk group of hiv infection, systemic disease, and medication use.   conclusions salivary flow rate of hiv-subjects in thailand was affected by hiv infection. the rate was significantly decreased with advanced stage of the disease. various factors including medication use were associated with hyposalivation and xerostomia among the subjects. this investigation compared the salivary anticandidal activities of 12 healthy adults with 12 hospitalized patients with aids. stimulated parotid, submandibular-sublingual, and whole salivas were collected during a period of 10 min, immediately acidified, boiled, and then centrifuged to isolate salivary supernatants. supernatants were then tested for antifungal activity against candida albicans in blastospore viability inhibition and germ tube formation assays. a unit of blastospore or germ tube antifungal activity was established as that activity yielding 90% or greater inhibition during a defined time period in each salivary assay. each of the patients with aids were found to be defective in one or more of their salivary antifungal activities, and in comparison with healthy adults the differences in antifungal units per milliliter of saliva and total antifungal units were statistically significant for each saliva and each antifungal assay. defective salivary antifungal activity may contribute to the oral candidiasis seen in patients with aids.
olfactory system second-order neurons, mitral-tufted cells, have odorant receptive fields (orfs) (molecular receptive ranges in odorant space for carbon chain length in organic odorant molecules). this study quantified several dimensions of these excitatory odorant receptive fields to novel odorants in rats and then examined the effects of passive odorant exposure on the shape of the orf-tuning curve. orfs for carbon chain length of novel ethyl esters (pure odorants that the animals had not been exposed to previously) were determined before and after a 50 sec prolonged exposure to one of the odorants. in response to novel odorants, quantitative analysis of mitral-tufted cell excitatory orfs revealed that the median orf width spanned 3-4 carbons, generally with a single-most excitatory odorant. exposure to either the most excitatory odorant (on-peak) or an odorant that was two carbons longer (off-peak) for 50 sec produced whole orf suppression immediately after the end of the prolonged exposure, with the on-peak exposure producing the greatest suppression. these results are consistent with a feature-detecting function for mitral-tufted cells. redetermination of the orf 15 and 60 min after the exposure revealed that off-peak exposure produced a reduction in responsiveness to the best odorant and an increase in responsiveness to the exposed odorant. in contrast, exposure to the on-peak odorant or no odorant did not affect orfs. given that mitral-tufted cells receive exclusive excitatory input from olfactory receptor neurons expressing identical receptor proteins, it is hypothesized that experience-induced mitral-tufted cell orf changes reflect modulation of lateral and centrifugal olfactory bulb circuits. 1. recordings of extracellular spike responses were made from single mitral/tufted cells in the main olfactory bulb of urethan-anesthetized rabbits. olfactory epithelium ipsilateral to the recorded olfactory bulb was stimulated with homologous series of aliphatic compounds using periodic artificial inhalations. 2. in the dorsomedial part of the main olfactory bulb, single mitral/tufted cells were activated by subsets of n-fatty acids with similar hydrocarbon chain lengths. response selectivities of single mitral/tufted cells were examined in detail using a series of n-fatty acids at five different concentrations. the results indicate that although the range of effective fatty acids is broader at the higher concentrations, the best response at higher concentrations was similar to that determined at lower concentrations. 3. analysis of single-unit responses to the panel of fatty acids, including those with branched hydrocarbon chains, suggested that the determinants for the response specificities of individual mitral/tufted cells in the dorsomedial region include the overall size of hydrocarbon chains of the odor ligand molecules. 4. single mitral/tufted cells in the dorsomedial region tended to be activated not only by fatty acids but also by n-aliphatic aldehydes. for a panel of a homologous series of n-aldehydes at five different concentrations, individual mitral/tufted cells showed response selectivity to subsets of aldehydes with similar hydrocarbon chain lengths. 5. in most cases, normal aliphatic alcohols and alkanes were ineffective in activating mitral/tufted cells in the dorsomedial region. this suggests that carbonyl group (--c = o) in the odor molecules plays an important role in determining response specificity of these neurons. 6. examination with an expanded panel of stimulus odor molecules that included ketones and esters indicated that single mitral/tufted cells sensitive to subsets of fatty acids and n-aliphatic aldehydes were also responsive to subsets of ketones and/or esters having hydrocarbon chain lengths similar to those of the effective fatty acids and aldehydes. 7. the present results show a clear correlation between the tuning specificity of individual mitral/tufted cells and the stereochemical structure of the odor molecules, with respect to 1) length and/or structure of hydrocarbon chain, 2) difference in functional group, and 3) position of the functional group within the molecule. 8. a hypothetical diagram suggesting functional convergence of olfactory nerve input to individual glomeruli is proposed to explain the mechanism for selective activation of individual mitral/tufted cells by a range of odor molecules with similar stereochemical structures.
background and aimscolorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer death in european countries and differences in screening implementation may in part explain usa vs european survival differences. despite the evidence, no study has evaluated the population colorectal cancer screening (ccs) coverage in any european country. we aimed to index the current ccs practices among a large sample of greek healthy adults.materials and methodsthe study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. screening practice habits of 5,259 healthy adults, aged 50–80, were surveyed. both overall and screening practices of stool occult blood test (sobt), digital rectal examination (dre), and colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy (col/sig) were analyzed.resultsof the population analyzed, 90.1% declared that they were interested in cancer prevention activities. overall sobt practice rate within the last 2 years was 4.77%. when only screening procedures were analyzed, this percentage shrank to 1.73%. overall and screening col/sig rates within the last 10 years were 8.76 and 1.74%, respectively. the respective proportions of individuals who underwent dre were 14.54 and 5.2%. evidence-based screening practices were influenced by age, family history of colorectal cancer, profession, and educational level; however, sobt and colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy did not overcome 4.1 and 4.6% in any subpopulation analyzed.conclusionthe level of ccs coverage among the examined sample of greek adults was discouraging. surveys among other european countries are encouraged. background several international guidelines have recommended the involvement of general practitioners (gps) in screening programs, but current evidence suggests this is very difficult. we implemented a survey to understand the attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding colorectal cancer screening of gps in the lazio region.   methods survey of all gps working in 13 of the 50 districts in lazio using a mail-in questionnaire.   results out of 1192 gps, 699 responded (59%). ninety-four percent consider crc a preventable disease. knowledge about oncological screenings is higher in gps using the guidelines as source of information. twenty-five percent properly recommend the available screening tests for colorectal cancer, 22% do not recommend any, 6% under-recommend, and 47% over-recommend. adequate knowledge of oncological screenings is positively associated with correct recommendation. thirty-two percent of gps recommend inappropriate follow-up tests for patients with positive fecal occult blood test.   conclusions the low response rate reveals the lack of gp's interest in screening. knowledge about screening and use of guidelines as sources of scientific information are important factors to improve attitudes about screening, but there is a large percentage of well-informed gps who do not recommend colorectal cancer screening at all. currently, many gps do not properly follow the patients up after a positive fobt.
rhesus glycoprotein homologs rhag, rhbg, and rhcg comprise a recently identified branch of the mep/amt ammonia transporter family. animal studies have shown that rhbg and rhcg are present in the kidney distal tubules. studies in mouse and rat tissue suggest a basolateral localization for rhbg in cells of the distal tubules including the α-intercalated cells (α-ic), but no localization of rhbg has been reported in human tissue. to date rhcg localization has been described as exclusively apical plasma membrane in mouse and rat kidney, or apical and basolateral in humans, and some mouse and rat tissue studies. we raised novel antibodies to rhbg and rhcg to examine their localization in the human kidney. madin-darby canine kidney (mdcki) cell lines stably expressing human green fluorescent protein-tagged rhbg or rhcg and human tissue lysates were used to demonstrate the specificity of these antibodies for detecting rhbg and rhcg. using immunoperoxidase staining and antigen liberation techniques, both apical and basolateral rhcg localization was observed in the majority of the cells of the distal convoluted tubule and ic of the connecting tubule and collecting duct. confocal microscopic imaging of normal human kidney cryosections showed that rhcg staining was predominantly localized to the apical membrane in these cells with some basolateral and intracellular staining evident. a proportion of rhcg staining labeled kae1-positive cells, confirming that rhcg is localized to the α-ic cells. surprisingly, no rhbg protein was detectable in the human kidney by western blot analysis of tissue lysates, or by immunohistochemistry or confocal microscopy of tissue sections. the same antibodies, however, could detect rhbg in rat tissue. we conclude that under normal conditions, rhcg is the major putative ammonia transporter expressed in the human kidney and rhbg is not expressed at detectable levels. mineralocorticoid hormones regulate salt transport along the distal nephron by binding to intracellular receptors and activating gene transcription. previous experiments showed that systemic aldosterone infusions stimulate thiazide-sensitive na and cl transport by distal convoluted tubule (dct) cells; this effect could have been direct or secondary to systemic hormonal effects. aldosterone target tissues express both mineralocorticoid receptors and the metabolic enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. mineralocorticoid receptors have been localized to the dct in some experiments, but not in others. expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 by dct cells has not been investigated. the present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that rat dct cells are targets of aldosterone action. patterns of mineralocorticoid receptor, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, thiazide-sensitive na-cl cotransporter, and na/ca exchanger expression along the distal tubule were examined. a polyclonal antibody was generated to localize the thiazide-sensitive na-cl cotransporter. thiazide-sensitive na-cl cotransporter and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression were examined using both in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry; na/ca exchanger and mineralocorticoid receptor expression were examined by immunocytochemistry. the results indicate that 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is expressed by dct cells, as well as connecting tubule cells and principal cells of the collecting duct; expression levels are low near the junction with the thick ascending limb and rise near the transition to the connecting tubule. mineralocorticoid receptors are expressed by dct cells, as well as along the thick ascending limb, connecting tubule, and collecting duct. the results indicate that components of the mineralocorticoid receptor system are expressed by dct cells, suggesting that these cells are targets of aldosterone action.
postoperative sore throat and hoarseness are common and disturbing complications following endotracheal intubation, and women are more frequently affected by these symptoms. this study explores risk factors associated with postoperative sore throat and hoarseness in women following intubation. in this prospective cross-sectional study, 97 patients undergoing elective ear, nose, and throat surgery or plastic surgery were included. eight different variables were analyzed to detect possible associations for the development of postoperative sore throat or hoarseness. for data analysis, the chi2 test and the odds ratio were used. three variables were found to be significant risk factors for postoperative sore throat: age greater than 60 years (p = .01), the use of a throat pack (p = .04), and endotracheal tube no. 7.0 (size 7 mm; p = .02). the only risk factor found to be significantly associated with developing hoarseness was an endotracheal cuff pressure below 20 centimeters of water (p = .04). larger studies are needed to confirm these risk factors. background diffusion of nitrous oxide into the cuff of the endotracheal tube results in an increase in cuff pressure. excessive endotracheal tube cuff pressure may impair tracheal mucosal perfusion and cause tracheal damage and sore throat. filling the cuff of the endotracheal tube with saline instead of air prevents the increase in cuff pressure due to nitrous oxide diffusion. this method was used to test whether tracheal morbidity is related to excess in tracheal cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia. methods fifty patients with american society of anesthesiologists physical status i or ii were randomly allocated to two groups with endotracheal tube cuffs initially inflated to 20–30 cm h2o with either air (group a) or saline (group s). anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. at the time of extubation, a fiberoptic examination of the trachea was performed by an independent observer, and abnormalities of tracheal mucosa at the level of the cuff contact area were scored. patients assessed their symptoms (sore throat, dysphagia, and hoarseness) at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit and 24 h after extubation on a 101-point numerical rating scale. results cuff pressure increased gradually during anesthesia in group a but remained stable in group s. the incidence of sore throat was greater in group a than in group s in the postanesthesia care unit (76 vs. 20%) and 24 h after extubation (42 vs. 12%;p < 0.05). tracheal lesions at time of extubation were seen in all patients of group a and in eight patients (32%) of group s (p < 0.05). conclusion excess in endotracheal tube cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia due to nitrous oxide diffusion into this closed gas space causes sore throat that is related to tracheal mucosal erosion.
background: commission of crime and hostility and their forensic consequences in a patient with schizophrenia can worsen the patient's condition and disturb his family, society, and even the psychiatrist. based on previous research, patients with schizophrenia are at a higher risk for crime. it is not clear whether this is due to the nature of schizophrenia, comorbidity of antisocial personality disorder, or the history of conduct disorder in childhood. in this study, we investigated this hypothesis. materials and methods: in this case-control study, 30 criminal and 30 non-criminal patients with schizophrenia, who had been referred by the court to the forensic medicine center of isfahan, were evaluated for antisocial personality disorder, history of conduct disorder, and psychopathy checklist-revise (pcl-r) score. results: frequency distribution of antisocial personality disorder (73.3%), history of conduct disorder in childhood (86.7%), and score of pcl-r ≥25 (indicating high probability of hostility) in patients (40%) were significantly higher in criminal patients than in non-criminals (10%, 30% and 0%, respectively; p < 0.001). conclusions: more prevalence of antisocial personality disorder, history of conduct disorder, and high score of pcl-r (≥25) in criminal schizophrenic patients may indicate that in order to control the hostility and for prevention of crime, besides treating acute symptoms of psychosis, patients might receive treatment and rehabilitation for comorbidities too. more than 15 years ago, findings from the epidemiological catchment area study indicated that antisocial personality disorder (apd) is more prevalent among persons with schizophrenia than in the general population. the present study analyzed data from a multisite investigation to examine the correlates of apd among 232 men with schizophrenic disorders, three-quarters of whom had committed at least one crime. comparisons of the men with and without apd revealed no differences in the course or symptomatology of schizophrenia. by contrast, multivariate models confirmed strong associations of comorbid apd with substance abuse, attention/concentration problems, and poor academic performance in childhood; and in adulthood with alcohol abuse or dependence and deficient affective experience (a personality style indexed by lack of remorse or guilt, shallow affect, lack of empathy, and failure to accept responsibility for one's own actions). at first admission, men with schizophrenia and apd presented a long history of antisocial behavior that included nonviolent offending and substance misuse, and an emotional dysfunction that is thought to increase the risk of violence toward others. specific treatments and management strategies are indicated.
abstract artemisone is one of the most promising artemisinin derivatives in clinical trials. previous studies with radiolabeled artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin have measured uptake in plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. uptake is much greater in infected than in uninfected erythrocytes, but the relative contributions of transport, binding, and metabolism to this process still await definition. in this study, we characterized mechanisms by which [14c]artemisone is taken up into uninfected and p. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes in vitro. radiolabeled artemisone rapidly enters uninfected erythrocytes without much exceeding extracellular concentrations. unlabeled artemisone does not compete in this process. radiolabeled artemisone is concentrated greatly by a time- and temperature-dependent mechanism in infected erythrocytes. this uptake is abrogated by unlabeled artemisone. in addition, the uptake of artemisone into three subcellular fractions, and its distribution into these fractions, is examined as a function of parasite maturation. these data are relevant to an understanding of the mechanisms of action of this important class of drugs. there is great need to identify and characterize drug targets and chemotherapeutic strategies against malaria. here we show that a vacuolar-network induced by the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, is a major import pathway for artemisinin, a leading, new anti-malarial that is known to be effective against drug resistant strains. we also show that artemisinin-treatment induces aberrant, budding of a vacuolar-network membrane protein and its antimalarial activity is additive with toxic sphingolipid analogues that block the network. the data suggest that artemisinin alters membrane protein export from the vacuolar-network and combinations with anti-network reagents have the potential to provide powerful new chemotherapy for drug resistant malaria.
abstract. transient expression of wild-type human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) in hek293t cells resulted in a profound decrease in the amplitude of volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying cl– channel (vsor) current without changing the single-channel amplitude. this effect was not mimicked by expression of the δf508 mutant of cftr, which did not reach the plasma membrane. the vsor regulation by cftr was not affected by g551d mutation at first nucleotide-binding domain (nbd1), which is known to impair cftr interaction with the outwardly rectifying chloride channel, orcc, epithelial amiloride-sensitive na-channel, enac, and renal potassium channel, romk2. the cftr-vsor interaction was insensitive to the deletion mutation, δtrl, which is known to impair cftr-pdz domain binding. in contrast, the g1349d mutant, which impairs atp binding at nbd2, effectively abolished the down-regulatory effect of cftr. furthermore, the k1250m mutation at the walker a motif and the d1370n mutation at the walker b motif, both known to impair atp hydrolysis at nbd2, completely abolished the vsor regulation by cftr. thus, we conclude that an atp-hydrolysable conformation of nbd2 is essential for the regulation of the vsor by the cftr protein, and that vsor is a first channel regulated by cftr through its nbd2. 1 to investigate whether the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) interacts with volume regulated anion channels (vracs), we measured the volume‐activated chloride current (icl,swell) using the whole‐cell patch‐clamp technique in calf pulmonary artery endothelial (cpae) cells and in cos cells transiently transfected with wild‐type (wt) cftr and the deletion mutant δf508 cftr. 2 i cl,swell was significantly reduced in cpae cells expressing wt cftr to 66.5 ± 8.8% (n= 13; mean ±s.e.m.) of the control value (n= 11). this reduction was independent of activation of the cftr channel. 3 expression of δf508 cftr resulted in two groups of cpae cells. in the first group ibmx and forskolin could activate a cl− current. in these cells icl,swell was reduced to 52.7 ± 18.8% (n= 5) of the control value (n= 21). in the second group ibmx and forskolin could not activate a current. the amplitude of icl,swell in these cells was not significantly different from the control value (112.4 ± 13.7%, n= 11; 21 control cells). 4 using the same method we showed that expression of wt cftr in cos cells reduced icl,swell to 62.1 ± 11.9% (n= 14) of the control value (n= 12) without any changes in the kinetics of the current. non‐stationary noise analysis suggested that there is no significant difference in the single channel conductance of vrac between cftr expressing and non‐expressing cos cells. 5 we conclude that expression of wt cftr down‐regulates icl,swell in cpae and cos cells, suggesting an interaction between cftr and vrac independent of activation of cftr.
the organization and localization of lexico-semantic information in the brain has been debated for many years. specifically, lesion and imaging studies have attempted to map the brain areas representing living versus nonliving objects, however, results remain variable. this may be due, in part, to the fact that the univariate statistical mapping analyses used to detect these brain areas are typically insensitive to subtle, but widespread, effects. decoding techniques, on the other hand, allow for a powerful multivariate analysis of multichannel neural data. in this study, we utilize machine-learning algorithms to first demonstrate that semantic category, as well as individual words, can be decoded from eeg and meg recordings of subjects performing a language task. mean accuracies of 76% (chance=50%) and 83% (chance=20%) were obtained for the decoding of living vs. nonliving category or individual words respectively. furthermore, we utilize this decoding analysis to demonstrate that the representations of words and semantic category are highly distributed both spatially and temporally. in particular, bilateral anterior temporal, bilateral inferior frontal, and left inferior temporal-occipital sensors are most important for discrimination. successful intersubject and intermodality decoding shows that semantic representations between stimulus modalities and individuals are reasonably consistent. these results suggest that both word and category-specific information are present in extracranially recorded neural activity and that these representations may be more distributed, both spatially and temporally, than previous studies suggest. in a sentence reading task, words that occurred out of context were associated with specific types of event-related brain potentials. words that were physically aberrant (larger than normal) elecited a late positive series of potentials, whereas semantically inappropriate words elicited a late negative wave (n400). the n400 wave may be an electrophysiological sign of the "reprocessing" of semantically anomalous information.
background previous cross-sectional studies have suggested that biomarkers of extracellular matrix remodelling are associated with atrial fibrillation (af), but no prospective data have yet been published. hence, we examine whether plasma matrix metalloproteinases (mmp) and their inhibitors are related to increased risk of incident af. methods we used a case-cohort design in the context of the prospective atherosclerosis risk in communities (aric) study. from 13718 eligible men and women free from af in 1990-92, we selected a stratified random sample of 500 individuals without and 580 with incident af over a mean follow-up of 11.8 years. using a weighted proportional hazards regression model, the relationships between mmp-1, mmp-2, mmp-9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (timp)-1, timp-2 and c-terminal propeptide of collagen type-i with incident af were examined after adjusting for confounders. results in models adjusted for age, sex and race, all biomarkers were associated with af, but only the relationship between plasma mmp-9 remained significant in the fully-adjusted model: each one standard deviation increase in mmp-9 was associated with 27% (95% confidence interval: 7% to 50%) increase in risk of af with no evidence of an interaction with race or sex. individuals with above mean levels of mmp-9 were more likely to be male, white and current smokers. conclusions the findings suggest that elevated levels of mmp-9 are independently associated with increased risk of af. however, given the lack of specificity of mmp-9 to atrial tissue, it remains to be determined whether the observed relationship reflects the impact of atrial fibrosis or more generalized fibrosis on risk of incident af. objective—to evaluate if biomarkers reflecting left ventricular/vascular extracellular matrix remodeling are associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd) and death in the community. methods and results—in 922 framingham study participants (mean age, 58 years; 56% women), we related circulating concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (binary variable: detectable versus undetectable), log of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and log of procollagen type iii aminoterminal peptide (piiinp) to incident cvd and death. on follow-up (mean, 9.9 years), 51 deaths and 81 cvd events occurred. each sd increment of log of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and log-piiinp was associated with multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios of 1.72 (95% ci, 1.30 to 2.27) and 1.47 (95% ci, 1.11 to 1.96), respectively, for mortality risk. log-piiinp concentrations were also associated with cvd risk (hazard ratio [95% ci] per sd, 1.35 [1.05 to 1.74]). death and cvd incidence rates were 2-fold higher in participants with both biomarkers higher than the median (corresponding hazard ratio [95% ci], 2.78 [1.43 to 5.40] and 1.77 [1.04 to 3.03], respectively) compared with those with either or both less than the median. the inclusion of both biomarkers improved the c-statistic (for predicting mortality) from 0.78 to 0.82 (p=0.03). matrix metalloproteinase-9 was unrelated to either outcome. conclusion—higher circulating tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and piiinp concentrations are associated with mortality, and higher piiinp is associated with incident cvd, in the community.
leading theories of false memory predict that veridical and false recall of lists of semantically associated words can be dissociated by varying the presentation speed during study. specifically, as presentation rate increases from milliseconds to seconds, veridical recall is predicted to increase monotonically while false recall is predicted to show a rapid rise and then a slow decrease—a pattern shown by mcdermott and watson (2001) in a study using immediate recall tests. in three experiments we tested the generality of the effects of rapid presentation rates on veridical and false memory. in experiments 1 and 2 participants exhibited high levels of false recall on a delayed recall test, even for very fast stimulus onset asynchronies (soa)—contrary to predictions from leading theories of false memory. when we switched to an immediate recall test in experiment 3 we replicated the pattern predicted by the theories and observed by mcdermott and watson. follow-up analyses further showed that the relative output position of false recalls is not affected by presentation rate, contrary to predictions from fuzzy trace theory. implications for theories of false memory, including activation monitoring theory and fuzzy trace theory, are discussed. two experiments examined false recall for lists of semantically and phonologically associated words as a function of presentation duration. veridical recall increased with long exposure durations for all lists. for semantically associated lists, false recall increased from 20-250 ms, then decreased. there was a high level of false recall with 20 ms durations for phonologically associated lists (47 and 44% for experiments 1 and 2, respectively), which declined as duration increased. in experiment 2, for lists presented at 20 and 50 ms rates, false recall given zero correct recall was observed frequently, suggesting that conscious recollection of studied words was not necessary for phonological false memory. differences between phonologically and semantically associated lists were consistent with a feature integration model based on automatic initial processing of phonetic features of words.
donkeys, an endangered species, have recently gained a new application with the use of their milk to feed humans with allergic processes. the ragusana donkey breed from sicily is used to produce milk for humans with allergic diseases. in order to evaluate the hygienic, nutritional and management measures on a farm of ragusana donkeys, complete blood counts, extended biochemical profiles and serum protein electrophoresis, as part of metabolic profile test (mpt), were performed in ragusana donkeys. fifty-four donkeys were studied and grouped according to their age, (1) 29 females and a single stallion (n=30), (2) young females, 1 – 3 years old (n=10) and (3) young of both sexes under 1 year old (n=14). the rbc count, rdw value, lymp, and mono counts, and pdw values were statistically greater in donkeys under one year old than in adult donkeys, while the seg neu count was lower. the cpk, alp, iphos, and hco3, values were statistically higher in the group of donkeys under 1 year of age than adult donkeys while cl and ldh values were statistically lower in donkeys under 1  year than adult donkeys. additionally, statistically significant increased values for cpk, alp, alb, chol, iphos, hco3, and uibc in young donkeys under 1 year when compared with young donkeys, 1 – 3 years were observed. a statistically significant decreased value for urea and an increased value for crea in young donkeys, 1 – 3 years old were found as compared to adults. the serum protein fractions recognised by electrophoresis were: albumin, alpha globulin (subdivided into alpha-1 and alpha-2-globulins), beta globulin, and gamma globulin. in the alpha-1-globulin region three small peaks were constantly noticed, and alpha-2-globulins were statistically different between the three groups being greater in young donkeys under 1 year of age. the results obtained were used both to establish reference ranges and a data bank for the farm of ragusana donkeys for future needs in assessing the metabolic status and health of the animals. most successful books undergo an evolutionary change incorporating new information and increasing in size with each edition. clinical biochemistry is no exception. the ¢rst edition was a small format book, published in 1963, with 9 contributors which dealt, in 13 chapters and 678 pages, with the subject of clinical biochemistry. this latest edition is a large format book (28622 cm) running to 30 chapters and 932 pages. some chapters have been amalgamated (lipids and ketones), while four new chapters have been added since the fourth edition and now tumour markers, toxicology, lysosomal storage diseases and avian biochemistry are included. the list of eminent contributors has also increased from 30 to 35, including the editors. the well tried format of this book is retained with each chapter covering a de¢ned area. in 1963, the ¢rst two chapters covered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. in the latest edition, the ¢rst four chapters cover concepts of normality, dna technology, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. however, despite these similarities between the ¢rst and ¢fth editions, the content of each chapter is radically altered. originally biochemistry was the principle topic, with much emphasis on formuli and biochemical pathways and less on disease and the use of biochemistry in diagnosis. in the latest edition, biochemistry and physiology are inextricably mixed and, in the majority of chapters, considerable emphasis is placed on diagnosis using biochemical based methods as well as other methods, such as muscle biopsy or scintigraphy. there is also an updating of information, although the time taken for a book of this size and complexity actually to reach the market place means that the references are not completely up to date; 1996 is the last date i saw and, in some of the original chapters, there are still signi¢cant numbers of references relating to work completed in the 1960s and 1970s. these comments may make readers who already possess the 4th edition wonder whether there have been su¤cient changes to make the purchase of the latest edition worthwhile. in my opinion purchase of the 5th edition would be bene¢cial. the new chapters cover areas not previously dealt with and extend to almost 900 pages. those chapters where amalgamation has occurred have been extensively rewritten and all the chapters covered in the fourth edition have been updated. in some there have also been major modi¢cations, especially when the author has changed, for example, in the chapter on hepatic function, previously written by charles e. cornelius and now covered by bud c. tennant, or the chapter on vitamins (formerly newberne and conner, now rucker and morris). the ¢fth edition is a well presented hardback book with clear text and very good diagrams, many of which present even very complex data in an easy to understand fashion. each chapter, like those in the fourth edition, is divided into clearly labelled veterinary research communications, 22 (1998) 293^294 # 1998 kluwer academic publishers. printed in the netherlands
purposeautosomal recessive hyper-ige syndrome is a rare combined immunodeficiency characterized by susceptibility to viral infections, atopic eczema, high serum ige and defective t cell activation. the genetic etiologies are diverse. null mutations in dock8 and tyk2 are responsible for many cases. this study aims to provide a detailed clinical and immunological characterization of the disease and explore the underlying genetic defects among a large series of patients followed by a single center. the available data might improve our understanding of the disease pathogenesis and prognosis.methodsclinical data of twenty-five patients diagnosed with ar-hies were collected. seventeen patients screened for stat3, tyk2 and dock8 mutations.resultssinopulmonary infections, dermatitis, hepatic disorders, cutaneous and systemic bacterial, fungal and viral infections were the most common clinical features. the rate of hepatic disorders and systemic infections were high. twelve patients died with a median age of 10 years. cmv infection was the only statistically significant predicting factor for poor prognosis (early death). three novel dock8 mutations and two large deletions were found in thirteen patients. no mutations found in stat3 or tyk2 genes.conclusionautosomal recessive hyper-ige syndrome is a combined immunodeficiency disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality rate. the different genetic background and environmental factors may explain the more severe phenotypes seen in our series. dock8 defect is the most common identified genetic cause. patients with no identified genetic etiology are likely to carry mutations in the regulatory elements of genes tested or in novel genes that are yet to be discovered. background the genetic etiologies of the hyper-ige syndromes are diverse. approximately 60% to 70% of patients with hyper-ige syndrome have dominant mutations in stat3, and a single patient was reported to have a homozygous tyk2 mutation. in the remaining patients with hyper-ige syndrome, the genetic etiology has not yet been identified.   objectives we aimed to identify a gene that is mutated or deleted in autosomal recessive hyper-ige syndrome.   methods we performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis for 9 patients with autosomal-recessive hyper-ige syndrome to locate copy number variations and homozygous haplotypes. homozygosity mapping was performed with 12 patients from 7 additional families. the candidate gene was analyzed by genomic and cdna sequencing to identify causative alleles in a total of 27 patients with autosomal-recessive hyper-ige syndrome.   results subtelomeric biallelic microdeletions were identified in 5 patients at the terminus of chromosome 9p. in all 5 patients, the deleted interval involved dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (dock8), encoding a protein implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. sequencing of patients without large deletions revealed 16 patients from 9 unrelated families with distinct homozygous mutations in dock8 causing premature termination, frameshift, splice site disruption, and single exon deletions and microdeletions. dock8 deficiency was associated with impaired activation of cd4+ and cd8+t cells.   conclusion autosomal-recessive mutations in dock8 are responsible for many, although not all, cases of autosomal-recessive hyper-ige syndrome. dock8 disruption is associated with a phenotype of severe cellular immunodeficiency characterized by susceptibility to viral infections, atopic eczema, defective t-cell activation and t(h)17 cell differentiation, and impaired eosinophil homeostasis and dysregulation of ige.
in the past few years, the incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis (hvl) has increased in many districts of fars province, southwest of iran, particularly, among communities of nomadic tribes. recent epidemiological reports in leishmania infantum endemic regions of iran indicate that more than 50–70% of seropositive dogs are asymptomatic for leishmania infection. between 2004 and 2006, blood samples were collected from 110 domestic dogs from nomadic and rural areas. each of these samples was tested for anti-leishmania antibodies, in direct agglutination tests (dats), and for l. infantum kinetoplast deoxyribonucleic acid (kdna), in polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assays. of the 110 dogs, 5.5% (6/110) were found seropositive and 23% (25/110) pcr-positive. four of the six seropositive (67%) and 22 of the 25 pcr-positive (88%) were asymptomatic. the rate of infection in dogs from nomadic communities was higher (27%) than dogs from rural areas (18%). since positivity in the pcr-based assay indicated the presence of l. infantum amastigotes in the peripheral blood of 23% of the subjects, it is clear that these asymptomatic dogs (88%) are quite common in the study areas and probably act as reservoirs in the transmission of leishmania parasites, to humans and to other dogs, by sandflies. moreover, our study showed that application of pcr to buffy coat samples gave a better estimate of the real rate of infection in asymptomatic dogs than dat. an epidemiological study to examine the sero-prevalence of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis (zvl) among domestic and wild canines in endemic foci of iran was carried out during 1999-2003 to assess the distribution of the disease and the possible association between infection in dogs, wild canines and people. anti-leishmanial antibodies were detected by the direct agglutination test (dat). parasitological study was performed for all captured wild canines and were detected in some of the seropositive dogs with specific clinical signs (n=107). serum samples (n=1568) were collected from domestic dogs in villages that are known endemic foci of human visceral leishmaniosis (hvl). wild canine sera were collected from jackals (canis aureus, n=10), foxes (vulpes vulpes, n=10) and wolves (canis lupus, n=10). of the 1568 serum sampled collected from domestic dogs, 222 (14.2%) were positive by dat (1:320 and above). no statistically significant difference was found between male (15.2%) and female (11.8%) sero-prevalence (p=0.083). dogs of 8 years and above showed the highest sero-prevalence (40.6%). only 23.9% of the seropositive domestic dogs had clinical signs. parasitology and serology tests that were performed in 30 wild canines showed 10% these animals were infected by leishmania infantum. ten out of 11 leishmania spp. isolated from the dogs and wild canines were identified as l. infantum and one other as l. tropica by molecular and biochemical techniques. for the first time in iran, l. infantum and l. tropica were isolated from viscera of both a wolf and a domestic dog.
the growing commercial demand for products with medicinal use has caused overexploitation of several plant species worldwide. to prevent the decline of these populations, the collection of these resources should be done in a sustainable way considering the time of its replacement in natural stocks. this study was designed to identify the relationship between different intensities of extraction of bark from the trunk of stryphnodendron rotundifolium mart. and its regeneration speed. for this, we selected two areas of cerrado in the northeast of brazil, where a monitoring experiment with duration of 24 months was performed. this experiment consisted in simulating different extractive damage to assess the regeneration of bark. in each area, we selected 20 individuals, among which four treatments with five repetitions were implemented. the data showed that in both study areas, the trees regenerated their shells faster when subjected to higher collection intensities. however, this regeneration was not related to variations in rainfall in the environment. due to the current exploitation and consequent extinction of native medicinal plants around the world, new strategies have been proposed to address the sustainable use of this resource. accordingly, the goal of this study is to assess the speed of bark regeneration of myracrodruon urundeuva allemão and to compare the tannin content before and after tissue regeneration. twenty individuals from an area of caatinga in caruaru, pernambuco state (ne brazil), were selected. to evaluate the speed of bark regeneration, four treatments were established, according to the area of bark removed (10 × 2, 6 × 5, 8 × 5 and 10 × 5 cm), with five replicates (five individuals of m. urundeuva allemão) and three treatments of tannin content (bark removed before damage, as regenerated tissue, and non-impacted bark or control). at the end of 23 months of monitoring the regeneration, we found that only seven of the 20 individuals analyzed did not fully heal. no significant correlation between the monthly percent regeneration and average monthly precipitation was found. the tannin content varied according to the quantified tissue (after damage, regenerated and control) as well as between damage classes (20 cm2—41.64 to 63.53 mg; 30 cm2—49.25 to 67.54 mg; 40 cm2—31.69 to 67.44 mg; 50 cm2—34.08 to 48.53 mg). despite the variations found, there was no significant difference between the measurement periods (p > 0.05) or damage classes (p > 0.05). the results showed that the regeneration rate was higher in individuals belonging to the 10 × 2 and 10 × 5 cm groups and that there is no correlation between precipitation and regeneration speed. tannin levels did not vary significantly in the tissues before damage and after regeneration.
we tested the hypothesis that increased production of nitric oxide (no*) by inducible no* synthase (inos) is a key factor responsible for alterations in the expression, localization, and function of key tight junction (tj) proteins in mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (lps, endotoxin). endotoxemia was associated with hepatobiliary epithelial barrier dysfunction, as evidenced by increased plasma-to-bile leakage of fitc-labeled dextran (relative molecular mass 40 kda) and increased circulating levels of bile acids and conjugated bilirubin. immunoblotting revealed decreased expression of zonula occludens (zo)-1, zo-2, zo-3, and occludin in liver after injection of c57bl/6j mice with 2 mg/kg escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps. nonidet p-40-insoluble (i.e., tj-associated) occludin and zo-1 were virtually undetectable 12 and 18 h after injecting lps. immunofluorescence microscopy also revealed deranged subcellular localization of zo-1 and occludin in endotoxemic mice. pharmacological inhibition of inos activity using l-n6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (5 mg/kg) or genetic ablation of inos ameliorated lps-induced changes in hepatobiliary barrier function, and these strategies partially preserved tj protein expression and localization. steady-state levels of occludin and zo-3 transcripts decreased transiently after injecting lps but returned toward normal by 12 and 24 h after induction of endotoxemia, respectively. these results support the view that inos-dependent no* production is an important factor contributing to hepatobiliary epithelial barrier dysfunction resulting from systemic inflammation and suggest that inos induction may play a role in the development of cholestatic jaundice in patients with severe sepsis. hyperbilirubinemia is frequently associated with endotoxemia. regurgitation of bile constituents including bilirubin into the sinusoidal space is prevented by tight junctions which maintain paracellular permeability between hepatocytes. to investigate the mechanism of endotoxin-associated hyperbilirubinemia, we have studied the changes in paracellular permeability of primary hepatocyte couplets treated with endotoxin. in addition, we examined the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (udca), which has been widely used for various liver diseases, on endotoxin-associated changes in paracellular permeability. the paracellular permeability of hepatocyte couplets was evaluated by paracellular penetration of fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-dextran with molecular weights of 3, 10 and 70k using confocal laser scanning microscopy. endotoxin increased the paracellular penetration of fitc-dextran 3 and 10k. these changes were prevented by treatment with udca. there was little paracellular penetration of fitc-dextran 70k under any conditions. these results suggested that endotoxin increased the paracellular permeability of hepatocyte couplets and these changes were prevented by treatment with udca. furthermore, bile regurgitation through the paracellular route is involved in endotoxin-associated hyperbilirubinemia, and udca might be a potential therapeutic agent for endotoxin-associated hyperbilirubinemia.
postoperative sore throat and hoarseness are common and disturbing complications following endotracheal intubation, and women are more frequently affected by these symptoms. this study explores risk factors associated with postoperative sore throat and hoarseness in women following intubation. in this prospective cross-sectional study, 97 patients undergoing elective ear, nose, and throat surgery or plastic surgery were included. eight different variables were analyzed to detect possible associations for the development of postoperative sore throat or hoarseness. for data analysis, the chi2 test and the odds ratio were used. three variables were found to be significant risk factors for postoperative sore throat: age greater than 60 years (p = .01), the use of a throat pack (p = .04), and endotracheal tube no. 7.0 (size 7 mm; p = .02). the only risk factor found to be significantly associated with developing hoarseness was an endotracheal cuff pressure below 20 centimeters of water (p = .04). larger studies are needed to confirm these risk factors. background diffusion of nitrous oxide into the cuff of the endotracheal tube results in an increase in cuff pressure. excessive endotracheal tube cuff pressure may impair tracheal mucosal perfusion and cause tracheal damage and sore throat. filling the cuff of the endotracheal tube with saline instead of air prevents the increase in cuff pressure due to nitrous oxide diffusion. this method was used to test whether tracheal morbidity is related to excess in tracheal cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia. methods fifty patients with american society of anesthesiologists physical status i or ii were randomly allocated to two groups with endotracheal tube cuffs initially inflated to 20–30 cm h2o with either air (group a) or saline (group s). anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. at the time of extubation, a fiberoptic examination of the trachea was performed by an independent observer, and abnormalities of tracheal mucosa at the level of the cuff contact area were scored. patients assessed their symptoms (sore throat, dysphagia, and hoarseness) at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit and 24 h after extubation on a 101-point numerical rating scale. results cuff pressure increased gradually during anesthesia in group a but remained stable in group s. the incidence of sore throat was greater in group a than in group s in the postanesthesia care unit (76 vs. 20%) and 24 h after extubation (42 vs. 12%;p < 0.05). tracheal lesions at time of extubation were seen in all patients of group a and in eight patients (32%) of group s (p < 0.05). conclusion excess in endotracheal tube cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia due to nitrous oxide diffusion into this closed gas space causes sore throat that is related to tracheal mucosal erosion.
background and aimslitter decomposition is a critical process in terrestrial ecosystems and understanding the effects of soil fertility on the litter decay rate is of great ecological relevance. here we test the hypothesis that n transfer from soil to litter will promote the decay rate of n poor but not n rich litter types.methodsten organic substrates, encompassing a wide range of biochemical quality in terms of c/n and lignin/n ratios, were decomposed in microcosms over three soil types with different n content, but inoculated with the same microbiome. organic substrates were characterized for mass loss, c and n content to assess n transfer from soil to litter.resultsthe decay rate response to soil fertility was related to their initial n content: positive for substrates with little initial n content and not significant for n rich plant residues. a significant n transfer, generally larger from n rich soil to n poor substrates, was found. litter c/n and lignin/n ratios showed variable relationships with the litter decay according with the soil fertility gradient, with positive and negative correlations in n rich and n poor soils, respectively.conclusionsour study demonstrated that the decomposition of n rich litter proceeded irrespective of soil fertility while the decay rate of n poor substrates, either lignin poor or rich, was controlled by soil fertility likely as a result of n transfer. litter c/n and lignin/n ratios were reliable indicators of litter quality to predict their decay rate in n poor soil, but not in n rich soils. litter decomposition provides the primary source of mineral nitrogen (n) for biological activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. a 10-year decomposition experiment in 21 sites from seven biomes found that net n release from leaf litter is dominantly driven by the initial tissue n concentration and mass remaining regardless of climate, edaphic conditions, or biota. arid grasslands exposed to high ultraviolet radiation were an exception, where net n release was insensitive to initial n. roots released n linearly with decomposition and exhibited little net n immobilization. we suggest that fundamental constraints on decomposer physiologies lead to predictable global-scale patterns in net n release during decomposition.
rationalenovelty and sensation seeking (nss) predisposes humans and rats to experiment with psychostimulants. in animal models, different tests of nss predict different phases of drug dependence. ultrasonic vocalizations (usvs) are evoked by psychomotor stimulants and measure the affective/motivation response to stimuli, yet the role nss has on usvs in response to amphetamine is not determined.objectivesthe aim of the present study was to determine if individual differences in nss and usvs can predict locomotor and usv response to amphetamine (0.0, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) after acute and chronic exposure.methodsthirty male rats were tested for their response to novelty (ien), choice to engage in novelty (npp), and heterospecific play (h-usv). rats were administered non-contingent amphetamine or saline for seven exposures, and usvs and locomotor activity were measured. after a 14-day rest, rats were administered a challenge dose of amphetamine.resultsregression analyses indicated that amphetamine dose-dependently increased locomotor activity and the npp test negatively predicted treatment-induced locomotor activity. the h-usv test predicted treatment-induced frequency-modulated (fm) usvs, but the strength of prediction depended on ien response.conclusionsresults provide evidence that locomotor activity and fm usvs induced by amphetamine represent different behavioral responses. the prediction of amphetamine-induced fm usvs by the h-usv screen was changed by the novelty response, indicating that the affective value of amphetamine—measured by fm usvs—depends on novelty response. this provides evidence that higher novelty responders may develop a tolerance faster and may escalate intake faster. behavioral sensitization and tolerance to repetitive exposure to addictive drugs are commonly used for the assessment of the early stages of the drug dependence progress in animals. the orchestra of tools for studying the progress of drug dependence in laboratory rodents has been considerably enriched in the 1980s by the introduction of ultrasonic vocalization (usv) detection and characterization. however, the relationship between the results of this technology and those of traditional behavioral tests is not clear. we attempted to elucidate some of the respective ambiguities by comparing the effects of an intermittent amphetamine treatment, which was aimed both at the induction of sensitization and tolerance to this drug and at testing the persistence of these effects, on the locomotor activity and 50-khz usv responses to both the drug and the context of drug exposure in adult male rats showing diverging susceptibility for sensitization to amphetamine. categorization of the rats into low and high responders/callers based on sensitization of their frequency-modulated 50-khz usv responsiveness showed some correspondence with conditioned place preference effects, but not with responses to amphetamine. the study showed distinct changes in the rate and latency of the frequency-modulated 50-khz usv responses to repetitive amphetamine treatment, which were reminiscent of classical behavioral signs of sensitization and tolerance. these results show the utility of the appetitive usv for monitoring of early phases of complex processes leading to drug dependence. however, usv, locomotor activity and conditioned place preference seem to reflect different aspects of these phenomena.
rett syndrome is an autism‐spectrum disorder caused by loss of function mutations within the gene encoding methyl cpg‐binding protein 2 (mecp2). while subtle decreases in synaptic plasticity have been detected within cortical and hippocampal neurons of mecp2‐null mice, only minimal information exists regarding how the loss of mecp2 affects network activity in the brain. to address this issue, we compared the intrinsic network activities of mecp2‐null hippocampal slices derived from symptomatic mice to wild‐type slices. extracellular and whole‐cell patch recordings revealed that although spontaneous, ipsp‐based rhythmic activity is present in mecp2‐null slices; its frequency is significantly reduced from wild‐type. this reduction was not associated with alterations in the gross electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons, but was associated with a decreased level of spontaneous glutamate receptor‐mediated synaptic currents in hippocampal ca3 neurons. paradoxically, however, repetitive sharp wave‐like discharges were readily induced in the mecp2‐null hippocampal slices by a brief train of high‐frequency stimulation commonly used to establish long‐term potentiation at wild‐type slices. taken together, our data indicate that the mecp2‐null hippocampal ca3 circuit has diminished basal inhibitory rhythmic activity, which in turn renders the circuitry prone to hyperexcitability. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc. during slow wave sleep and consummatory behaviors, electroencephalographic recordings from the rodent hippocampus reveal large amplitude potentials called sharp waves. the sharp waves originate from the ca3 circuitry and their generation is correlated with coherent discharges of ca3 pyramidal neurons and dependent on activities mediated by ampa glutamate receptors. to model sharp waves in a relatively large hippocampal circuitry in vitro, we developed thick (1 mm) mouse hippocampal slices by separating the dentate gyrus from the ca2/ca1 areas while keeping the functional dentate gyrus-ca3-ca1 connections. we found that large amplitude (0.3-3 mv) sharp wave-like field potentials occurred spontaneously in the thick slices without extra ionic or pharmacological manipulation and they resemble closely electroencephalographic sharp waves with respect to waveform, regional initiation, pharmacological manipulations, and intracellular correlates. through measuring tissue o2, k+, and synaptic and single cell activities, we verified that the sharp wave-like potentials are not a consequence of anoxia, nonspecific elevation of extracellular k+ and dissection-related tissue damage. our data suggest that a subtle but crucial increase in the ca3 glutamatergic activity effectively recruits a population of neurons thus responsible for the generation of the sharp wave-like spontaneous field potentials in isolated hippocampal circuitry.
backgroundevaluating postoperative femoral neck facture (fnf) with metal fixation hardware is commonly performed using radiographs. mri has greater sensitivity and specificity to evaluate osteonecrosis (on) but is often challenging due to the image distortion caused by metallic hardware.questions/purposesthe aim of this study is to compare fast spin-echo (fse) and multi-acquisition variable-resonance image combination (mavric) sequences in assessing on following metallic fixation of fnf and determining feasibility of semi-quantitative perfusion using mavric.methodsradiography and mri were performed at 3 and 12 months postoperatively, using fse and pre- and post-gadolinium contrast mavric sequences in 21 fnf patients. the presence and volume of on were recorded. signal intensity (si) enhancement was measured on the mavric sequences within the center and rim of on; with the ilium and femoral diaphysis as controls. the detection rate of on between mavric and fse images was evaluated as the difference of percent enhancement across the defined regions of interest.resultson was detected in 0% of radiographs, in 67% of fse, and in 76% of mavric images at 3 months follow-up, with similar results at 12 months. mavric images had larger on volume than fse images at both time points. a significant percentage si enhancement was only detected in the on rim.conclusionradiographs could not detect on following metallic fixation of fnf. mavric is more sensitive than fse for determining the volume of on. si measurements using mavric may provide an indirect assessment of perfusion. between 1980 and 1989 71 patients with a femoral neck fracture were treated at the university hospital of basel by a dynamic hip screw (n = 54) or by three compression screws (n = 17). fifty out of 71 patients (70%) were reviewed clinically and radiologically after an average of 116 months. 32/50 fractures (64%) had united. in 18/50 (36%) either avascular necrosis (12) or secondary fracture dislocation (6) had resulted in failure after an average of 29 months following injury. despite these results, the patients assessment had been very good or good in 44 patients (88%) and fair only in six patients (12%). the cause of secondary dislocation proved to be mainly due to a technical failure at surgery. the incidence of avascular necrosis was significantly higher in displaced fractures compared to non-displaced fractures (p < 0.05), regardless of the quality of the reduction achieved (varus or valgus) or the time delay between accident and operation. however it was interesting to note, that more than one third of all avascular necrosis became apparent more than 3 years (4-10 years) after the accident.
herpesvirus subfamilies typically acquire their final envelope in various cytoplasmic compartments such as the trans-golgi network (tgn), and endosomes prior to their secretion into the extracellular space. however, the sites for the final envelopment of epstein–barr virus (ebv), a ubiquitous human gamma herpesvirus, are poorly understood. here, we characterized the sites for the final envelopment of ebv in burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines induced into the lytic cycle by crosslinking cell surface igg. electron microscopy revealed the various stages of maturation and egress of progeny virions including mature ebv in irregular cytoplasmic vesicles. immunofluorescence staining showed that gp350/220, the major ebv glycoprotein, and the viral capsid antigen, p18, efficiently colocalized with a cis-golgi marker, gm130. gp350/220 partly colocalized with the tgn, which was distributed in a fragmented and dispersed pattern in the cells induced into the lytic cycle. in contrast, limited colocalization was observed between gp350/220 and endosomal markers, such as a multi-vesicular bodies marker, cd63, a recycling endosome marker, rab11, and a regulatory secretion vesicles marker, rab27a. finally, we observed that treatment of cells with brefeldin a, an inhibitor of vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus, resulted in the perinuclear accumulation of gp350/220 and inhibition of its distribution to the plasma membrane. brefeldin a also inhibited the release of infectious ebv. taken together, our findings support a model in which ebv acquires its final envelope in intracellular compartments containing markers of golgi apparatus, providing new insights into how ebv matures. enveloped viruses acquire their host‐derived membrane at a variety of intracellular locations. herpesviruses are complex entities that undergo several budding and fusion events during an infection. all members of this large family are believed to share a similar life cycle. however, they seemingly differ in terms of acquisition of their mature envelope. herpes simplex virus is often believed to bud into an existing intracellular compartment, while the related cytomegalovirus may acquire its final envelope from a novel virus‐induced assembly compartment. this review focuses on recent advances in the characterization of cellular compartment(s) potentially contributing to herpes virion final envelopment. it also examines the common points between seemingly distinct envelopment pathways and highlights the dynamic nature of intracellular compartments in the context of herpesvirus infections.
background h-1 parvovirus (h-1 pv), a rodent autonomous oncolytic parvovirus, has emerged as a novel class of promising anticancer agents, because of its ability to selectively find and destroy malignant cells. however, to probe h-1 pv multimodal antitumor potential one of the major prerequisites is to decipher h-1 pv direct interplay with human immune system, and so prevent any risk of impairment. methodology/principal findings non activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) are not sensitive to h-1 pv cytotoxic effect. however, the virus impairs both activated pbmc proliferation ability and viability. this effect is related to h-1 pv infection as evidenced by western blotting detection of h-1 pv main protein ns1. however, tcid50 experiments did not allow newly generated virions to be detected. moreover, flow cytometry has shown that h-1 pv preferentially targets b lymphocytes. despite seeming harmful at first sight, h-1 pv seems to affect very few nk cells and cd8+ t lymphocytes and, above all, clearly does not affect human neutrophils and one of the major cd4+ t lymphocyte subpopulation. very interestingly, flow cytometry analysis and elisa assays proved that it even activates human cd4+ t cells by increasing activation marker expression (cd69 and cd30) and both effective th1 and th2 cytokine secretion (il-2, ifn-γ and il-4). in addition, h-1 pv action does not come with any sign of immunosuppressive side effect. finally, we have shown the efficiency of h-1 pv on xenotransplanted human nasopharyngeal carcinoma, in a scid mouse model reconstituted with human pbmc. conclusions/significance our results show for the first time that a wild-type oncolytic virus impairs some immune cell subpopulations while directly activating a helper cd4+ t cell response. thus, our data open numerous gripping perspectives of investigation and strongly argue for the use of h-1 pv as an anticancer treatment. treatment of cancers by means of viruses, that specifically replicate in (oncotropism) and kill (oncolysis) neoplastic cells, is increasingly gaining acceptance in the clinic. among these agents, parvoviruses have been shown to possess not only direct oncolytic but also immunomodulating properties, serving as an adjuvant to prime the immune system to react against infected tumors. here, we aimed to establish whether immunomodulating mechanisms participate in the recently reported therapeutic potential of parvoviruses against pancreatic carcinoma. using adoptive transfer experiments we discovered that the transfer of splenocytes of donor rats harboring h-1pv-treated orthotopic pdac tumors could significantly prolong the survival of naïve tumor-bearing recipients, compared to those receiving cells from mock-treated donors. closer investigation of immunological parameters in infected donor rats revealed that virus-induced interferon gamma production and cellular immune response played an important role in this effect. these data have also preclinical relevance since abortive h-1pv infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or cocultivation of these cells with h-1pv-preinfected pancreatic cancer cells, resulted in enhancement of innate and adaptive immune reactivity. taken together our data reveal that oncolytic h-1pv modulates the immune system into an anticancer state, and further support the concept of using parvoviruses in the fight against pancreatic cancer.
urinalysis (i.e. laboratory test of urine) provides information about patient’s health conditions based on the contents present in a urine sample. a key factor to guarantee the quality of the test, it is arranging urinary findings in a clinical context. aiming to support the task, it was proposed an ontological model for urinary profiles (i.e. recurrent characteristics of urine that help in contextualizing it). besides providing context, it allows predicting which contents should be observed in a sample based on what was already found in it. although useful, such model defines urinary profiles as strictly related to the contents of the urine, when, in fact, it seems to be based on a broader context, including intrinsic properties of urine (e.g. ph) and things outside it (e.g. the patient from which the sample was collected). thus, this paper proposes an extension to such model including other aspects of the urinary context. it is defined using the unified foundational ontology (ufo). in this thesis, we aim at contributing to the theory of conceptual modeling and ontology representation. our main objective here is to provide ontological foundations for the most fundamental concepts in conceptual modeling. these foundations comprise a number of ontological theories, which are built on established work on philosophical ontology, cognitive psychology, philosophy of language and linguistics. together these theories amount to a system of categories and formal relations known as a foundational ontology
among the population over the age of 65 years joint diseases constitute more than 50% of chronic diseases and most often apply to the hip. endoprosthetics is one of the methods for treating this condition and is considered one of the best--clinically and economically--interventions of the modern medicine. however, it is not free of complications among which the loosening of the endoprosthesis is commonest. in publications, a full discussion has been going on arguing whether the complication is caused by biological or mechanical factors. the authors--aiming to answer this question based on ct--tested the influence of the implantation of the acetabular component on the pelvic bone density in hounsfield units within a 6-month period after the operation. the test results indicate the bone density decrease. the statistical analysis shows, however, that the changes are not statistically significant. thirty-four hips in which there had been prosthetic replacement were selected for study because of the presence of linear (diffuse) or lytic (localized) areas of periprosthetic bone loss. in all hips, there was careful documentation of the anatomical location of the material that had been obtained for histological analysis, and the specific purpose of the removal of the tissue was for examination to determine the cause of the resorption of bone. specimens from twenty-three hips were retrieved during an operation and from eleven hips, at autopsy. the area of bone loss was linear only in sixteen hips, lytic only in thirteen, and both linear and lytic in five. in all thirty-four hips, intracellular particulate debris was found in the macrophages that were present in the area of bone resorption. all thirty-four had intracellular particles of polyethylene, many of which were less than one micrometer in size. thirty-one hips had extracellular particles of polyethylene as well. twenty-two of the thirty-four hips had intracellular metallic debris; in ten, metallic debris was found extracellularly as well. ten of the sixteen cemented specimens had intracellular and extracellular polymethylmethacrylate debris. in the mechanically stable prostheses--cemented and uncemented--polyethylene wear debris was identified in areas of bone resorption far from the articular surfaces. the number of macrophages in a microscopic field was directly related to the amount of particulate polyethylene debris that was visible by light microscopy. although the gross radiographic appearances of linear bone loss and lytic bone loss were different, the histological appearance of the regions in which there was active bone resorption was similar. regardless of the radiographic appearance and anatomical origin of the specimen, bone resorption was found to occur in association with macrophages that were laden with polyethylene debris. in general, the number of macrophages present had a direct relationship to the degree of bone resorption that was seen. we believe that these findings indicate that joint fluid penetrates far more extensively than previously thought, even in a well fixed component, along the interface between the prosthesis and bone and in the periprosthetic tissues; it is often more extensive than is shown by arthrography. we therefore suggest the concept of the effective joint space to include all periprosthetic regions that are accessible to joint fluid and thus accessible to particulate debris.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
introduction certain personality traits and genetic polymorphisms are contributing factors to bipolar disorder and its symptomatology, and in turn, this syndrome influences personality. the aim of the present study is to compare the personality traits of euthymic bipolar patients with healthy controls and to investigate the effect of the catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) val158met genotype on those traits. we recruited thirty seven bipolar i patients in euthymic state following a manic episode and thirty healthy controls and evaluated their personality by means of the cloninger’s temperament and character inventory (version tci-r-140). we assessed the influence of the polymorphism val158met in the comt gene on the personality of these patients. the patients scored higher than controls in harm avoidance (61.3±12.5 vs. 55.3±8.1) and self-transcendence (45.3±12.8 vs. 32.7±8.2) and scored lower than controls in self-directedness (68.8±13.3 vs. 79.3±8.1), cooperativeness (77.1±9.1 vs. 83.9±6.5) and persistence (60.4±15.1 vs. 67.1±8.9). the novelty seeking dimension associates with the val158met comt genotype; patients with the low catabolic activity genotype, met/met, show a higher score than those with the high catabolic activity genotype, val/val. conclusions suffering from bipolar disorder could have an impact on personality. a greater value in harm avoidance may be a genetic marker for a vulnerability to the development of a psychiatric disorder, but not bipolar disorder particularly, while a low value in persistence may characterize affective disorders or a subgroup of bipolar patients. the association between novelty seeking scores and comt genotype may be linked with the role dopamine plays in the brain’s reward circuits. researchers using various psychological measures and instruments have concluded that the personality of remitted bipolars and normal controls are essentially similar. we recently suggested that specific personality traits might be genetic markers for manic-depressive illness. the tridimensional personality questionnaire (tpq) is a personality questionnaire with heritable subscales and hypothesized anchoring in neurochemistry. we studied the personality of euthymic bipolar manic depressive patients using the tpq. subjects were volunteers from the out-patient lithium clinic. tpqs were individually administered to 50 euthymic bipolar patients. persistence is significantly reduced, and harm avoidance and reward dependence significantly increased, compared with u.s. norms. these traits may be part of the genetic diathesis for manic-depressive illness.
background/aim: the role of laparoscopic appendectomy is still not well defined in the literature. this study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic appendectomy at a university hospital in a developing country. patients and methods: patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy (la) from august 2002 to august 2006 were identified. for each case, a control was selected from patients undergoing open appendectomy (oa) during the same year by systematic sampling. the groups were compared in terms of duration of surgery, requirement of narcotic analgesia, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and the overall cost for each patient. results: a total of 68 patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy during the study period. median duration of surgery was 82 minutes in la group and 70 minutes in oa group (p < 0.001). forty-five patients in la group and 64 in oa group required narcotic analgesia (p < 0.001). median length of hospital stay (p = 0.672) and postoperative complications (p = 0.779) were comparable in both groups. median cost of hospital stay was pakistani rupees (pkr) 47121/in la group and pkr 39318/in oa group, the difference being significant (p = 0.001). conclusions: laparoscopic appendectomy is feasible in developing countries with similar postoperative outcome and less requirement of narcotic analgesia. the duration of surgery and overall cost were significantly higher and efforts should be made to develop expertise and reduce operative time with resultant decrease in cost. development of standardized protocols for discharge of patients from the hospital after la may further reduce the cost and benefit patients in developing countries. background appendectomy can be performed using either a laparoscopic or an open technique. this study compares the outcome of patients treated for acute appendicitis by open appendectomy with the outcome of those undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy.   methods patients undergoing appendectomy at the mount sinai hospital between 1994 and 1998 were studied. outcome of patients having open appendectomy was compared with that of patients having laparoscopic appendectomy.   results seven hundred fifty-eight patients underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis during the 5-year study period. two hundred seventy-one (36%) had open appendectomy and 487 (64%) had laparoscopic appendectomy. patients subsequently found to have a normal appendix had the highest rate of laparoscopic appendectomy, whereas those with gangrenous appendicitis were most likely to have open appendectomy (p <0.05). there was a significant decline in the postoperative length of stay for open cases during the length of the study. in the final year, the difference in length of stay between open and laparoscopic appendectomy was only 1 day. patients with gangrenous appendicitis had a significantly longer length of stay than did patients with a normal appendix or suppurative appendicitis. the hospital cost of laparoscopic appendectomy was greater than that for open appendectomy but the extra expenditure in the operating room was offset by the longer length of stay of the patients having open surgery.   conclusions differences in outcome between open and laparoscopic appendectomy are minor. in this study, more difficult cases with gangrenous appendicitis were more likely to require open appendectomy whereas milder forms of appendicitis, especially in women, were more likely to be treated by laparoscopy. savings from the slightly shorter hospital stay after laparoscopic appendectomy are offset by the higher surgical cost of the laparoscopic equipment.
acetylcholine-binding proteins (achbps) from mollusks are suitable structural and functional surrogates of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors when combined with transmembrane spans of the nicotinic receptor. these proteins assemble as a pentamer with identical ach binding sites at the subunit interfaces and show ligand specificities resembling those of the nicotinic receptor for agonists and antagonists. a subset of ligands, termed the neonicotinoids, exhibit specificity for insect nicotinic receptors and selective toxicity as insecticides. achbps are of neither mammalian nor insect origin and exhibit a distinctive pattern of selectivity for the neonicotinoid ligands. we define here the binding orientation and determinants of differential molecular recognition for the neonicotinoids and classical nicotinoids by estimates of kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters and crystallographic analysis. neonicotinoid complex formation is rapid and accompanied by quenching of the achbp tryptophan fluorescence. comparisons of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiacloprid in the binding site from aplysia californica achbp at 2.48 and 1.94 å in resolution reveal a single conformation of the bound ligands with four of the five sites occupied in the pentameric crystal structure. the neonicotinoid electronegative pharmacophore is nestled in an inverted direction compared with the nicotinoid cationic functionality at the subunit interfacial binding pocket. characteristic of several agonists, loop c largely envelops the ligand, positioning aromatic side chains to interact optimally with conjugated and hydrophobic regions of the neonicotinoid. this template defines the association of interacting amino acids and their energetic contributions to the distinctive interactions of neonicotinoids. upon ligand binding at the subunit interfaces, the extracellular domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor undergoes conformational changes, and agonist binding allosterically triggers opening of the ion channel. the soluble acetylcholine‐binding protein (achbp) from snail has been shown to be a structural and functional surrogate of the ligand‐binding domain (lbd) of the receptor. yet, individual achbp species display disparate affinities for nicotinic ligands. the crystal structure of achbp from aplysia californica in the apo form reveals a more open loop c and distinctive positions for other surface loops, compared with previous structures. analysis of aplysia achbp complexes with nicotinic ligands shows that loop c, which does not significantly change conformation upon binding of the antagonist, methyllycaconitine, further opens to accommodate the peptidic antagonist, α‐conotoxin imi, but wraps around the agonists lobeline and epibatidine. the structures also reveal extended and nonoverlapping interaction surfaces for the two antagonists, outside the binding loci for agonists. this comprehensive set of structures reflects a dynamic template for delineating further conformational changes of the lbd of the nicotinic receptor.
malassezia, a skin colonizer, is associated with multiple skin disorders in adults, and cephalic pustulosis and folliculitis in children. it can cause fungemia in infants and neonates. the time and pattern of colonization, risk factors associated with colonization and causing fungemia in children, are not well understood. the prospective cohort study was conducted to determine the rate of malassezia species colonization and associated factors in hospitalized neonates and infants. consecutive 50 neonates and infants admitted in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units were studied. the skin swabs were collected on the day of admission and every fifth day, thereafter, till the patient was discharged or died. putative risk factors for the colonization of malassezia species were recorded. isolates were identified by phenotypic methods and sequencing of the d1 and d2 region of rdna. neonates were not colonized at the time of entry in neonatal icu or at birth. nineteen (38 %) neonates were colonized with malassezia species during their hospital stay. among the infants, three (6 %) came to icu with malassezia colonization and 26 (52 %) acquired malassezia during icu stay. mechanical ventilation, duration of hospital stay, central venous catheterization, and antifungal therapy were the significantly associated factors for colonization. malassezia furfur was the most common species isolated from the skin of infants and neonates. colonization by malassezia species in infants and neonates in a hospital is not uncommon and can be a potential source of nosocomial infection. malassezia furfur, a lipophilic yeast, has become recognized as a cause of sepsis in infants receiving parenteral fat emulsions via indwelling deep venous catheters. colonization of infants' skin may be a prerequisite to colonization of the intravascular catheter and subsequent infection with m furfur. three hundred ninety-three surveillance cultures were performed on 146 infants during their first 12 weeks of hospitalization in the intensive care unit (icu) or the neonatal transitional unit (ntu). in addition, 47 full-term newborn infants and 38 healthy infants in the well-baby clinic were cultured. colonization rates were greatest (48%) during the second month of hospitalization for the infants in the icu/ntu group. in contrast, 0 of 47 newborn infants and 2 of 38 healthy infants were colonized. prematurity and a prolonged length of stay were identified as risk factors for colonization.
the purpose of this study was to examine sex differences in the maturation of white matter during adolescence (12 to 18 years of age). we measured lobular volumes of white matter and white-matter "density" throughout the brain using t1-weighted images, and estimated the myelination index using magnetisation-transfer ratio (mtr). in male adolescents, we observed age-related increases in white-matter lobular volumes accompanied by decreases in the lobular values of white-matter mtr. white-matter density in the putative cortico-spinal tract (pcst) decreased with age. in female adolescents, on the other hand, we found only small age-related increase in white-matter volumes and no age-related changes in white-matter mtr, with the exception of the frontal lobe where mtr increased. white-matter density in the pcst also increased with age. these results suggest that sex-specific mechanisms may underlie the growth of white matter during adolescence. we speculate that these mechanisms involve primarily age-related increases in axonal calibre in males and increased myelination in females. we used voxel-based morphometry (vbm) to examine human brain asymmetry and the effects of sex and handedness on brain structure in 465 normal adults. we observed significant asymmetry of cerebral grey and white matter in the occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes (petalia), including heschl's gyrus, planum temporale (pt) and the hippocampal formation. males demonstrated increased leftward asymmetry within heschl's gyrus and pt compared to females. there was no significant interaction between asymmetry and handedness and no main effect of handedness. there was a significant main effect of sex on brain morphology, even after accounting for the larger global volumes of grey and white matter in males. females had increased grey matter volume adjacent to the depths of both central sulci and the left superior temporal sulcus, in right heschl's gyrus and pt, in right inferior frontal and frontomarginal gyri and in the cingulate gyrus. females had significantly increased grey matter concentration extensively and relatively symmetrically in the cortical mantle, parahippocampal gyri, and in the banks of the cingulate and calcarine sulci. males had increased grey matter volume bilaterally in the mesial temporal lobes, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and in the anterior lobes of the cerebellum, but no regions of increased grey matter concentration.
recent studies support roles for neurokinin-1 (nk-1) and gastrin-releasing peptide (grp) receptor-expressing spinal neurons in itch. we presently investigated expression of substance p (sp) and grp in pruritogen-responsive primary sensory neurons and roles for these neuropeptides in itch signaling. responses of dorsal root ganglion (drg) cells to various pruritogens were observed by calcium imaging. drg cells were then processed for sp, grp, and isolectin b-4 (ib4; a marker for nonpeptidergic neurons) immunofluorescence. of pruritogen-responsive drg cells, 11.8-26.8%, 21.8-40.0%, and 21.4-26.8% were immunopositive for sp, grp, and ib4, respectively. in behavioral studies, both systemic and intrathecal administration of a nk-1 receptor antagonist significantly attenuated scratching evoked by chloroquine and a protease-activated receptor 2 agonist, sligrl, but not histamine, bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8-22 (bam8-22), or serotonin. systemic or intrathecal administration of a grp receptor antagonist attenuated scratching evoked by chloroquine and sligrl but not bam8-22 or histamine. the grp receptor antagonist enhanced scratching evoked by serotonin. these results indicate that sp and grp expressed in primary sensory neurons are partially involved as neurotransmitters in histamine-independent itch signaling from the skin to the spinal cord. the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating histamine-independent itch in primary sensory neurons are largely unknown. itch induced by chloroquine (cq) is a common side effect of this widely used antimalarial drug. here, we show that mrgprs, a family of g protein-coupled receptors expressed exclusively in peripheral sensory neurons, function as itch receptors. mice lacking a cluster of mrgpr genes display significant deficits in itch induced by cq but not histamine. cq directly excites sensory neurons in an mrgpr-dependent manner. cq specifically activates mouse mrgpra3 and human mrgprx1. loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that mrgpra3 is required for cq responsiveness in mice. furthermore, mrgpra3-expressing neurons respond to histamine and coexpress gastrin-releasing peptide, a peptide involved in itch sensation, and mrgprc11. activation of these neurons with the mrgprc11-specific agonist bam8-22 induces itch in wild-type but not mutant mice. therefore, mrgprs may provide molecular access to itch-selective neurons and constitute novel targets for itch therapeutics.
over the past four decades, significant strides have been made in the science of preventing youth problem behaviors. subsequently, policymakers and funders have begun to insist on the use of evidence-based programs (ebps) as a requirement for funding. however, unless practitioners are able to sustain these programs beyond initial seed funding, they are unlikely to achieve their ultimate goal of broad public health impact. despite its obvious importance, sustainability has received relatively little attention in prevention science until recently. moreover, there have been few opportunities to study the correlates of sustainability in large-scale, multi-year initiatives involving multiple programs. the present study examined rates of sustainment of a wide range of proven-effective prevention and intervention programs; identified factors related to organizational support and readiness, program and implementer characteristics, and sustainability planning that distinguished sustained programs; and examined variability in these associations across classroom-based, community/mentoring, family-focused prevention, and family treatment program types within the context of a state-wide ebp dissemination initiative in pennsylvania over 4 years. the majority of ebps sustained functioning 2 years or more beyond their initial funding. in general, sustained programs reported greater community coalition functioning, communication to key stakeholders, knowledge of the program's logical model, communication with the trainer or program developer, and sustainability planning. in addition to these universal correlates, important program-specific correlates emerged as well. implications for the technical assistance and support necessary to promote the sustainability of ebps in nonresearch contexts are also discussed. this article presents an informed definition of sustainability and an associated planning model for sustaining innovations (pertinent to both infrastructure and interventions) within organizational, community, and state systems. the planning model stems from a systematic review of the literature and from concepts derived from a series of ‘think tanks’ made up of key substance abuse prevention professionals. the model assumes a five-step process (i.e. assessment, development, implementation, evaluation, and reassessment/modification) and addresses factors known to inhibit efforts to sustain an innovation. one set of factors concerns the capacity of prevention systems to support sustainable innovations. the other pertains to the extent to which a particular innovation is sustainable. a sustainability action strategy is presented that includes goals with corresponding sets of objectives, actions, and results that determine the extent of readiness to sustain an innovation. sustainability tools to assist in implementing the planning model are illustrated, and next steps for the model are discussed. this planning model provides a conceptual and practical understanding of sustainability that can lead to further investigation. q 2004 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
chronic stress, the administration of glucocorticoids and the prolonged activation of glucocorticoid receptors (grs) are reported to induce affective changes in humans and rodents that resemble a depressive state. however, data concerning the behavioral and molecular effects of the selective activation of specific grs are limited, and the conclusions derived remain debatable. in this study, our goal was to investigate the behavioral and molecular changes following the prolonged activation of grs in mice via exposure to the specific agonist dexamethasone (dex). c57bl/6j mice were injected daily with dex (4 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, and the behavior of the animals was assessed in the following paradigms: the forced swimming test (fst), the light-dark box test, the saccharin preference test and activity boxes. the mrna expression levels of the corticosteroid receptors mineralocorticoid (mr, nr3c2) and glucocorticoid (gr, nr3c1), selected stress dependent genes and glial markers were analyzed in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. dex-treated mice exhibited a variety of depression-like behaviors: increased time of immobility in the fst, a reduced preference for saccharin consumption and increased anxiety-like behavior. behavioral alterations were accompanied by a decrease in the mrna expression of gr and the increased expression of fkbp5 and sgk1 in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of dex-treated mice. furthermore, our results indicate a decrease in the mrna expression of glutamate aspartate transporter (glast, slc1a3), an astroglial cell marker, in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. these results demonstrate that the prolonged activation of gr receptors induced a depression-like state in mice, activated stress-related genes and induced a decrease in the mrna expression of glast, an astroglial marker, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. together, the results reported here challenge several hypotheses concerning the role of grs in the development of behavioral and molecular alterations relevant to stress-related disorders, such as depression, under the same experimental conditions. glucocorticoids stimulate the intestinal absorption of na(+) and water partly by regulation of the na(+)/h(+) exchanger 3 (nhe3). previous studies have shown both genomic and nongenomic regulation of nhe3 by glucocorticoids. serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (sgk1) has been shown to be part of this cascade, where phosphorylation of nhe3 by sgk1 initiates the translocation of nhe3 to the cell surface. in the present work, we examined a series of changes in sgk1 and nhe3 induced by glucocorticoids using human colonic caco-2 and opossum kidney cells. we found that dexamethasone rapidly stimulated sgk1 mrnas, but a significant change in protein abundance was not detected. instead, there was an increase in sgk1 kinase activity as early as at 2 h. an increase in nhe3 protein abundance was not detected until 12 h of dexamethasone exposure, although the transport activity was significantly stimulated at 4 h. these data demonstrate that the changes of sgk1 precede those of nhe3. chronic regulation (24 h) of nhe3 was blocked completely by prevention of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or actinomycin d and by the glucocorticoid receptor blocker ru486. the acute effect of dexamethasone was similarly abrogated by ru486, but was insensitive to cycloheximide and actinomycin d. similarly, the stimulation of sgk1 activity by dexamethasone was blocked by ru486 but not by actinomycin d. together, these data show that the acute effect of glucocorticoids on nhe3 is mediated by a glucocorticoid receptor dependent mechanism that activates sgk1 in a nongenomic manner.
background although pituitary‐dependent hyperadrenocorticism (pdh) is one of the most common endocrinopathies in dogs, the effects of withholding treatment on survival time in dogs with pdh remain unclear. hypothesis/objectives the purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of treatment in dogs with pdh by comparing survival times between dogs treated with trilostane and untreated dogs. animals forty‐three dogs diagnosed with pdh at a primary‐care hospital in japan between june 2009 and january 2014. methods retrospective cohort study. the medical records of dogs with pdh treated with trilostane (n = 17) or left untreated (n = 26) were reviewed retrospectively. survival analysis at 2 years after diagnosis of pdh was performed. results median survival time for the trilostane group was not reached (95% confidence interval [ci], 443 days–not applicable) and was significantly longer than the 506 days (95% ci, 292–564 days; p = .016) for the untreated group. multivariate cox proportional hazards analysis (including age at diagnosis, basal cortisol concentration at diagnosis, and treatment group) only identified assignment to the untreated group (hazard ratio, 5.01; 95% ci, 1.63–15.44) as associated with increased mortality. conclusions and clinical importance the results of this retrospective cohort study suggest that withholding treatment for dogs with pdh might be associated with a higher risk of death. this represents the largest study to date to report survival times of untreated dogs with pdh. the survival times of 148 dogs treated for pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism were studied using clinical records from 3 uk veterinary centers between 1998 and 2003. of these animals, 123 (83.1%) were treated with trilostane, while 25 (16.9%) were treated with mitotane. treatment groups were compared using t-tests and analysis of variance (or their nonparametric equivalents) and chi-square tests. survival data were analyzed using kaplan-meier survival plots and cox proportional hazard methods. there was no significant difference between the population attributes from each center or between treatment groups. the median survival time for animals treated with trilostane was 662 days (range 8-1,971) and for mitotane it was 708 days (range 33-1,399). there were no significant differences between the survival times for animals treated with trilostane and those treated with mitotane. in the multivariable model (including drug, center, breed group, weight, diagnostic group, and age at diagnosis), only age at diagnosis and weight were significantly negatively associated with survival. importantly, there was no significant effect of drug choice on survival.
in the mouse hippocampus normal levels of kynurenic acid (kyna), a neuroactive metabolite synthesized in astrocytes primarily by kynurenine aminotransferase ii (kat ii)-catalyzed transamination of l-kynurenine, maintain a degree of tonic inhibition of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs). the present in vitro study was designed to test the hypothesis that α7 nachr activity decreases when endogenous production of kyna increases. incubation (2–7 h) of rat hippocampal slices with kynurenine (200 μm) resulted in continuous de novo synthesis of kyna. kynurenine conversion to kyna was significantly decreased by the kat ii inhibitor (s)-(−)-9-(4-aminopiperazine-1-yl)-8-fluoro-3-methyl-6-oxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-4h-1-oxa-3a-azaphenalene-5carboxylic acid (bff122) (100 μm) and was more effective in slices from postweaned than preweaned rats. incubation of slices from postweaned rats with kynurenine inhibited α7 nachrs and extrasynaptic n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (nmdars) on ca1 stratum radiatum interneurons. these effects were attenuated by bff122 and mimicked by exogenously applied kyna (200 μm). exposure of human cerebral cortical slices to kynurenine also inhibited α7 nachrs. the α7 nachr sensitivity to kyna is age-dependent, because neither endogenously produced nor exogenously applied kyna inhibited α7 nachrs in slices from preweaned rats. in these slices, kynurenine-derived kyna also failed to inhibit extrasynaptic nmdars, which could, however, be inhibited by exogenously applied kyna. in slices from preweaned and postweaned rats, glutamatergic synaptic currents were not affected by endogenously produced kyna, but were inhibited by exogenously applied kyna. these results suggest that in the mature brain α7 nachrs and extrasynaptic nmdars are in close apposition to kyna release sites and, thereby, readily accessible to inhibition by endogenously produced kyna. abstract: this study was designed to investigate modulatory mechanisms that control the synthesis of the neuroprotective endogenous excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenate. de novo kynurenate formation was examined in vitro using tissue slices from rat brain, liver, and kidney. in slices from adult cerebral cortex, veratridine, quisqualate, and l‐α‐aminoadipate decreased kynurenate synthesis substantially. glucose removal or changes in the ionic milieu, too, influenced kynurenate formation significantly, suggesting that demands on cellular energy interfere with kynurenate production in the adult rat brain. the effects of quisqualate and l‐α‐aminoadipate were also observed in the immature brain, in the quinolinate‐lesioned adult striatum, and, to a lesser extent, in peripheral organs. in contrast, the effect of veratridine was not seen in the lesioned brain or in kidney and liver tissue, indicating its dependency on intact neuron‐glia interactions. compared with the normal adult brain, ionic manipulations yielded qualitatively distinct results in the developing brain and in the periphery, but their effects remained unchanged in the lesioned striatum. glucose deprivation was less consequential in the immature than in the adult brain and was entirely ineffective in the lesioned striatum and in the periphery. these results further link cellular, especially astrocytic, energy metabolism to kynurenate formation in the brain. more generally, the existence of brain‐specific mechanisms for the regulation of kynurenate production is suggestive of a modulatory role of this metabolite in excitatory amino acid receptor function and dysfunction.
background. there are limited data on pertussis in african children, including among human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)–exposed infants. we conducted population-based hospital surveillance to determine the incidence and clinical presentation of bordetella pertussis–associated hospitalization in perinatal hiv-exposed and -unexposed infants. methods. children <12 months of age hospitalized with any sign or symptom of respiratory illness (including suspected sepsis or apnea in neonates) were enrolled from 1 january 2015 to 31 december 2015. detailed clinical and demographic information was recorded and respiratory samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results. the overall b. pertussis pcr positivity was 2.3% (42/1839), of which 86% (n = 36) occurred in infants <3 months of age. bordetella pertussis was detected in 2.1% (n = 26/1257) of hiv-unexposed and 2.7% (n = 16/599) of hiv-exposed infants. the incidence (per 1000) of b. pertussis–associated hospitalization was 2.9 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.8–4.5) and 1.9 (95% ci, 1.3–2.6) in hiv-exposed and hiv-unexposed infants, respectively (p = .09). the overall in-hospital case fatality ratio among the cases was 4.8% (2/42), both deaths of which occurred in hiv-exposed infants <3 months of age. among cases, presence of cough ≥14 days (20.5%) and paroxysmal coughing spells (33.3%) at diagnosis were uncommon. only 16 (38%) b. pertussis–associated hospitalizations fulfilled the centers for diseases control and prevention case definition of “definite” pertussis. conclusions. bordetella pertussis contributed to a modest proportion of all-cause respiratory illness hospitalization among black-african children, with a trend for higher incidence among hiv-exposed than hiv-unexposed infants. maternal vaccination of pregnant women should be considered to reduce the burden of pertussis hospitalization in this population. background. there is a paucity of data regarding the burden of bordetella pertussis in african women and young infants, and particularly the impact of maternal human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection thereon. we performed a retrospective analysis of respiratory illness samples from longitudinal cohorts of hiv-uninfected and hiv-infected women and their infants to evaluate the burden of pertussis illness in a black-african community. methods. the women were followed up for respiratory illness from midpregnancy and together with their infants until 24 weeks postpartum. respiratory samples obtained at the time of illness visits were tested for b. pertussis by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results. the study included 194 hiv-infected and 1060 hiv-uninfected women, and 188 and 1028 infant offspring, respectively. there were 7 pcr-confirmed pertussis cases in the hiv-exposed infants and 30 in hiv-unexposed infants (7.4 vs 5.5 episodes per 1000 infant-months; p = .47), at a mean age of 70.9 days. all infant pertussis cases had a history of cough (mean duration, 6.3 days). six of 17 (35.3%) pertussis-confirmed cases in infants <2 months of age were admitted to hospital within 21 days of b. pertussis detection, whereas none of the 20 cases ≥2 months of age required hospitalization. ten pcr-positive pertussis-associated illnesses were detected in hiv-infected women compared with 32 in the hiv-uninfected women (6.8 vs 3.9 episodes per 1000 person-months; p = .12). conclusions. bordetella pertussis identification was common among young infants with respiratory illness, most of whom were too young to be fully protected through direct vaccination. vaccination of pregnant women might be a valuable strategy in a setting such us ours to prevent b. pertussis–associated illness in women and their young infants.
backgroundtwo fifths of the world's population is at risk from dengue. the absence of effective drugs and vaccines leaves vector control as the primary intervention tool. understanding dengue virus (denv) host interactions is essential for the development of novel control strategies. the availability of genome sequences for both human and mosquito host greatly facilitates genome-wide studies of denv-host interactions.resultswe developed the first draft of the mosquito protein interaction network using a computational approach. the weighted network includes 4,214 aedes aegypti proteins with 10,209 interactions, among which 3,500 proteins are connected into an interconnected scale-free network. we demonstrated the application of this network for the further annotation of mosquito proteins and dissection of pathway crosstalk. using three datasets based on physical interaction assays, genome-wide rna interference (rnai) screens and microarray assays, we identified 714 putative denv-associated mosquito proteins. an integrated analysis of these proteins in the network highlighted four regions consisting of highly interconnected proteins with closely related functions in each of replication/transcription/translation (rtt), immunity, transport and metabolism. putative denv-associated proteins were further selected for validation by rnai-mediated gene silencing, and dengue viral titer in mosquito midguts was significantly reduced for five out of ten (50.0%) randomly selected genes.conclusionsour results indicate the presence of common host requirements for denv in mosquitoes and humans. we discuss the significance of our findings for pharmacological intervention and genetic modification of mosquitoes for blocking dengue transmission. abstract the matrix (m) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) is a potent inhibitor of bidirectional nuclear transport. here we demonstrate that inhibition occurs when m protein is in the nucleus ofxenopus laevis oocytes and that m activity is readily reversed by a monoclonal antibody (αm). we identify a region of m protein, amino acids 51 to 59, that is required both for inhibition of transport and for efficient recognition by αm. when expressed in transfected hela cells, m protein colocalizes with nuclear pore complexes (npcs) at the nuclear rim. moreover, mutation of a single amino acid, methionine 51, eliminates both transport inhibition and targeting to npcs. we propose that m protein inhibits bidirectional transport by interacting with a component of the npc or an npc-associated factor that participates in nucleocytoplasmic transport.
ulam (1961) apparently first posed the following question: what is the average (or distribution of) the length ln of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation of the first n integers? experimental (monte-carlo) evidence has played an important role in the study of ln begining with ulam (1961), and continuing with baer and brock (1969), and odlyzko and rains (2000). we present experimental evidence concerning the distribution of the length ln of the longest increasing increasing subsequence of a random permutation of length n. in particular, the experimental data confirm the known result e(ln) ∼ 2 √ n and strongly suggest that v ar(ln) ∼ cn for a constant c ≈ .818 . . .. this supports and complements the recent results of baik, deift, and johansson (1999), who apparently knew of the monte-carlo results of odlyzko and rains (2000). in the last section we also combine our experimental results with those of odlyzko and rains (2000). ams 2000 subject classifications. primary: 60g15, 60g99; secondary 60e05. the expected value of l n , the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation of f1; : : : ; ng, has been studied extensively. this paper presents the results of both monte carlo and exact computations that explore the ner structure of the distribution of l n. the results suggested that several of the conjectures that had been made about l n were incorrect, and led to new conjectures, some of which have been proved recently by jinho baik, percy deift, and kurt johansson. in particular, the standard deviation of l n is of order n 1=6 , contrary to earlier conjectures. this paper also explains some regular patterns in the distribution of l n .
considerable evidence suggests that arginine vasopressin (avp) is critically involved in the regulation of many social and nonsocial behaviors, including emotionality. the existence of two avp receptors in the brain, namely the v1a and v1b subtypes, and the lack of clear pharmacological data using selective agonists or antagonists, make it difficult to determine which receptor is responsible for the avp-mediated effects on behavior. here we report the behavioral effects of a null mutation in the v1a receptor (v1ar) in male mice. male mice lacking functional v1ar (v1arko) exhibit markedly reduced anxiety-like behavior and a profound impairment in social recognition. v1arko performed normally on spatial and nonsocial olfactory learning and memory tasks. acute central administration of avp robustly stimulated stereotypical scratching and autogrooming in wild-type (wt), but not v1arko males. avp and oxytocin (ot) mrna and ot receptor-binding levels were similar in wt and v1arko mice. given the current findings, the v1ar may provide a novel potential pharmacological target for social and affective disorders including autism, and anxiety disorders. vasopressin and oxytocin, as well as their biosynthetic congeners, the neurophysins, have been described in fiber tracts originating from several hypothalamic and limbic structure^.^^'.' lhrget areas of these fiber systems appear to be located in the lower brain stem, including the nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal column the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord;6 and limbic forebrain structures including the lateral septum, the medial nucleus of the arnygdala, and the lateral habenular cerebrospinal fluid (csf) vasopressin levels, although influenced by osmotic stimuli and hemorrhage, do not always parallel the vasopressin concentrations in plasma, suggesting that csf vasopressin is derived from central release rather than the bloodstream or posterior pituitary gland.’o.l1 behavioral and autonomic changes described after administration of these peptides either intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or locally into specific brain areas include alterations of learning and memory processes, development and maintenance of tolerance to and dependence on ethanol and opiate^,^^-^^ hypothermia and antipyresis,’**’ analgesia,” changes of cardiovascular f~nction,’~-’~ an influence on intracranial self-stimulation,’’ and spontaneous behavioral changes.’*-” the induction of grooming and scratching behavior in mice after acute i.c.v. injection was first described by delanoy et al. in 1978.’* the present report describes studies on the behavioral characteristics, pharmacology, structure-activity relationship, and possible sites of action for grooming and scratching behavior induced by vasopressin and oxytocin.
natural surface drinking water sources with the increasing chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cdom) have profound influences on the aquatic environment and drinking water safety. here, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of cdom in fengshuba reservoir and its catchments in china. twenty-four surface water samples, 45 water samples (including surface water, middle water, and bottom water), and 15 pore water samples were collected from rivers, reservoir, and sediment of the reservoir, respectively. then, three fluorescent components, namely two humic-like components (c1 and c2) and a tryptophan-like component (c3), were identified from the excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (eem-parafac) for all samples. for spatial distributions, the levels of cdom and two humic-like components in the reservoir were significantly lower than those in the upstream rivers (p < 0.01), indicating that the reservoir may act as a reactor to partly reduce the levels of exogenous input including cdom and humic-like matters from the surrounding catchment. for temporal variations, the mean levels of cdom and three fluorescent components did not significantly change in rivers, suggesting that perennial anthropic activity maybe an important factor impacting the concentration and composition of river cdom but not the precipitation and runoff. however, these mean values of cdom for the bulk waters of the reservoir changed markedly along with seasonal variations, indicating that the hydrological processes in the reservoir could control the quality and quantity of cdom. the different correlations between the fluorescent components and primary water parameters in the river, reservoir, and pore water samples further suggest that the reservoir is an important factor regulating the migration and transformation of fdom along with the variations of different environmental gradients. taihu basin is the most developed area in china, which economic development has resulted in pollutants being produced and discharged into rivers and the lake. lake taihu is located in the center of the basin, which is characterized by a complex network of rivers and channels. to assess the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter (dom) in surface waters, we determined the components and abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cdom) within lake taihu and 66 of its tributaries, and 22 sites along transects from two main rivers. in lake taihu, there was a relative less spatial variation in cdom absorption a(cdom)(355) with a mean of 2.46 ± 0.69 m⁻¹ compared to the mean of 3.36 ± 1.77 m⁻¹ in the rivers. two autochthonous tryptophan-like components (c1 and c5), two humic-like components (c2 and c3), and one autochthonous tyrosine-like component (c4) were identified using the parallel factor analysis (parafac) model. the c2 and c3 had a direct relationship with a(cdom)(355), dissolved organic carbon (doc), and chemical oxygen demand (cod). the separation of lake samples from river samples, on both axes of the principal component analysis (pca), showed the difference in dom fluorophores between these various environments. components c1 and c5 concurrently showed positive factor 1 loadings, while c4 was close to the negative factor 1 axis. components c2 and c3 showed positive second factor loadings. the major contribution of autochthonous tryptophan-like components to lake samples is due to the autochthonous production of cdom in the lake ecosystems. the results also showed that the differences in geology and associated land use control cdom dynamics, such as the high levels of cdom with terrestrial characteristics in the northwestern upstream rivers and low levels of cdom with increased microbial characteristics in the southwestern upstream rivers. most of river samples from the downstream regions in the eastern and southeastern plains had a similar relative abundance of humic-like fluorescence, with less of the tryptophan-like and more of the tyrosine-like contributions than did samples from upstream regions.
the separation of embryonic from extra-embryonic tissues within the inner cell mass to generate the epiblast (epi), which will form the new organism, from the primitive endoderm (pe), which will form the yolk sac, is a crucial developmental decision. here, we identify a chromatin modifier, satb1, with a distinct role in this decision. satb1 is differentially expressed within 16-cell-stage embryos, with higher expression levels in the inner cell mass progenitor cells. depleting satb1 increases the number of epi cells at the expense of pe. this phenotype can be rescued by simultaneous depletion of both satb1 and satb2, owing to their antagonistic effect on the pluripotency regulator nanog. consequently, increasing satb1 expression leads to differentiation into pe and a decrease in epi, as a result of the modulation of expression of several pluripotency- and differentiation-related genes by satb1. finally, we show that satb1 is a downstream target of the fgf signalling pathway, linking chromatin modification and fgf signalling. together, these results identify a role for satb1 in the lineage choice between pluripotency and differentiation and further our understanding of early embryonic lineage segregation. summary: satb1 regulates the cell fate choice between pluripotency and differentiation in the early mouse embryo and is a downstream target of the fgf signalling pathway. fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) are thought to influence many processes in vertebrate development because of their diverse sites of expression and wide range of biological activities in in vitro culture systems. as a means of elucidating embryonic functions of fgf-4, gene targeting was used to generate mice harboring a disrupted fgf4 gene. embryos homozygous for the null allele underwent uterine implantation and induced uterine decidualization but did not develop substantially thereafter. as was consistent with their behavior in vivo, fgf4 null embryos cultured in vitro displayed severely impaired proliferation of the inner cell mass, whereas growth and differentiation of the inner cell mass were rescued when null embryos were cultured in the presence of fgf-4 protein.
we reported evaluation of a colorimetric mic assessment for routine susceptibility testing of non-fastidious bacteria, with addition of growth indicators (int and mtt). our results made us postulate that the use of such indicators was unnecessary for mic determination in routine microdilution method. the aim of this study was to screen and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of indigenous jordanian plant extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, using the rapid xtt assay and viable count methods. xtt rapid assay was used for the initial screening of antimicrobial activity for the plant extracts. antimicrobial activity of potentially active plant extracts was further assessed using the "viable plate count" method. four degrees of antimicrobial activity (high, moderate, weak and inactive) against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, were recorded. the plant extracts of hypericum triquetrifolium, ballota undulata, ruta chalepensis, ononis natrix, paronychia argentea and marrubium vulgare had shown promising antimicrobial activity. this study showed that while both xtt and viable count methods are comparable when estimating the overall antimicrobial activity of experimental substances, there is no strong linear correlation between the two methods.
background and aimslitter decomposition is a critical process in terrestrial ecosystems and understanding the effects of soil fertility on the litter decay rate is of great ecological relevance. here we test the hypothesis that n transfer from soil to litter will promote the decay rate of n poor but not n rich litter types.methodsten organic substrates, encompassing a wide range of biochemical quality in terms of c/n and lignin/n ratios, were decomposed in microcosms over three soil types with different n content, but inoculated with the same microbiome. organic substrates were characterized for mass loss, c and n content to assess n transfer from soil to litter.resultsthe decay rate response to soil fertility was related to their initial n content: positive for substrates with little initial n content and not significant for n rich plant residues. a significant n transfer, generally larger from n rich soil to n poor substrates, was found. litter c/n and lignin/n ratios showed variable relationships with the litter decay according with the soil fertility gradient, with positive and negative correlations in n rich and n poor soils, respectively.conclusionsour study demonstrated that the decomposition of n rich litter proceeded irrespective of soil fertility while the decay rate of n poor substrates, either lignin poor or rich, was controlled by soil fertility likely as a result of n transfer. litter c/n and lignin/n ratios were reliable indicators of litter quality to predict their decay rate in n poor soil, but not in n rich soils. litter decomposition provides the primary source of mineral nitrogen (n) for biological activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. a 10-year decomposition experiment in 21 sites from seven biomes found that net n release from leaf litter is dominantly driven by the initial tissue n concentration and mass remaining regardless of climate, edaphic conditions, or biota. arid grasslands exposed to high ultraviolet radiation were an exception, where net n release was insensitive to initial n. roots released n linearly with decomposition and exhibited little net n immobilization. we suggest that fundamental constraints on decomposer physiologies lead to predictable global-scale patterns in net n release during decomposition.
given an aftermath of a cascade in the network, i.e. a set vi of "infected" nodes after an epidemic outbreak or a propagation of rumors/worms/viruses, how can we infer the sources of the cascade? answering this challenging question is critical for computer forensic, vulnerability analysis, and risk management. despite recent interest towards this problem, most of existing works focus only on single source detection or simple network topologies, e.g. trees or grids. in this paper, we propose a new approach to identify infection sources by searching for a seed set s that minimizes the symmetric difference between the cascade from s and vi, the given set of infected nodes. our major result is an approximation algorithm, called sisi, to identify infection sources without the prior knowledge on the number of source nodes. sisi, to our best knowledge, is the first algorithm with provable guarantee for the problem in general graphs. it returns a 2/((1-ε)2 δ-approximate solution with high probability, where δ denotes the maximum number of nodes in vi that may infect a single node in the network. our experiments on real-world networks show the superiority of our approach and sisi in detecting true source(s), boosting the f1-measure from few percents, for the state-of-the-art netsleuth, to approximately 50%. assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.
loyal buyer-seller relationships can arise by design, e.g. when a seller tailors a product to a specific market niche to accomplish the best possible returns, and buyers respond to the dedicated efforts the seller makes to meet their needs. we ask whether it is possible, instead, for loyalty to arise spontaneously, and in particular as a consequence of repeated interaction and co-adaptation among the agents in a market. we devise a stylized model of double auction markets and adaptive traders that incorporates these features. traders choose where to trade (which market) and how to trade (to buy or to sell) based on their previous experience. we find that when the typical scale of market returns (or, at fixed scale of returns, the intensity of choice) become higher than some threshold, the preferred state of the system is segregated: both buyers and sellers are segmented into subgroups that are persistently loyal to one market over another. we characterize the segregated state analytically in the limit of large markets: it is stabilized by some agents acting cooperatively to enable trade, and provides higher rewards than its unsegregated counterpart both for individual traders and the population as a whole. self-tuning experience weighted attraction (ewa) is a one-parameter theory of learning in  games. it addresses a criticism that an earlier model (ewa) has too many parameters, by  fixing some parameters at plausible values and replacing others with functions of experience  so that they no longer need to be estimated. consequently, it is econometrically simpler  than the popular weighted fictitious play and reinforcement learning models.  the functions of experience which replace free parameters “self-tune” over time, adjusting  in a way that selects a sensible learning rule to capture subjects’ choice dynamics. for  instance, the self-tuning ewa model can turn from a weighted fictitious play into an averaging  reinforcement learning as subjects equilibrate and learn to ignore inferior foregone  payoffs. the theory was tested on seven different games, and compared to the earlier parametric  ewa model and a one-parameter stochastic equilibrium theory (qre). self-tuning  ewa does as well as ewa in predicting behavior in new games, even though it has fewer  parameters, and fits reliably better than the qre equilibrium benchmark.
background: health care workers frequently suffer from complaints of musculoskeletal disorders and they are prone to long-term sick leave, as their work involves considerable physical demands. objective: to follow-up and evaluate longer term effects measured one year after baseline of “tailored physical activity” (tpa) versus a reference group (ref) in reducing number of self-reported sickness absence days for health care workers. methods: in this randomised controlled trial, health care workers (n=54) with musculoskeletal pain in the back or upper body were included and randomised to tpa or ref. all participants participated in individual health counselling (1.5 hours). tpa consisted of both aerobic fitness training and strengthening exercises (three times 50minute/week during 10 weeks). ref received only health guidance. at baseline and after the intervention period the participants were assessed with a questionnaire and health-related measures. results: in the longer term, the tpa showed a significant effect compared to ref in the ability to reduce sickness absence related to troubles in the musculoskeletal system. in tpa 81.5% reported no sickness absence within the last three months compared to 59.3% in ref. significant improvements were also seen for kinesiophobia (p<0.01) and pain (p<0.01) from baseline to follow-up. conclusion: results indicate that physical activity interventions can encourage health care workers to be more active and achieve improvements in kinesiophobia and pain intensity, thereby preventing sickness absence. backgroundhealth care workers have high physical work demands, involving patient handling and manual work tasks. a strategy for prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders can enhance the physical capacity of the health care worker. the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 'tailored physical activity’ for health care workers in the sonderborg municipality.methods/designthis protocol describes the design of a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of 'tailored physical activity’ versus a reference group for health care workers in the sonderborg municipality. inclusion criteria to be fulfilled: health care workers with daily work that includes manual work and with the experience of work-related musculoskeletal pain in the back or upper body.all participants will receive 'health guidance’, a (90-minute) individualised dialogue focusing on improving life style, based on assessments of risk behaviour, on motivation for change and on personal resources. in addition, the experimental groups will receive 'tailored physical activity’ (three 50-minute sessions per week over 10 weeks). the reference group will receive only 'health guidance’.the primary outcome measure is the participants’ self-reported sickness absence during the last three months due to musculoskeletal troubles, measured 3 and 12 months after baseline.in addition, secondary outcomes include anthropometric measurements, functional capacity and self-reported number of sick days, musculoskeletal symptoms, self-reported health, work ability, work productivity, physical capacity, kinesiophobia and physical functional status.discussionthe results from this study will contribute to the knowledge about evidence-based interventions for prevention of sickness absence among health care workers.trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov: nct01543984.
there is an urgent global need for effective and affordable approaches to cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. in developing nations, cervical malignancies remain the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. this reality may be difficult to accept given that these deaths are largely preventable; where cervical screening programs have been implemented, cervical cancer-related deaths have decreased dramatically. in developed countries, the challenges of cervical disease stem from high costs and overtreatment. the national cancer institute-funded program project is evaluating the applicability of optical technologies in cervical cancer. the mandate of the project is to create tools for disease detection and diagnosis that are inexpensive, require minimal expertise, are more accurate than existing modalities, and can be feasibly implemented in a variety of clinical settings. this article presents the status and long-term goals of the project. objective this review evaluates the diagnostic efficacy of fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, and their combination that use both point probe and multispectral imaging approaches in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo.   methods articles were selected for this review from a literature search which report the performance of fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy devices in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo. this analysis focused on the comparison of point probe versus multispectral approaches; the use of fluorescence, reflectance, and their combination; and finally the types of populations that have been studied for in vivo diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (sil).   results twenty-six studies were included and their heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analysis. though point probes were expected to have greater specificity and multispectral approaches greater sensitivity, there was considerable overlap in the performance of point probe and multispectral devices. there were few studies that studied fluorescence spectroscopy alone and reflectance spectroscopy alone. combined fluorescence and reflectance approaches showed considerable overlap among point probe and multispectral devices. the overlap of performance suggests that fluorescence and reflectance may have similar performance. currently the paucity of data precludes definitive conclusions regarding the additive effect of both approaches. only two of twenty-six trials have recruited patients with no history of an abnormal papanicolaou smear (screening populations) and twenty-four trials include patients with a range of cervical abnormalities from atypia to cancer (diagnostic populations).   discussion optical spectroscopy using a point probe and multispectral approaches appears to overlap in performance. fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopies examine different aspects of epithelial-stromal biology and appear to yield similar diagnostic performance. while intuitively appealing, their combination may or may not be additive. there have been few studies of these technologies in screening populations. better definitions of device trial design and reporting requirements would facilitate combining analyses to formally examine performance.
while much research has focused on the evolution of conspicuous male displays, ornaments and behaviours, less is understood about the evolution of similar traits in females. to determine whether females express these traits as nonadaptive by-products of sexual selection favouring the same traits in males or whether females are directly selected to express such traits, the benefits of these traits must be understood. the prevalence of aggression in female–female competition suggests that females may experience direct sexual selection for aggressiveness, but data are lacking. i used the tree swallow, tachycineta bicolor, to test the hypothesis that selection directly favours aggressiveness in females during intrasexual competition over nesting sites. after assaying the aggressiveness of a population of tree swallows, i experimentally reduced the number of nesting cavities, a resource required for female reproductive success. more aggressive females were more likely to obtain nesting cavities after the experimental reduction, while female age and male aggressiveness did not predict nesting cavity acquisition. aggressive behaviour in female tree swallows is therefore beneficial in the context of female–female competition for a critical breeding resource. these results indicate that the processes favouring aggressiveness in intrasexual competition among females may not be very different from the processes shaping aggressive behaviour in males. there has recently been an increase in interest in the notion that female ornamentation is selected through male choice, rather than being an artefact of selection on male ornamentation. there are, however, key differences between the sexes in the type of selection pressures that are likely to generate ornamentation and important differences in investment tradeoffs. here, i discuss that female ornamentation might be selected more often through female competition over resources than through competition over mates, as exemplified in a recent study by heinsohn and colleagues.
cytauxzoon felis, a protozoan parasite of wild and domestic felids, is the causative agent of cytauxzoonosis in domestic and some exotic felids in the united states. the bobcat (lynx rufus) is the natural reservoir for this parasite, but other felids such as florida panthers (puma concolor coryii) and domestic cats may maintain long-term parasitemias and serve as reservoirs. experimentally, two tick species, dermacentor variabilis and amblyomma americanum, have demonstrated the ability to transmit c. felis. these two tick species have overlapping distributions throughout much of the southeastern united states. the objective of the current study was to determine the distribution and prevalence of c. felis in free-ranging bobcat populations from 13 states including california, colorado, florida, georgia, kansas, kentucky, missouri, north carolina, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, south carolina, and west virginia. these states were selected because of differential vector presence; d. variabilis is present in each of these states except for the region of colorado sampled and a. americanum is currently known to be present only in a subset of these states. blood or spleen samples from 696 bobcats were tested for c. felis infection by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay which targeted the first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (its-1). significantly higher prevalences of c. felis were detected from missouri (79%, n=39), north carolina (63%, n=8), oklahoma (60%, n=20), south carolina (57%, n=7), kentucky (55%, n=74), florida (44%, n=45), and kansas (27%, n=41) compared with georgia (9%, n=159), north dakota (2.4%, n=124), ohio (0%, n=19), west virginia (0%, n=37), california (0%, n=26), and colorado (0%, n=67). in addition to bobcats, seven cougars (puma concolor) from georgia, louisiana, and north dakota and one serval (leptailurus serval) from louisiana were tested for c. felis. only one cougar from louisiana was pcr positive, which represents the first report of an infected cougar outside of the florida panther population. these data also indicate that c. felis is present in north dakota where infection has not been reported in domestic cats. based on a nonparametric analysis, prevalence rates were significantly higher in states where there are established populations of a. americanum, which supports recent data on the experimental transmission of c. felis by a. americanum and the fact that domestic cat clinical cases are temporally associated with a. americanum activity. collectively, these data confirm that bobcats are a common reservoir for c. felis and that a. americanum is likely an epidemiologically important vector. a male domestic shorthair cat was presented with lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia and respiratory harshness. diagnostic clinical chemistries, viral identification and tissue fluorescent antibody testing were negative or revealed no underlying system failure. histopathology examination revealed multifocal, variable sized and shaped protozoal life forms in the brain, heart, lung, intestine, spleen, lymph node and kidney consistent with the intraleukocytic schizonts of cytauxzoon felis.
associations between polymorphisms of the osteoprotegerin gene (opg) and bone mineral density (bmd) have been studied by several research groups, but results are mixed. accordingly, the authors performed a meta-analysis on studies of associations between opg polymorphisms and bmd. appropriate studies were identified using medline and by manual searching. a total of eight separate comparisons were considered in this meta-analysis. individuals with the gg genotype of g1181c were found to have a significantly lower mean lumbar bmd than subjects with the cc genotype (wmds −0.051 g/cm2, 95% confidence interval −0.079−−0.023, p < 0.001), and similar results were obtained in european and asian populations. in contrast to g1181c, no association was found between the a163g and t950c polymorphisms and lumbar bmd. in terms of femoral neck bmd, the gg genotype of g1181c was associated with a significantly lower bmd than the cc genotype in europeans but not in asians. total hip bmd was lower for the gg genotype of g1181c than for the cc or gc genotypes in europeans. a difference in total hip bmd was found between the ag and gg genotypes of the a163g polymorphism by meta-analyses in europeans, but no differences were found between the genotypes of the t950c polymorphism and total hip bmd in europeans. summarizing, the present study demonstrates that the opg g1181c polymorphism is associated with lumbar bmd in europeans and asians, and with femoral neck and total hip bmd in europeans only. given that osteoprotegerin plays an important role in bone remodeling, the osteoprotegerin gene may be a candidate locus for susceptibility to osteoporosis. the relation of polymorphisms in the promoter of the osteoprotegerin gene to bone mineral density (bmd) was examined in a japanese population-based prospective cohort study with randomly recruited subjects (1095 women and 1125 men for the 950t --> c polymorphism, 1094 women and 1127 men for the 245t --> g polymorphism). bmd at the radius was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and that for the total body, lumbar spine, right femoral neck, right trochanter, and right ward's triangle was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. genotypes were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific dna primer assay system. among 950t --> c genotypes, bmd for the proximal radius was lower in premenopausal women with the cc genotype than in those with the tt or tc genotype; the difference in bmd between the two groups was 3.9% (p=0.0075). among 245t --> g genotypes, bmd for the radius, total body, femoral neck, trochanter, and ward's triangle was lower in postmenopausal women with the gg genotype than in those with the tt or tg genotype, the tt genotype, or the tg genotype; the differences in bmd between the gg genotype and the tt or tg genotype were 19.8% for the distal radius (p=0.0015), 13.1% for the proximal radius (p=0.0095), 11.2% for the total body (p=0.0013), 12.9% for the femoral neck (p=0.0067), 18.7% for the trochanter (p=0.0008), and 27.1% for ward's triangle (p=0.0038). bmd was not associated with the 950t --> c or 245t --> g genotypes in men. the present results implicate the osteoprotegerin gene as a susceptibility locus for reduced bmd in japanese women.
backgroundaspergillus terreus causes invasive aspergillosis (ia) in immunocompromised individuals and can be the leading cause of ia in certain medical centers. we examined a large isolate collection (n = 117) for the presence of cryptic a. terreus species and employed a genome scanning method, inter-simple sequence repeat (issr) pcr to determine a. terreus population structure.resultscomparative sequence analyses of the calmodulin locus revealed the presence of the recently recognized species a. alabamensis (n = 4) in this collection. maximum parsimony, neighbor joining, and bayesian clustering of the issr data from the 113 sequence-confirmed a. terreus isolates demonstrated that one clade was composed exclusively of isolates from europe and another clade was enriched for isolates from the us.conclusionsthis study provides evidence of a population structure linked to geographical origin in a. terreus. abstract phylogenetic analyses of sequences generated from portions of three genes coding for the proteins enolase (enoa), β-tubulin (bena), and calmodulin (calm) of a large number of isolates within the section terrei, genus aspergillus, revealed the presence of a new cryptic species within this section, aspergillus alabamensis. most members of this new cryptic species were recovered as colonizing isolates from immunocompetent patient populations, had decreased in vitro susceptibilities to the antifungal drug amphotericin b, and were morphologically similar to but genetically distinct from aspergillus terreus isolates.
an approach for 3d bone tissue generation from embryonic stem (es) cells was investigated. the es cells were induced to differentiate into osteogenic precursors, capable of proliferating and subsequently differentiating into bone-forming cells. the differentiated cells and the seeded scaffolds were characterized using von kossa and alizarin red staining, electron microscopy, and rt-pcr analysis. the results demonstrated that es-derived bone-forming cells attached to and colonized the biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds. furthermore, these cells produced bone nodules when grown for 3–4 weeks in mineralization medium containing ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate both in tissue culture plates and in scaffolds. the differentiated cells also expressed osteospecific markers when grown both in the culture plates and in 3d scaffolds. osteogenic cells expressed alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and osteopontin, but not an es cell-specific marker, oct-4. these findings suggest that es cell can be used for in vitro tissue engineering and cultivation of graftable skeletal structures. the optimization of seeding and culturing of human osteoblast-like cells on three collagen-based biomaterials (bovine, equine and calf collagen membrane) was studied by cell proliferation and cell colonization (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. osteoblasts of five patients were seeded onto the three biomaterials and two different parameters were varied: the time intervals between initial seeding and adding culture medium (2 h 6 h. 12 h, 24 h) and the seeding concentration (1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6)cells/ml) of cells onto biomaterials. the results of the study demonstrated that the time interval between seeding osteoblasts and adding culture medium as well as the seeding concentration effects the cell proliferation and the cell colonization. the best proliferation rate was achieved by adding the culture medium 2 h after initial seeding and with a seeding density of 1 x 10(5) cells/ml. moreover, all three biomaterials resulted in different proliferation rates. the best proliferation rate resulted with the bovine collagen membrane. in conclusion, the examined parameters are very important for the development of the tissue engineering techniques and in a larger perspective also for reconstructive surgery.
binge-eating is considered a specific form of overeating characterized by intermittent and high caloric food intake in a short period of time. epidemiologic studies support a positive relation between the ingestion of fat and ethanol (etoh), specifically among adolescent subjects. the aim of this work was to clarify the role of the compulsive, limited and intermittent intake of a high-fat food during adolescence on the rewarding effects of etoh. after binge-eating for 2 h, three days a week from postnatal day (pnd) 29, the reinforcing effects of etoh were tested with etoh self-administration (sa), conditioned place preference (cpp) and ethanol locomotor sensitization procedures in young adult mice. animals in the high fat binge (hfb) group that underwent the etoh sa procedure presented greater etoh consumption and a higher motivation to obtain the drug. hfb mice also developed preference for the paired compartment in the cpp with a subthreshold dose of etoh. independently of the diet, mice developed etoh-induced locomotor sensitization. after the sa procedure, hfb mice exhibited reduced levels of the mu opioid receptor (mor) and increased cannabinoid 1 receptor (cb1r) gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (n acc), and decreased of tyrosine hydroxylase (th) gene expression in the ventral tegmental area (vta). taken together the results suggest that bingeing on fat may represent a vulnerability factor to an escalation of etoh consumption. restricting access to high-fat foods is a common strategy utilized to promote health. this strategy may contribute to episodes of overconsumption, however, when the restricted foods subsequently become available. the present study utilized a rat feeding procedure to determine if restricting access to an optional source of dietary fat would increase later consumption of that food under nonenergy-deprived conditions. five groups of male sprague-dawley rats were used, all of which had continuous access to a standard rodent diet and water. the control group had no access to shortening. the low-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening every day. the high-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening on monday, wednesday, and friday. two additional groups were switched between the high and low conditions. two-hour and 24-h food intakes were measured every day for 6 weeks. at the end of the study rats were sacrificed and carcass composition determined. as access to the shortening decreased, consumption during the 2-h access period increased. rats compensated for the increased shortening consumption by decreasing intake of the standard diet. thus, cumulative energy consumption did not differ among the groups. when switched between the high and low conditions, rats rapidly adjusted to the change in shortening availability. there were no effects of access schedule on carcass composition. these results indicate that restricting access to an optional high-fat food, even under nonenergy-deprived conditions, can promote significant increases in the consumption of that food when it subsequently becomes available.
consider a system of language equations of the form xi=φi(x1,…,xn)(1⩽i⩽n), where every φi may contain the operations of concatenation and complementation. these systems have been studied in “language equations with complementation: decision problems” [a. okhotin, o. yakimova, theoretical computer science 376 (2007) 112–126]. this paper investigates the family of languages representable by unique solutions of such systems. a method for proving nonrepresentability of particular languages is developed. several natural subfamilies of this family are compared to each other and to the main known families of formal languages. their position in the hierarchy is established. it is known that for a regular language l and an arbitrary language k the largest solution of the inequality xk⊆lx is regular. here we show that there exist finite languages k and p and star-free languages l, m and r such that the largest solutions of the systems $\{xk\subseteq lx,\ x\subseteq m\}$ and $\{xk\subseteq lx,\ xp\subseteq rx\}$ are not recursively enumerable.
abstract a viability quantitative pcr (v-qpcr) assay was developed for the unambiguous detection and quantification of lactobacillus plantarum pm411 viable cells in aerial plant surfaces. a 972-bp region of a pm411 predicted prophage with mosaic architecture enabled the identification of a pm411 strain-specific molecular marker. three primer sets with different amplicon lengths (92, 188, and 317 bp) and one taqman probe were designed. all the qpcr assays showed good linearity over a 4-log range and good efficiencies but differed in sensitivity. the nucleic acid-binding dye pemax was used to selectively detect and enumerate viable bacteria by v-qpcr. the primer set amplifying a 188-bp dna fragment was selected as the most suitable for v-qpcr. the performance of the method was assessed on apple blossoms, pear, strawberry, and kiwifruit leaves in potted plants under controlled environmental conditions, as well as pear and apple blossoms under field conditions, by comparing v-qpcr population estimations to those obtained by qpcr and specific plate counting on de man-rogosa-sharpe (mrs)-rifampin. the population estimation did not differ significantly between methods when conditions were conducive to bacterial survival. however, under stressful conditions, differences between methods were observed due to cell death or viable-but-nonculturable state induction. while qpcr overestimated the population level, plate counting underestimated this value in comparison to v-qpcr. pm411 attained stable population levels of viable cells on the flower environment under high relative humidity. however, the unfavorable conditions on the leaf surface and the relatively dryness in the field caused an important decrease in the viable population. importance the v-qpcr method in combination with plate counting and qpcr is a powerful tool for studies of colonization and survival under field conditions, to improve formulations and delivery strategies of pm411, and to optimize the dose and timing of spray schedules. it is expected that pemax v-qpcr could also be developed for monitoring other strains on plant surfaces not only as biological control agents but also beneficial bacteria useful in the sustainable management of crop production. biological control agents (bcas) play an important role in crop protection. they can improve sustainability, prevent resistance to fungicides in target pathogens and reduce fungicide residues on produce. bacillus subtilis strain qst713 (serenade max; bayer cropscience, leverkusen, germany) and bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strain d747 [amylo-x; cbc europe s.r.l.—biogard division, nova milanese (mb), italy] are two commercially available bcas that are used against grey mould on table grape and other crops. taqman-based quantitative (q)pcr assays were developed and validated for quantitative and specific detection of the two bcas on grape bunches following field sprays. specific molecular markers were developed for each bca, and taqman probes were designed and tested in qpcr on dna extracted from washing water of grape berries. the assay proved specific and sensitive for both bcas allowing detection at density as low as three colony-forming units (cfu) per gram of berries. the method will be useful to investigate the population dynamics of the two bcas following their applications in vineyards.
background human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (hiv-1 rt) is a dna polymerase that converts viral rna genomes into proviral dnas. how hiv-1 rt regulates nucleotide selectivity is a central issue for genetics and the nucleoside analog rt inhibitor (nrti) resistance of hiv-1. methodology/principal findings here we show that an atp molecule at physiological concentrations acts as an allosteric regulator of hiv-1 rt to decrease the km value of the substrate, decrease the kcat value, and increase the ki value of nrtis for rt. computer-assisted structural analyses and mutagenesis studies suggested the positions of the atp molecule and nrti-resistance mutations during a catalytic reaction, which immediately predict possible influences on nucleotide insertion into the catalytic site, the dna polymerization, and the excision reaction. conclusions/significance these data imply that the atp molecule and nrti mutations can modulate nucleotide selectivity by altering the fidelity of the geometric selection of nucleotides and the probability of an excision reaction. 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (erythro) and its threo isomer were synthesized and investigated for their inhibition of hiv reverse transcriptase from virus isolate u 937/htlv-iii. the erythro isomer was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction directed by (ra)n(dt)12-18 and the ki value was 0.0022 microm. the threo isomer was at least 100-fold less active. the inhibition was specific for dtmp incorporation, and dgmp incorporation using (rc)n(dg)12-18 as template/primer was not affected. the km value for dttp varied between 0.7 microm and 1.7 microm. reverse transcriptase from nine hiv isolates were tested for inhibition by the erythro isomer and only slight differences in sensitivity were observed.
aim: computed tomography angiography (cta) using three-dimensional (3d) virtual reconstruction has been increasingly used in planning deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) breast reconstruction. although the most common complication associated with this surgery is diffuse venous congestion, its origin remains unclear. the aim of this study was to assess the anatomical characteristics of the anterior abdominal wall vessels that could predict venous congestion, using cta with 3d virtual reconstruction. methods: a retrospective case-control study was conducted and a total of 169 diep flaps were reviewed. an abdominal cta with 3d virtual reconstruction was analyzed with regard to anatomical features of the abdominal wall vessels. seven venous congestive cases were identified. for each case, 3 controls that had not exhibited any vascular complications were randomly selected. results: the global venous congestion rate was 4.14%. no statistically significant differences were found between the groups’ superficial inferior epigastric vein (siev) diameter (p = 0.915), number of branches of siev (p = 0.371), number of perforators per flap (p = 0.255), flap subcutaneous tissue thickness (p = 0.652), direct communications between siev-perforators (p = 0.418), and communications of both sievs across the abdominal midline (p = 0.371). conclusion: the present study provided abstract background: despite improving outcomes, venous problems in the harvest of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) flaps remain the more common vascular complications. however, it is apparent that the venous anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall has not been described to the same extent as the arterial anatomy. previous anatomical studies have focused on cadaveric anatomy or excisional specimens. the current study uses in vivo computed tomographic angiography to evaluate this anatomy, in combination with a cadaveric radiographic study. methods: both cadaveric and in vivo studies were undertaken using eight whole fresh cadaveric specimens (16 sides) and 100 patients undergoing diep flap breast reconstruction (200 sides). the cadaveric component used direct catheter venography and the in vivo studies were undertaken using preoperative computed tomographic angiography, mapping in vivo venous flow. results: the location, caliber, course, and distribution of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric veins were recorded. the dominance of each system and their direction of drainage were described. mechanisms for poor venous drainage were postulated, including perforator size, midline crossover of the superficial inferior epigastric vein, and the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vein communications. the incidence of each of these anatomical factors was evaluated. conclusion: the cause of venous compromise is multifactorial, with the current study showing that preoperative computed tomographic angiography may predict venous problems during flap harvest, by demonstrating perforator diameter, midline crossover, and deep-superficial venous communications.
introduction: the aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome (cts) and to highlight the ultrasonographic cross‐sectional area (csa) ratio as a tool for assessing outcomes by investigating postoperative changes. methods: twenty‐four individuals with cts were evaluated using the boston questionnaire, nerve conduction studies, and ultrasound, preoperatively and at 3 weeks and 3 months postoperatively. results: improved symptom scores, decreased csa, and decreased csa ratio were observed in the first 3 weeks, but functional improvement was also observed after 3 weeks postoperatively. the ratios between the csa at the sites of enlargement and unaffected areas correlated significantly with the padua classification, although the coefficient was not superior to the coefficient of csa at the maximal swelling site. conclusions: symptoms improved more rapidly than function after surgery. measurement of the ultrasonographic csa ratio may provide clinicians with a useful assessment tool after surgery. muscle nerve, 2012 patients (n = 3336) who had been tested for suspected carpal tunnel syndrome (cts) were contacted by postal questionnaire and their opinions sought of the overall subjective outcome of any treatments using a five‐point rating scale. operative results were compared with preoperative nerve conduction, clinical and demographic variables, and a multiple logistic regression analysis used to identify significant prognostic factors. among 1268 surgical procedures that were identified, the overall surgical success rate was 69%. preoperative nerve conduction study findings, greater age, lower symptom scores, longer disease duration, and male gender were significant predictors of poor outcome. nerve conduction studies had the strongest effect, with patients with middle‐grade abnormalities having better results than those with either very severe or no abnormality. surgical carpal tunnel decompression has a significant failure rate. the preoperative nerve conduction studies account for a proportion of the total variation in outcome. © 2001 john wiley & sons, inc. mucle nerve 24: 935–940, 2001
background staphylococcus aureus causes a variety of severe infections such as bacteremia and sepsis. at present, 60–80% of s. aureus isolates from taiwan are methicillin resistant (mrsa). it has been shown that certain mrsa clones circulate worldwide. the goals of this study were to identify mrsa clones in taiwan and to correlate the molecular types of isolates with their phenotypes. methods a total of 157 mrsa isolates from bacteremic patients were collected from nine medical centers. they were typed based on polymorphisms in agr, sccmec, mlst, spa, and dru. phenotypes characterized included panton-valentine leucocidin (pvl), inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance (mlsbi), vancomycin (va) and daptomycin (dap) minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), and superantigenic toxin gene profiles. difference between two consecutive samples was determined by mann-whitney-u test, and difference between two categorical variables was determined by fisher's exact test. results four major mrsa clone complexes cc1, cc5, cc8, and cc59 were found, including 4 cc1, 9 cc5, 111 cc8, and 28 cc59 isolates. these clones had the following molecular types: cc1: sccmeciv and st573; cc5: sccmecii and st5; cc8: sccmeciii, st239, and st241, and cc59: sccmeciv, sccmecvt, st59, and st338. the toxin gene profiles of these clones were cc1: sec-seg-(sei)-sell-selm-(seln)-selo; cc5: sec-seg-sei-sell-selm-(seln)-selp-tst1; cc8: sea-selk-selq, and cc59: seb-selk-selq. most isolates with sccmecvt, st59, spat437, and dru11 types were pvl + (13 isolates), while multidrug resistance (≥4 antimicrobials) were associated with sccmeciii, st239, spa t037, agri, and dru14 (119 isolates) (p<0.001). one hundred and twenty four isolates with the following molecular types had higher va mic: sccmecii and sccmeciii; st5, st239, and st241; spa t002, t037, and t421; dru4, dru10, dru12, dru13, and dru14 (p<0.05). no particular molecular types were found to be associated with mlsbi phenotype. conclusions four major mrsa clone complexes were found in taiwan. further studies are needed to delineate the evolution of mrsa isolates. abstract clonal complex 59 (cc59) community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa) strains were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, diagnostic dna microarrays, and pcrs targeting staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) elements and panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl). six distinct groups within cc59 were characterized. at least seven different variants of sccmec elements were identified (iva [2b], ivb [2b], ivd [2b], iv variant [2b], iva [2b&5], v variant [5c2], and v [5c2&5]). (the structural type is indicated by a roman numeral, with a lowercase letter indicating the subtype, and the ccr complex and the mec complex are indicated by an arabic numeral and an uppercase letter, respectively. where there is an extra ccr element, this is indicated by “&” and an arabic numeral designating the ccr type.) the first group is similar to the american sequence type 59 (st59) mrsa-iv ca-mrsa strain usa1000. the second group includes a pvl-negative st87 strain with an sccmec element of subtype ivb (2b). the third group comprises pvl-variable st59 mrsa-iv strains harboring multiple sccmec iv subtypes. pvl-negative st59 mrsa strains with multiple or composite sccmec elements (iva [2b&5]) form the fourth group. group 5 corresponds to the internationally known “taiwan clone,” a pvl-positive strain with a variant sccmec element (v [5c2&5]). this strain proved to be the most common cc59 mrsa strain isolated in western australia. finally, group 6 encompasses the st59 mrsa-v variant (5c2). the differentiation of cc59 into groups and strains indicates a rapid evolution and spread of sccmec elements. observed differences between groups of strains as well as intrastrain variability within a group facilitate the tracing of their spread.
abstractthis study was designed to examine immunological responses to an acute bout of cycle ergometry exercise before and after moderate endurance training. previously sedentary males were randomly assigned to matched training (n=9) or control (n=6) groups. training comprised 12 weeks during which supervised cycle ergometer exercise took place [30 min at 65–70% of maximal oxygen intake $$(\dot vo_{2max} )$$ , 4–5 days · week−1]. an acute bout of exercise (60 min; 60% $$\dot vo_{2max} $$  was performed initially and after the 12-week interval. samples of peripheral venous blood were taken at rest, after 30 and 60 min of exercise, and at 30 and 120 min post-exercise. training improved $$\dot vo_{2max} $$  by an average of 20% (40.6 to 49.2 ml · kg−1 · min−1). relative to baseline and control measures, the resting concentration of (cd3-cd16+/cd56+) natural killer (nk) cells increased by 22% (p<0.05). the resting count of total cd25+ [interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r) α chain] lymphocytes did not change following training, but dual staining analysis showed a 100% increase in the fraction of cd16+ cd25+ nk cells (p < 0.05). likewise the resting cd122+ (il-2rβ chain) lymphocyte count increased 35% after training, the greatest increases (44%) being in cd16+ cd122+ nk cells (p<0.05). soluble il-2r levels also increased 33% (p< 0.05) after training. following acute exercise at the same relative intensity; trained individuals exhibited a larger increase in the nk cell count, reduced lymphocytopenia, and attenuation of exercise-induced suppression of lymphocyte proliferation and il-2 production (p<0.05). in addition, smaller increases in cd4 and cd8 counts during exercise were noted, but with faster recovery post-exercise (p<0.05). addition of recombinant il-2 (ril-2) to phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures did not reverse exercise-induced suppression of cell proliferation, either before or after training. however, ril-2 did augment the spontaneous blastogenesis of exercise and post-training samples relative to baseline (p < 0.05). we conclude that moderate endurance training is associated with sustained alterations in immune function, both at rest and when exercising. further investigations are necessary to determine the impact on overall health and susceptibility to disease. this study was designed to examine cytokine production in a group of 22 well-trained runners covering a distance of 20 km within 2 hr. after running, all participants displayed a marked granulocytosis for 7 hr. plasma neopterin levels increased 1 hr after exercise for 24 hr. except for interleukin-6 (il-6), cytokines were not reliably detected in plasma but were present in urine. already before exercise, cytokines were detected in the urine of runners when compared to sedentary controls. directly after running, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were further elevated but rapidly declined to preexercise levels. interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 increased at a slower rate after exercise but secretion into urine persisted longer until 12 and 7 hr, respectively. interleukin-2 (il-2) was not detected but soluble il-2 receptors appeared in the urine directly after running. enhanced cytokine levels were accompanied by an only low creatinin kinase increase, indicating little muscle damage. these data show that long-distance running elevates cytokine production which supports the concept that regular, but not excessive, physical exercise may be beneficial by maintaining a stimulated immune system.
short telomeres are thought to trigger senescence, most likely through a single – or a group of few – critically shortened telomeres. such short telomeres are thought to result from a combination of gradual linear shortening resulting from the end replication problem, reflecting the division history of the cell, superimposed by a more stochastic mechanism, suddenly causing a significant shortening of a single telomere. previously, studies that have tried to explore the role of critically shortened telomeres have been hampered by methodological problems. with the method presented here, universal stela, we have a tool that can directly investigate the relationship between senescence and the load of short telomeres. the method is a variant of the chromosome‐specific stela method but has the advantage that it can demonstrate short telomeres regardless of chromosome. with universal stela, we find a strong correlation between the load of short telomeres and cellular senescence. further we show that the load of short telomeres is higher in senescent cells compared to proliferating cells at the same passage, offering an explanation of premature cell senescence. this new method, universal stela, offers some advantages compared to existing methods and can be used to explore many of the unanswered questions in telomere biology including the role that telomeres play in cancer and aging. human diploid fibroblast cells cease growth in culture after a finite number of population doublings. to address the cause of growth cessation in senescent imr-90 human fibroblast cells, we determined the level of oxidative dna damage by using 8-oxoguanine excised from dna and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in dna as markers. senescent cells excise from dna four times more 8-oxoguanine per day than do early-passage young cells. the steady-state level of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in dna is approximately 35% higher in senescent cells than in young cells. measurement of protein carbonyls shows that senescent cells did not appear to have elevated protein oxidation. to reduce the level of oxidative damage, we cultured cells under a more physiological o2 concentration (3%) and compared the replicative life span to the cells cultured at the o2 concentration of air (20%). we found that cells grown under 3% o2 achieved 50% more population doublings during their lifetime. such an extension of life span resulted from the delayed onset of senescence and elevation of growth rate and saturation density of cells at all passages. the spin-trapping agent alpha-phenyl-t-butyl nitrone (pbn), which can act as an antioxidant, also effectively delayed senescence and rejuvenated near senescent cells. the effect is dose-dependent and is most pronounced for cells at the stage just before entry into senescence. our data support the hypothesis that oxidative dna damage contributes to replicative cessation in human diploid fibroblast cells.
body mass index (bmi) is often used as a surrogate estimate of percent body fat in epidemiological studies. this study tested the hypothesis that bmi is representative of body fatness independent of age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic location in prepubertal children. the study sample included a total of 605 prepubertal children (275 girls and 330 boys) of which 247 were chinese from jinan, shandong, mainland china, and 358 children were from various ethnic backgrounds in new york city (nyc): 121 caucasians, 94 african americans, and 143 asians (chinese and korean). in this cross-sectional study, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to quantify total body fat (tbf) and percent body fat (pbf). prepubertal status was assessed by the criteria of tanner. multiple regression models were developed with tbf and pbf as the dependent variables and bmi, age, sex, and ethnicity as independent variables. multiple regression analysis showed that bmi alone explained 85% and 69% of between-subject variance for tbf and pbf, respectively. sex was a significant contributor to the models (p<0.001) with girls having higher tbf and pbf than boys. ethnicity and geographic location were significant contributors to the model (p<0.0001) with asians (jinan and nyc asians) having higher pbf than all non-asian groups (p<0.0001), and jinan asians having higher tbf and pbf than nyc-asians. among prepubertal children, for the same bmi, asians have significantly higher pbf compared with african americans and caucasians. caution is warranted when applying bmi across sex and ethnic prepubertal groups. objectives to test the hypothesis that in a healthy pediatric population body mass index (bmi) (kilograms per meter square) is a valid measure of fatness that is independent of age for both sexes.   methods total body fat (tbf) (in kilograms) and percent of body weight as fat (pbf) were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) in 198 healthy italian children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age. we developed multiple regression analysis models with tbf and percent body fat as dependent variables and bmi, age, and interaction terms as independent variables. separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls.   results bmi was strongly associated with tbf (r2 = 0.85 and 0.89 for boys and girls, respectively) and pbf (r2 =0.63 and 0.69 for boys and girls, respectively). confidence limits on bmi-fatness association were wide, with individuals of similar bmi showing large differences in tbf and in pbf. age was a significant covariate in all regression models. addition of nonlinear terms for bmi did not substantially increase the r2 for tbf and pbf models in boys and girls.   conclusion our results support the use of bmi as a fatness measure in groups of children and adolescents, although interpretation should be cautious when comparing bmi across groups that differ in age or when predicting a specific individual's tbf or pbf.
training and testing of balance have potential applications in sports and medicine. laboratory grade force plates (fp) are considered the gold standard for the measurement of balance performance. measurements in these systems are based on the parameterization of center of pressure (cop) trajectories. previous research validated the inexpensive, widely available and portable nintendo wii balance board (wbb). the novelty of the present study is that fp and wbb are compared on cop data that was collected simultaneously, by placing the wbb on the fp. fourteen healthy participants performed ten sequences of single-leg stance tasks with eyes open (eo), eyes closed (ec) and after a sideways hop (hop). within trial comparison of the two systems showed small root-mean-square differences for the cop trajectories in the x and y direction during the three tasks (mean±sd; eo: 0.33±0.10 and 0.31±0.16 mm; ec: 0.58±0.17 and 0.63±0.19 mm; hop: 0.74±0.34 and 0.74±0.27 mm, respectively). additionally, during all 420 trials, comparison of fp and wbb revealed very high pearson's correlation coefficients (r) of the cop trajectories (x: 0.999±0.002; y: 0.998±0.003). a general overestimation was found on the wbb compared to the fp for 'cop path velocity' (eo: 5.3±1.9%; ec: 4.0±1.4%; hop: 4.6±1.6%) and 'mean absolute cop sway' (eo: 3.5±0.7%; ec: 3.7±0.5%; hop: 3.6±1.0%). this overestimation was highly consistent over the 140 trials per task (r>0.996). the present findings demonstrate that wbb is sufficiently accurate in quantifying cop trajectory, and overall amplitude and velocity during single-leg stance balance tasks. biomedical sciences rely heavily on devices to acquire and analyze the physiological data needed to understand and model the biological processes of humans and animals. therefore, the results of the investigations, clinical or academic, depend heavily on the instrumentation used. unfortunately, all too often the users do not understand their instruments and end up compromising the results of their investigations by choosing an inadequate instrument or by not using it appropriately. one field where this is particularly apparent is posturography: the misconceptions about instruments are so widespread and deep that just recently there have been articles published in scientific journals suggesting the use of a toy, the nintendo wii balance board, instead of instrument grade force platform to acquire posturographic data. characterizing the tools used for research becomes the first and probably the most important step in producing sound research and clinical results, and in the case of posturographic force platforms and the nintendo wii balance board a simple experimental setup can be used to find their characteristics. furthermore, based on the preliminary results of this investigation, a mathematical formula can be used to predict the behavior of a posturographic tool, once its noise characteristics and dead weight response are known.
previous studies have reported alterations of cytokine and cytokine-receptor concentrations in psychiatric patient populations, including patients with major depressive disorder (mdd). however, study results are conflicting, and possible causes for these abnormalities are unknown. since sleep deprivation may induce a rapid improvement of mood in depressed patients, the authors investigated the impact of total sleep deprivation (tsd) for one night, and subsequent recovery sleep, on nocturnal concentrations of interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-1-receptor antagonist (il-1ra), and soluble il-2 receptor (sil-2r) in 15 unmedicated patients with mdd and 16 healthy volunteers. whereas il-6 levels normalized again during the recovery night in depressed patients, they were still elevated in control subjects. serum levels of il-1ra were higher in depressed patients than in controls, but were not affected by tsd. during recovery sleep, il-1ra levels increased as compared with the preceding tsd night only in controls. responders (n=8) differed from nonresponders (n=7) to tsd with regard to il-1ra, which increased significantly during tsd in responders only. sleep deprivation therefore seems to significantly affect cytokine levels in both depressed patients and healthy subjects, but does so in different ways. sleep disturbances in depressed patients could account for the increased levels of cytokines found in these patients in several previous studies. the interaction between antidepressant effects of tsd and alterations of cytokines warrants further investigation. objective one night of sleep deprivation induces a transient improvement in about 60% of depressed patients. since depression is associated with abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, the authors measured cortisol secretion before, during, and after therapeutic sleep deprivation for 1 night.   method fifteen unmedicated depressed inpatients participated in a combined polysomnographic and endocrine study. blood was sampled at 30-minute intervals during 3 consecutive nights before, during, and after sleep deprivation. saliva samples were collected at 30-minute intervals during the daytime before and after the sleep deprivation night.   results during the night of sleep deprivation, cortisol levels were significantly higher than at baseline. during the daytime, cortisol levels during the first half of the day were higher than at baseline in the patients who responded to sleep deprivation but not in the nonresponders. during recovery sleep, cortisol secretion returned to baseline values.   conclusions this study demonstrated a significant stimulatory effect of 1 night of sleep deprivation on the hpa axis in unmedicated depressed patients. the results suggest that the short-term effects of antidepressant treatments on the hpa axis may differ from their long-term effects. a higher cortisol level after sleep deprivation might transiently improve negative feedback to the hypothalamus or interact with other neurotransmitter systems, thus mediating or contributing to the clinical response. the fast return to baseline values coincides with the short clinical effect.
background colonization by aspergillus fumigatus in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) can cause a fumigatus sensitization and/or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa), which affects pulmonary function and clinical outcomes. recent studies show that specific allergens upregulate the surface-expressed basophil marker cd203c in sensitized subjects, a response that can be readily measured by using flow cytometry.   objective we sought to identify a fumigatus sensitization in patients with cf by using the basophil activation test (bat).   methods patients with cf attending beaumont hospital were screened for study inclusion. bat was used to identify a fumigatus sensitization. serologic (total and a fumigatus-specific ige), pulmonary function, and body mass index measurements were performed.   results the bat discriminates a fumigatus-sensitized from nonsensitized patients with cf. persistent isolation of a fumigatus in sputum is a significant risk factor for a fumigatus sensitization. levels of the a fumigatus-stimulated basophil activation marker cd203c inversely correlated with pulmonary function and body mass index in a fumigatus-sensitized but not nonsensitized patients with cf. total and a fumigatus-specific ige, but not igg, levels are increased in a fumigatus-sensitized patients with cf and abpa when compared with those in a fumigatus-sensitized and nonsensitized patients with cf without abpa. itraconazole treatment did not affect a fumigatus sensitization.   conclusion combining the bat with routine serologic testing allows classification of patients with cf into 3 groups: nonsensitized, a fumigatus-sensitized, and abpa. accurate and prompt identification of a fumigatus-associated clinical status might allow early and targeted therapeutic intervention, potentially improving clinical outcomes. background cystic fibrosis (cf) is the most common life threatening autosomal recessive disorder in the white population. wasting has long been recognised as a poor prognostic marker in cf. whether it predicts survival independently of lung function and arterial blood gas tensions has not previously been reported. methods 584 patients with cf (261 women) of mean (sd) age 21 (7) years were studied between 1985 and 1996, all of whom were being followed up in a tertiary referral centre. lung function tests, body weight, arterial blood oxygen (pao 2) and carbon dioxide (paco 2) tensions were measured. the weight was calculated as a percentage of the ideal body weight for age, height, and sex. results forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) recorded at the start of the study was 1.8 (1.0) l (52 (26)% predicted fev1), pao 2 9.8 (1.9) kpa, paco 2 5.0 (0.9) kpa, and % ideal weight 92 (18)%. during the follow up period (45 (27) months) 137 patients died (5 year survival 72%, 95% ci 67 to 73). fev1, % predicted fev1, pao 2, % ideal weight (all p<0.0001), and paco 2 (p=0.04) predicted survival. in multivariate analysis, % predicted fev1 (p<0.0001), % ideal weight (p=0.004), and paco 2 (p=0.02) were independent predictors of outcome. patients with >85% ideal body weight had a better prognosis at 5 years (cumulative survival 84%, 95% ci 79 to 89) than those with ⩽85% ideal weight (survival 53%, 95% ci 45 to 62), p<0.0001. percentage predicted fev1 (area under curve 0.83; 95% ci 0.78 to 0.87) and % ideal weight (area under curve 0.74; 95% ci 0.68 to 0.79) were accurate predictors of survival at 5 years follow up (receiver-operating characteristic analysis). conclusions body wasting is a significant predictor of survival in patients with cf independent of lung function, arterial blood oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions.
backgroundthe burden caused by the coexistence of obesity and underweight in low and middle income countries is a challenge to public health. while prevalence of underweight among youth has been well documented in these countries, overweight, obesity and their associated risk factors are not well understood unlike in high income countries.methodscross-sectional data from the global school-based student health survey (gshs) conducted in seven african countries were used for this study. the survey used a clustered design to obtain a representative sample (n = 23496) from randomly selected schools. 53.6% of the sample was male, and participants ranged in age from 11-17 years old. body mass index (bmi) was calculated using age and sex adjusted self-reported heights and weights. classification of weight status was based on the 2007 world health organization growth charts (bmi-for-age and sex). multivariable logistic regression reporting odds ratios was used to assess potential risk factors on bmi, adjusting for age, sex, and country. statistical analyses were performed with stata with an alpha of 0.05 and reporting 95% confidence intervals.resultsunadjusted rates of being underweight varied from 12.6% (egypt) to 31.9% (djibouti), while being overweight ranged from 8.7% (ghana) to 31.4% (egypt). obesity rates ranged from 0.6% (benin) to 9.3% (egypt). females had a higher overweight prevalence for every age group in five of the countries, exceptions being egypt and malawi. overall, being overweight was more prevalent among younger (≤12) adolescents and decreased with age. males had a higher prevalence of being underweight than females for every country. there was a tendency for the prevalence of being underweight to increase starting in the early teens and decrease between ages 15 and 16. most of the potential risk factors captured by the gshs were not significantly associated with weight status.conclusionsthe prevalence of both overweight and underweight was relatively high, demonstrating the existence of the double burden of malnutrition among adolescents in developing countries. several factors were not associated with weight status suggesting the need to explore other potential risk factors for overweight and underweight, including genetic factors and socioeconomic status. this paper describes the first african experience with the nutrition-friendly school initiative (nfsi) in two large west african cities: ouagadougou, burkina faso and cotonou, benin. nfsi was launched by the world health organization (who) and its partners in 2006, as a means of preventing the double burden of malnutrition: the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition among school-children. nfsi pilot-testing is one component of the partnership project on the double burden of malnutrition, funded by the canadian international development agency for 6 years (2008–2014). the project assisted the government in the selection of pilot schools, fostered the installation of health and nutrition committees in selected schools, and helped with the initial school self-assessments. in accordance with the empowering philosophy of health promotion, pilot schools did not follow a pre-defined schedule of interventions, except for the training of teachers in nutrition education and the nutritional (anthropometric) surveillance of schoolchildren. for the latter activities, technical assistance and seminal funds were provided. yearly planning workshops were held for school committees, with who support. in both settings, training was given to street vendors in order to improve the hygiene and nutritional value of food sold to schoolchildren. other activities included special nutrition events and sanitation measures. in both cities, nfsi showed promising results in terms of school and community mobilization towards improved nutrition and health; however, nfsi must be better understood as an endogenous and self-sustaining approach. furthermore, household poverty and scarce school resources appear as major barriers to gaining full impact of nfsi in low-income populations.

cln5 is a soluble lysosomal protein with unknown function. mutations in cln5 lead to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders that mainly affect children. cln5 has eight potential n-glycosylation sites based on the asn-x-thr/ser consensus sequence. through site-directed mutagenesis of individual asparagine residues to glutamine on each of the n-glycosylation consensus sites, we showed that all eight putative n-glycosylation sites are utilized in vivo. additionally, localization studies showed that the lack of n-glycosylation on certain sites (n179, n252, n304, or n320) caused cln5 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that glycosylation is important for protein folding. interestingly, one particular mutant, n401q, is mislocalized to the golgi, suggesting that n401 is not important for protein folding but essential for cln5 trafficking to the lysosome. finally, we analyzed several patient mutations in which n-glycosylation is affected. the n192s patient mutant is localized to the lysosome, indicating that this mutant has a functional defect in the lysosome. our results suggest that there are functional differences in various n-glycosylation sites of cln5 which affect folding, trafficking, and lysosomal function of cln5. neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ncls) represent a group of children's inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in at least eight different genes. mutations in the cln5 gene result in the finnish variant late infantile ncl characterized by gradual loss of vision, epileptic seizures, and mental deterioration. the cln5 gene encodes a lysosomal glycoprotein of unidentified function. in this study, we have used both transient and stable expression systems for the characterization of cln5, focusing on the localization, processing, and intracellular trafficking. we show that cln5 is proteolytically cleaved, and that the mature polypeptide is transported to the lysosomes. our data provide the first evidence that soluble cln5 protein can also undergo mannose‐6‐phosphate receptor‐independent trafficking to the lysosomes. we studied the localization and maturation of the cln5 carrying the previously uncharacterized vlincl disease causing mutations in hela cells. all analyzed disease mutations disturb the lysosomal trafficking of the mutated cln5 proteins. the level of lysosomal targeting does not correlate, however, to disease onset, indicating that cln5 may also function outside lysosomes. this study furthers our understanding of the basic properties of the cln5 protein, necessary for the characterization of the consequences of disease mutations and for the planning of future therapies for vlincl. hum mutat 31:356–365, 2010. © 2010 wiley‐liss, inc.
few studies have examined both episodic and semantic autobiographical memory (am) performance during late childhood and early adolescence. using the newly developed children’s autobiographical interview (cai), the present study examined the effects of age and sex on episodic and semantic am and everyday memory in 182 children and adolescents. results indicated that episodic and semantic am both improved between 8 and 16 years of age; however, age-related changes were larger for episodic am than for semantic am. in addition, females were found to recall more episodic am details, but not more semantic am details, than males. importantly, this sex difference in episodic am recall was attenuated under conditions of high retrieval support (i.e., the use of probing questions). the ability to clearly visualize past events at the time of recollection was related to children’s episodic am recall performance, particularly the retrieval of perceptual details. finally, similar age and sex effects were found between episodic am and everyday memory ability (e.g., memory for everyday activities). more specifically, older participants and females exhibited better episodic am and everyday memory performance than younger participants and males. overall, the present study provides important new insight into both episodic and semantic am performance, as well as the relation between episodic am and everyday memory, during late childhood and adolescence. *department of neurophysiology, institute of physiology, medical faculty, ruhr-universitlt bochum, universitiitsstr. 150, d-4630 bochum 1, f.r.g. sdepartment of functional neuroanatomy, institute of experimental medicine, hungarian academy of sciences, p.o. box 67. h-1450 budapest, hungary, and mrc anatomical neuropharmacology unit, _ department of pha-rmacology, university of oxford, oxford, u.k.
models are a useful tool to increase the developer’s productivity and satisfaction when performing maintenance tasks. however, in order to maximise these advantages, the right selection of notations must be made. unfortunately, the software engineering field lacks a body of empirical evidence that supports such selection. a suboptimal decision in this regard may have negative consequences over the maintenance process. the aim of the study was to compare a textual and a graphical notation with respect to the efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction of junior software developers while performing analysability and modifiability tasks on two different applications. we have carried out a quasi-experiment with 86 third-year students of the computer engineering degree at the university of alicante. subjects were randomly classified into two groups, and each group performed 20 maintenance tasks with a textual and a graphical notation. we measured and compared the efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction of subjects assigned to each treatment. the analysed data show that only the actual analysability coverage (aacov) and the actual modifiability efficiency (ameffc) are affected by the type of notation used, regardless of the application. in both cases, subjects using the textual notation performed significantly better, although the effect size was low to moderate (aacov $$\eta ^2=0.106$$η2=0.106, ameffc $$\eta ^2=0.187$$η2=0.187). this is a pilot study, and it has been conducted to enhance the design of future studies in this area. thus, it should be replicated to extend our conclusions to other subject profiles, different textual and graphical notations, and application types. as modeling becomes a crucial activity in software develop- ment the question may be asked whether currently used graphical repre- sentations are the best option to model systems eciently. this position paper discusses the advantages of text-based modeling over commonly used graphical representations. it is inspired through the advent of new extensible development tools like eclipse. the discussion is illustrated by showing a textual version of uml state machines as eclipse plugins.
purposeto evaluate efficacy and toxicity after salvage brachytherapy (bt) in prostate local recurrence after radiation therapy.methods and materialsbetween 1993 and 2007, we retrospectively analyzed 56 consecutively patients (pts) undergoing salvage brachytherapy. after local biopsy-proven recurrence, pts received 145 gy ldr-bt (37 pts, 66%) or hdr-bt (19 pts, 34%) in different dose levels according to biological equivalent doses (bed2 gy). by the time of salvage bt, only 15 pts (27%) received adt. univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of biochemical control and toxicities. acute and late genitourinary (gu) and gastrointestinal (gi) toxicities were graded using common terminology criteria for adverse events (ctcv3.0).resultsmedian follow-up after salvage bt was 48 months. the 5-year ffbf was 77%. hdr and ldr late grade 3 gu toxicities were observed in 21% and 24%. late grade 3 gi toxicities were observed in 2% (hdr) and 2.7% (ldr). on univariate analysis, pre-salvage prostate-specific antigen (psa) > 10 ng/ml (p = 0.004), interval to relapse after initial treatment < 24 months (p = 0.004) and salvage hdr-bt doses bed2 gy level < 227 gy (p = 0.012) were significant in predicting biochemical failure. on cox multivariate analysis, pre-salvage psa, and time to relapse were significant in predicting biochemical failure.hdr-bt bed2 gy (α/β 1.5 gy) levels ≥ 227 (p = 0.013), and adt (p = 0.049) were significant in predicting grade ≥ 2 urinary toxicity.conclusionsprostate bt is an effective salvage modality in some selected prostate local recurrence patients after radiation therapy. even, we provide some potential predictors of biochemical control and toxicity for prostate salvage bt, further investigation is recommended. purpose we describe the treatment outcome in 17 patients who received combined salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy for local prostate cancer relapse after prior external beam irradiation.   materials and methods median patient age was 68 years. local relapse after external beam irradiation was confirmed by biopsy. median prostate specific antigen at local relapse was 4.7 ng/ml. five of the 17 patients were enrolled in a protocol combining androgen deprivation therapy with brachytherapy and the remaining men were treated off protocol. all patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for a median of 3 months, followed by ultrasound guided brachytherapy using 125i in 9 and 103pd seeds in 8. five patients also received adjuvant leuprolide for a median of 6 months. biochemical failure was defined using the american society for therapeutic radiology and oncology definition. toxicity was graded with a modified radiation therapy oncology group scale.   results median followup was 44 months. the actuarial 4-year biochemical control rate was 75%. three patients died of intercurrent diseases. no prostate cancer mortality or local failure had occurred at last followup. one patient had bone metastasis. no clinical or treatment factor was associated with biochemical control. grade 3 and 4 genitourinary toxicity developed in 7 (41%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively. grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (29%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively.   conclusions our series suggests that salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy can achieve biochemical control in select patients with local relapse after prior external beam irradiation. the major side effects are urinary complications, including grade 3 and 4 complications in 41% and 6% of cases, respectively.
brain ischemia may be causally related with alzheimer's disease. presumably, β-secretase and amyloid-β protein precursor gene expression changes may be associated with alzheimer's disease neuropathology. consequently, we have examined quantitative changes in both β-secretase and amyloid-β protein precursor genes in the medial temporal lobe cortex with the use of quantitative rtpcr analysis following 10-min global brain ischemia in rats with survival of 2, 7, and 30 days. the greatest significant overexpression of β-secretase gene was noted on the 2nd day, while on days 7-30 the expression of this gene was only modestly downregulated. amyloid-β protein precursor gene was downregulated on the 2nd day, but on days 7-30 postischemia, there was a significant reverse tendency. thus, the demonstrated alterations indicate that the considerable changes of expression of β-secretase and amyloid-β protein precursor genes may be connected with a response of neurons in medial temporal lobe cortex to transient global brain ischemia. finally, the ischemia-induced gene changes may play a key role in a late and slow onset of alzheimer-type pathology. there is increasing evidence for influence of alzheimer's proteins and neuropathology on ischemic brain injury. this review investigates the relationships between β‐amyloid peptide, apolipoproteins, presenilins, tau protein, α‐synuclein, inflammation factors, and neuronal survival/death decisions in brain following ischemic episode. the interactions of these molecules and influence on β‐amyloid peptide synthesis and contribution to ischemic brain degeneration and finally to dementia are reviewed. generation and deposition of β‐amyloid peptide and tau protein pathology are important key players involved in mechanisms in ischemic neurodegeneration as well as in alzheimer's disease. current evidence suggests that inflammatory process represents next component, which significantly contribute to degeneration progression. although inflammation was initially thought to arise secondary to ischemic neurodegeneration, recent studies present that inflammatory mediators may stimulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism by upregulation of β‐secretase and therefore are able to establish a vicious cycle. functional brain recovery after ischemic lesion was delayed and incomplete by an injury‐related increase in the amount of the neurotoxic c‐terminal of amyloid precursor protein and β‐amyloid peptide. moreover, ischemic neurodegeneration is strongly accelerated with aging, too. new therapeutic alternatives targeting these proteins and repairing related neuronal changes are under development for the treatment of ischemic brain consequences including memory loss prevention. anat rec, 292:1863–1881, 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
ultraconserved elements (uces) are discrete genomic elements conserved across large evolutionary distances. although uces have been linked to multiple facets of mammalian gene regulation their extreme evolutionary conservation remains largely unexplained. here, we apply a computational approach to investigate this question in drosophila, exploring the molecular functions of more than 1,500 uces shared across the genomes of 12 drosophila species. our data indicate that drosophila uces are hubs for gene regulatory functions and suggest that uce sequence invariance originates from their combinatorial roles in gene control. we also note that the gene regulatory roles of intronic and intergenic uces (iuces) are distinct from those found in exonic uces (euces). in iuces, transcription factor (tf) and epigenetic factor binding data strongly support iuce roles in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. in contrast, analyses of euces indicate that they are two orders of magnitude more likely than the expected to simultaneously include protein-coding sequence, tf-binding sites, splice sites, and rna editing sites but have reduced roles in transcriptional or epigenetic regulation. furthermore, we use a drosophila cell culture system and transgenic drosophila embryos to validate the notion of uce combinatorial regulatory roles using an euce within the hox gene ultrabithorax and show that its protein-coding region also contains alternative splicing regulatory information. taken together our experiments indicate that uces emerge as a result of combinatorial gene regulatory roles and highlight common features in mammalian and insect uces implying that similar processes might underlie ultraconservation in diverse animal taxa. identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. one major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. in this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human–pufferfish, takifugu (fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human–mouse–rat. we tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. while directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. we identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all ∼3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and fugu. the testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. these data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.
retrieval of spermatozoa is unfortunately still only successful in a subset of patients suffering from non‐obstructive azoospermia (noa) by conventional testicular sperm extraction (tese). microdissection tese may have some theoretical benefits over conventional tese, but uncertainty exists about its superiority. the objective of this systematic review was therefore to compare the efficacy and safety of microtese with conventional tese in men with noa. the systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis statement. literature was searched for studies comparing outcome of conventional tese with microdissection tese. primary outcome was sperm retrieval rate (srr). secondary outcomes were clinical predictors of sperm retrieval as well as complication rate. of 62 articles, a total of seven studies were included in the final analysis. overall srr was significantly higher in the microtese group in comparison with conventional tese in five of these studies. overall sperm retrieval ranged from 16.7 to 45% in the conventional tese vs. 42.9 to 63% in the microtese group. a sub‐analysis of the srr according to testicular histology was available in four of the selected articles. microtese in men with sertoli cell only syndrome and hypospermatogenesis carried a small but significant more favourable outcome according to, respectively, two and one of the studies. correlation of serum follicle stimulating hormone and testicular volume with positive outcome was variable. fewer complications were observed on ultrasound examination after microtese procedure. clinical randomized studies comparing microtese with conventional tese in noa are still lacking to date. pseudo‐randomized prospective data, however, show more favourable sperm retrieval in noa for microtese, especially in histological patterns of patchy spermatogenesis such as sertoli cell only syndrome. however, in patients with uniform histological patterns such as maturation arrest outcome of microtese seems less favourable. in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
backgroundillness conditions lead to medical expenditure. even with various types of medical insurance, there can still be considerable out-of-pocket costs. medical expenditure can affect other categories of household consumptions. the goal of this study is to provide an updated empirical description of the distributions of illness conditions and medical expenditure and their associations with other categories of household consumptions.methodsa phone-call survey was conducted in june and july of 2012. the study was approved by ethics review committees at xiamen university and fujen catholic university. data was collected using a computer-assisted telephone survey system (catss). “household” was the unit for data collection and analysis. univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted, examining the distributions of illness conditions and the associations of illness and medical expenditure with other household consumptions.resultsthe presence of chronic disease and inpatient treatment was not significantly associated with household characteristics. the level of per capita medical expenditure was significantly associated with household size, income, and household head occupation. the presence of chronic disease was significantly associated with levels of education, insurance and durable goods consumption. after adjusting for confounders, the associations with education and durable goods consumption remained significant. the presence of inpatient treatment was not associated with consumption levels. in the univariate analysis, medical expenditure was significantly associated with all other consumption categories. after adjusting for confounding effects, the associations between medical expenditure and the actual amount of entertainment expenses and percentages of basic consumption, savings, and insurance (as of total consumption) remained significant.conclusionthis study provided an updated description of the distributions of illness conditions and medical expenditure in taiwan. the findings were mostly positive in that illness and medical expenditure were not observed to be significantly associated with other consumption categories. this observation differed from those made in some other asian countries and could be explained by the higher economic status and universal basic health insurance coverage of taiwan. background the main goal of this study is to examine the associations between illness conditions and out-of-pocket medical expenditure with other types of household consumptions. in november and december of 2011, a survey was conducted in three cities in western china, namely lan zhou, gui lin and xi an, and their surrounding rural areas. results information on demographics, income and consumption was collected on 2,899 households. data analysis suggested that the presence of household members with chronic diseases was not associated with characteristics of households or household heads. the presence of inpatient treatments was significantly associated with the age of household head (p-value 0.03). the level of per capita medical expense was significantly associated with household size, presence of members younger than 18, older than 65, basic health insurance coverage, per capita income, and household head occupation. adjusting for confounding effects, the presence of chronic diseases was negatively associated with the amount of basic consumption (p-value 0.02) and the percentage of basic consumption (p-value 0.01), but positively associated with the percentage of insurance expense (p-value 0.02). medical expenditure was positively associated with all other types of consumptions, including basic, education, saving and investment, entertainment, insurance, durable goods, and alcohol/tobacco. it was negatively associated with the percentage of basic consumption, saving and investment, and insurance. conclusions early studies conducted in other asian countries and rural china found negative associations between illness conditions and medical expenditure with other types of consumptions. this study was conducted in three major cities and surrounding areas in western china, which had not been well investigated in published literature. the observed consumption patterns were different from those in early studies, and the negative associations were not observed. this study may complement the existing rural studies and provide useful information on western chinese cities.
ocular perfusion pressure (opp) is not easily directly measurable, and the difference between blood pressure and intraocular pressure (iop) has been suggested as a simple surrogate of opp. we write in relation to publications in this journal and elsewhere that have reported a significant association between opp surrogates and glaucoma. we argue that these findings are based on incorrect interpretation of multivariable regression models, and that these simple surrogates cannot be used to examine the role of opp in glaucoma. we illustrate this by theoretically reviewing the interpretation of coefficients in multivariable regression models, and then demonstrating the issue using a simulated dataset. interpretation of regression coefficients is straightforward in univariable regression. as an example, consider the setting of a cross-sectional study. a univariable logistic regression model examining whether iop is associated with the prevalence of glaucoma would be as follows: purpose. to assess the distribution of the 24-hour intraocular pressure (iop) in subjects with primary openangle glaucoma (poag) in a population-based study in rural west bengal. methods. all untreated poag patients (n = 132) identified by a door to door survey in the hugli district of west bengal were invited to attend a follow-up study in which iop was tested with a goldmann applanation tonometer at 10 am, 1 pm, 4 pm, 7pm, 10 pm, 1 am, and 6 am. results. 72 subjects with untreated poag (72/132; 88.6%) attended the study. of them, 59 (83.0%) had a peak iop ≤ 21 mm hg. the peak iop (mean ± sd) was 16.4 ± 4.2 mm hg. peak iop occurred in early morning in approximately 78.5% of the subjects (6 am to 10 am), and the trough occurred during night time in 72.2% of the subjects (10 pm to 1 am). the 24-hour iop (mean ± sd) was 14.2 ± 4.4 mm hg and the mean fluctuation was 4.0 ± 6.8 mm hg (range, 2–11 mm hg). in the 32 persons with unilateral glaucoma, no significant differences were found in mean 24-hour iop, peak iop, trough iop, or iop fluctuation when comparing the glaucomatous eye with the non glaucomatous eye (p > 0.05). conclusions. twenty-four–hour iop was similar between glaucomatous and controls (contralateral nonglaucomatous) eyes suggesting that factors other than iop may play a role in the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in these eyes.
sensory processing deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia and can be demonstrated by recording auditory evoked potentials (aeps) elicited in response to closely paired click stimuli. in nonschizophrenic humans, as well as in rats, the amplitude of the response to the second click is reduced (filtered) compared with the first. in contrast, schizophrenics, or rats treated with amphetamine, generate aeps that have smaller amplitudes and show little or no reduction in the response to the second click. we sought to evaluate the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine2 5-ht2 receptors in auditory filtering. male sprague-dawley rats were implanted with a skull screw electrode to permit chronic recording of aeps from a point approximating human vertex. during subsequent recording sessions, pairs of clicks (a conditioning click followed by a test click) were presented 500 msec apart. parameters of n40, a dominant midlatency component of the aep, were examined to evaluate the effects of a 5-ht2 receptor agonist, (6)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (doi), and a 5-ht2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin. systemic administration of ketanserin reduced sensory filtering in a dose-dependent manner. conversely, doi significantly improved filtering. in addition, doi dose-dependently antagonized the disruption of filtering induced by administration of amphetamine (1.83 mg/kg i.p.). taken together, these results indicate an important role for 5-ht2 receptors in the modulation of auditory filtering. it has been suggested that inadequate central processing mechanisms underlie schizophrenics’ self-reported inability to filter incoming sensory information (judd et al., 1992; waldo et al., 1994). auditory filtering mechanisms can be assessed, in both humans and animals, using a condition-test paradigm in which two identical stimuli are presented close together (adler et al., 1982; freedman et al., 1987; braff and geyer, 1990). in most humans, the second of two vertexrecorded p50 auditory evoked potentials is markedly attenuated compared with the first when two clicks are presented at a 0.5-second interval (braff and geyer, 1990; freedman et al., 1987). in contrast, p50 responses recorded from schizophrenic patients show minimal or no attenuation (filtering) in this paradigm (freedman et al., 1987). in rats, a midlatency auditory evoked potential, n40, which has filtering properties analogous to the human p50 wave, can be recorded from brain surface. similar to observations in humans, most rats show filtering of the n40 wave in response to paired clicks (stevens et al., 1993, 1995). however, administration of psychogenic agents (e.g., amphetamine or phencyclidine) produces a nonfiltering, schizophrenic-like response pattern (adler et al., 1986). thus, the n40 wave in rats can serve as a model to study the neurobiological substrates of because of its close clinical similarity to acute paranoid schizophrenia, amphetamine psychosis may serve as a useful experimental model for schizophrenia. molecular and clinical studies suggest that both the schizophrenia-like symptoms of amphetamine psychosis and the specific ability of phenothiazines to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia and amphetamine psychosis may be the result of interactions with dopamine systems in the brain. the author discusses some implications of the roles dopamine and norepinephrine may play in mediating some schizophrenic symptoms.
grizzly bears (ursus arctos horribilis) have evolved remarkable metabolic adaptations including enormous fat accumulation during the active season followed by fasting during hibernation. however, these fluctuations in body mass do not cause the same harmful effects associated with obesity in humans. to better understand these seasonal transitions, we performed insulin and glucose tolerance tests in captive grizzly bears, characterized the annual profiles of circulating adipokines, and tested the anorectic effects of centrally administered leptin at different times of the year. we also used bear gluteal adipocyte cultures to test insulin and beta-adrenergic sensitivity in vitro. bears were insulin resistant during hibernation but were sensitive during the spring and fall active periods. hibernating bears remained euglycemic, possibly due to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia. adipokine concentrations were relatively low throughout the active season but peaked in mid-october prior to hibernation when fat content was greatest. serum glycerol was highest during hibernation, indicating ongoing lipolysis. centrally administered leptin reduced food intake in october, but not in august, revealing seasonal variation in the brain’s sensitivity to its anorectic effects. this was supported by strong phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 labeling within the hypothalamus of hibernating bears; labeling virtually disappeared in active bears. adipocytes collected during hibernation were insulin resistant when cultured with hibernation serum but became sensitive when cultured with active season serum. heat treatment of active serum blocked much of this action. clarifying the cellular mechanisms responsible for the physiology of hibernating bears may inform new treatments for metabolic disorders. grizzly bears (ursus arctos horribilis) are inactive for up to 6 months during hibernation. they undergo profound seasonal changes in food intake, body mass, and energy expenditure. the circa-annual regulation of metabolism is poorly understood. in this study, we measured plasma ghrelin, leptin, obestatin, and neuropeptide-y (npy) levels, hormones known to be involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, in ten grizzly bears. blood samples were collected during the active summer period, early hibernation and late hibernation. plasma levels of leptin, obestatin, and npy did not change between the active and the hibernation periods. plasma total ghrelin and desacyl-ghrelin concentrations significantly decreased during the inactive winter period compared to summer levels. the elevated ghrelin levels may help enhance body mass during pre-hibernation, while the low plasma ghrelin concentrations during hibernation season may contribute to the maintenance of hypophagia, low energy utilization and behavioral inactivity. our results suggest that ghrelin plays a potential role in the regulation of metabolic changes and energy homeostasis during hibernation in grizzly bears.
objectivethis meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of 5 mg/day vortioxetine compared to placebo for adult major depressive disorder.methodswe performed a meta-analysis of the double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 5 mg/day vortioxetine in adult patients with major depressive disorder published on pubmed, ebsco, and psycinfo, and the clinical trials databases were searched from 2000 through october 2013. the abstracts for the annual meetings of the american psychiatric association (apa) and previous reviews were searched to identify additional studies. results were expressed with odds ratios (ors) with their 95 % confidence interval (ci). the effect size (es) for the four studies was derived by computing the standardized mean difference (smd). the data were pooled with a random effects model.resultsfive rcts met the selection criteria. results of the meta-analysis showed the following: (1) the treatment response of 5 mg/day vortioxetine group was greater than placebo group (or = 1.84, 95 % ci = 1.16–2.93, z = 2.59, p = 0.010), and there was a significant antidepressant effect of vortioxetine (es = 2.98, p = 0.001). however, there was no significant difference in remission (or = 1.47, 95 % ci = 0.95–2.30, z = 1.71, p = 0.090). (2) the common adverse effects included nausea, dizziness, headache, dry mouth, and diarrhea. there was a significant difference for nausea between the two groups (or = 3.01, 95 % ci = 2.22–4.09, z = 7.08, p = 0.00001), but no significant differences were observed for the other four adverse effects.conclusionsfor the treatment of major depressive disorder, our results show that a dose of 5 mg/day vortioxetine was more effective, but more easily induced nausea, compared to placebo. abstract objective: vortioxetine (lu aa21004) is an investigational antidepressant. in vitro studies indicate that vortioxetine is a 5-ht3, 5-ht7, and 5-ht1d receptor antagonist, 5-ht1b receptor partial agonist, 5-ht1a receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-ht transporter. this trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of 2.5 and 5 mg vortioxetine for the treatment of mdd. research design and methods: adults (n = 611) with mdd were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo, vortioxetine (2.5 or 5 mg) or active reference (duloxetine 60 mg). the primary measure was change from baseline in the 24-item hamilton depression scale (ham-d24). secondary endpoints included responder rate, clinical global impression scale-global improvement scale (cgi-i), and remission rate. participants were monitored for adverse events (aes), and treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction using the arizona sexual experiences (asex) scale. results: both doses of vortioxetine were associated with declines in ham-d24 total scores compared to placebo but were not statistically significant. at 8 weeks, changes from baseline were [mean (se)]: −10.50 (0.76) placebo, −12.04 (0.74) 2.5 mg vortioxetine, and −11.08 (0.74) 5 mg vortioxetine. secondary outcome measures in the vortioxetine groups, including responder rate, cgi-i, and remission rate, were also not significantly different from placebo. duloxetine treatment was associated with declines in ham-d24 total score [−13.47(0.75); p = 0.005] as well as significant improvements in secondary outcome measures versus placebo (p ≤ 0.05). the most common aes for vortioxetine were nausea, dry mouth, and headache. rates of sexual dysfunction (asex) were 51.0%, 37.5%, 46.9%, and 33.3% in the vortioxetine 2.5 mg, vortioxetine 5 mg, duloxetine, and placebo groups, respectively. conclusions: in this study of adults with mdd treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5 mg or 5 mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo. study limitations are discussed, including patient characteristics, mdd severity, drug dosing, and aspects of trial design. both doses of vortioxetine were well tolerated. this trial has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov #nct00672620
individuals with autism spectrum disorders have impairments in language acquisition, but the underlying mechanism of these deficits is poorly understood. implicit learning is potentially relevant to language development, particularly in speech segmentation, which relies on sensitivity to transitional probabilities between speech sounds. this study investigated the relationship between implicit learning and current language abilities in school-aged children with high functioning autism and a history of language delay (n = 17) and in children with typical development (n = 24) using a well-studied artificial language learning task. results suggest that high functioning children with autism (hfa) and td groups were equally able to implicitly learn transitional probabilities from a lengthy stimulus stream. furthermore, task performance was not strongly associated with current language abilities. implications for implicit learning research in hfa are discussed. joint attention abilities play a crucial role in the development of autism. impairments in joint attention are among the earliest signs of the disorder and joint attention skills relate to outcome, both in the 'natural course' of autism and through being targeted in early intervention programmes. in the current study, concurrent and longitudinal associations between joint attention and other social communication abilities measured in a sample of infants with autism and related pervasive developmental disorders at age 20 months, and language and symptom severity at age 42 months, were examined. extending the findings from previous studies, joint attention ability was positively associated with language gains and (lower) social and communication symptoms, and imitation ability was also positively associated with later language. some specificity in the association between different aspects of joint attention behaviours and outcome was found: declarative, triadic gaze switching predicted language and symptom severity but imperative, dyadic eye contact behaviours did not. further, although joint attention was associated with later social and language symptoms it was unrelated to repetitive and stereotyped symptoms, suggesting the latter may have a separate developmental trajectory. possible deficits in psychological and neurological processes that might underlie the impaired development of joint attention in autism are discussed.
background although it can result in serious complications due to its narrow therapeutic index, warfarin is widely used in the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders. however, patients’ adherence and knowledge are determinants of therapeutic success. objective we sought to validate instruments to provide a reliable means of identifying gaps in patient understanding and nonadherence to inform targeted pharmacists’ interventions to improve these measures. methods a cross-sectional survey was conducted. patients’ knowledge about warfarin was rated using an arabic-language tool. medication adherence was assessed using the eight-item morisky medication adherence scale (mmas-8). the international normalized ratio (inr) control was quantified by the rosendaal method. setting at the security forces hospital anticoagulant clinic (acc), riyadh. main outcome measure validity of a knowledge and adherence tool. results totally, 101 patients completed the questionnaires. interestingly, the knowledge tool demonstrated good internal consistency (total cronbach’s alpha = 0.75) and significant concurrent validity with adherence levels. fifty-two patients were classified as having unsatisfactory knowledge. deficiency in knowledge was most obvious with respect to the consequences of missing a dose and when to seek immediate medical attention. the mmas-8 had moderate reliability (cronbach’s alpha = 0.65); however, its concurrent validity with good inr control was not demonstrated. conclusions this study revealed high prevalence of nonadherence and poor knowledge in the population visiting the acc. given that available knowledge and adherence tools seemed to have little validity in predicting clinical outcomes, structured tools should be designed, considering progression in clinical outcomes with future pharmacists’ interventions. objective to evaluate patients’ knowledge of warfarin and its relationship to anticoagulation control. methods from january to march 1999, 122 patients attending the warfarin clinic of the prince of wales hospital in hong kong were interviewed. their knowledge of warfarin therapy and adherence to medical advice were tested by 9 questions. a score (maximum 1.0) was calculated for each patient. the number of international normalized ratios (inrs) that was within the target range in the 4 most recent clinic visits was noted. results fifty-six men and 66 women participated in the study (mean ± sd age 58.0 ± 13.0, duration of treatment 43.1 ± 39.8 mo). patients’ warfarin knowledge was poor, with an overall score of 0.48 ± 0.18. participants generally knew the colors of their warfarin tablets and took them regularly. they almost always informed their physicians and dentists of their warfarin therapy. only 40–45% of patients knew the strengths of their warfarin tablets, the reason for taking warfarin, and its effect on the body. their deficiencies in knowledge were even more obvious with respect to the possible consequences of under- or over-anticoagulation, drugs and medicated oils that might interact with warfarin, and management of a missed dose. knowledge was related to age (r −0.43; p < 0.001) and duration of therapy (r 0.18; p = 0.044). sixty patients (49.2%) had read the information booklet on warfarin and had better knowledge than those who had not (0.53 ± 0.20 vs. 0.42 ± 0.20; p < 0.001). illiteracy was the main reason for not reading the booklet. there was a positive correlation between patients’ warfarin knowledge and the number of inr values that was within the target range in the 4 most recent clinic visits (r 0.20; p = 0.024). conclusions patients’ warfarin knowledge, a determinant of anticoagulation control, was generally poor. more attention should be given to the education of elderly and illiterate patients.
backgroundcardiac autonomic neuropathy (can) is a common complication of diabetes associated with poor prognosis. in addition, the autonomic imbalance is associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd) in diabetes. it is thought that adipocytokines contribute to the increased risk of vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). however, literature data on the association between can with adipocytokines such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), adiponectin in subjects with t2dm is limited.therefore, in the present study, we examined the relationship between fasting serum leptin, tnf- alpha and adiponectin and can in korean t2dm patients.methodsa total of 142 t2dm patients (94 males, 48 females) were recruited. can was assessed by the five tests according to the ewing's protocol and the time and frequency domain of the heart rate variability (hrv) was evaluated. serum tnf-alpha and adiponectin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum leptin levels were measured using radioimmunoassay.resultsalthough, the mean levels of leptin, tnf-alpha and adiponectin were not significantly different between the groups with and without can, the levels of leptin and adiponectin had a tendency to increase as the score of can increased (p = 0.05, p = 0.036). serum leptin levels demonstrated a negative correlation with low frequency (lf) in the upright position (p = 0.037). regarding tnf-alpha, a significant negative correlation was observed with sdnn and rmssd in the upright position (p = 0.023, p = 0.019). adiponectin levels were not related to any hrv parameters. multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the odds of can increased with a longer duration of diabetes (1.25, [1.07-1.47]) and higher homeostatic model of assessment-insulin resistance (homa-ir) (5.47, [1.8-16.5]). the relative risks for the presence of can were 14.1 and 51.6 for the adiponectin 2nd, 3rd tertiles when compared with first tertile (p-value for trend = 0.022).conclusionsin the present study, the higher serum adiponectin levels and homa-ir were associated with an increased risk for the presence of can. also, the can score correlated with the serum adiponectin. serum adipocytokines such as leptin and tnf-alpha were significantly correlated with parameters of hrv, representative markers of can. future prospective studies with larger number of patients are required to establish a direct relationship between plasma adipocytokine concentrations and the development or severity of can. abstract—results from animal experimentation suggest a 2-way interaction between leptin and the sympathetic nervous system, with leptin causing sympathetic activation and conversely, with the sympathetic system exercising regulatory feedback inhibition over leptin release. we have now tested this hypothesis in humans. in the absence of results from leptin infusions, to test for sympathetic stimulation of leptin release, we sought a quantitative naturalistic linkage of sympathetic activity with leptin plasma concentration across a broad range of leptin values in men of widely differing adiposity. renal norepinephrine spillover was correlated with plasma leptin (r =0.628, p <0.01), but other measures of sympathoadrenal function did not. to test for sympathetic and adrenomedullary inhibition of leptin release, we studied clinical models of high sympathetic tone, heart failure, and essential hypertension, in which lowered plasma leptin levels might have been expected but were not found; a model of low sympathetic activity, pure autonomic failure, in which plasma leptin level was normal (6.1±1.2 vs 12.8±3.1 ng/ml in healthy subjects); and a clinical model of reduced epinephrine secretion, healthy aging, in which plasma leptin level again was normal (5.7±1.1 ng/ml vs 4.0±0.9 ng/ml in men >60 years and <35 years, respectively). paradoxically, leptin concentration was elevated in heart failure, caused entirely by reduced renal clearance of leptin release, 142.0±30.5 ml/min, compared with 56.9±18.9 ml/min (p <0.05). these results provide some support for the view that leptin stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, at least for renal sympathetic outflow, but do not confirm the concept of regulatory feedback inhibition of leptin release by the sympathetic nervous system.
we have tested galvanovskis and sandblom’s prediction that ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by cells as well as how the elicited signals couple to metabolic alterations. electric field application was timed to coincide with certain known intracellular chemical oscillators (phase-matched conditions). polarized, but not spherical, neutrophils labeled with anti-kv1.3, fl-dhp, and anti-trp1, but not anti-t-type ca2+ channels, displayed clusters at the lamellipodium. resonance energy transfer experiments showed that these channel pairs were in close proximity. dose-field sensitivity studies of channel blockers suggested that k+ and ca2+ channels participate in field detection, as judged by enhanced oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes. further studies suggested that k+ channel blockers act by reducing the neutrophil’s membrane potential. mibefradil and skf93635, which block t-type ca2+ channels and socs, respectively, affected field detection at appropriate doses. microfluorometry and high-speed imaging of indo-1-labeled neutrophils was used to examine ca2+ signaling. electric fields enhanced ca2+ spike amplitude and triggered formation of a second traveling ca2+ wave. mibefradil blocked ca2+ spikes and waves. although 10 μm skf96365 mimicked mibefradil, 7 μm skf96365 specifically inhibited electric field-induced ca2+ signals, suggesting that one skf96365-senstive site is influenced by electric fields. although cells remained morphologically polarized, ion channel clusters at the lamellipodium and electric field sensitivity were inhibited by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. as a result of phase-matched electric field application in the presence of ion channel clusters, myeloperoxidase (mpo) was found to traffic to the cell surface. as mpo participates in high amplitude metabolic oscillations, this suggests a link between the signaling apparatus and metabolic changes. furthermore, electric field effects could be blocked by mpo inhibition or removal while certain electric field effects were mimicked by the addition of mpo to untreated cells. therefore, channel clustering plays an important role in electric field detection and downstream responses of morphologically polarized neutrophils. in addition to providing new mechanistic insights concerning electric field interactions with cells, our work suggests novel methods to remotely manipulate physiological pathways. application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
type xvii collagen (180-kda bullous pemphigoid antigen) is a structural component of hemidesmosomes. mutations in the type xvii collagen gene (col17a1) have been established to be the molecular basis of non-herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (jeb-nh), an inherited skin blistering disorder. here we report for the first time truncated type xvii collagen expression, caused by homozygosity for a col17a1 donor splice-site mutation (4261+1 g → c), which was identified by pcr amplification on genomic dna. by rt-pcr and sequencing of cdna derived from mrna from the patient’s cultured keratinocytes, we provide evidence of cryptic splicing and exon skipping, most abundantly of exon 52. jeb-nh patients with col17a1 splice-site mutations resulting in an exon skip often have no immunologically detectable type xvii collagen. however, in our patient with the generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa subtype, a small amount of type xvii collagen was detectable in the skin, and immunoblotting of cultured keratinocytes revealed that the 180-kda protein was 10 kda shorter. we hypothesize that the function of this truncated type xvii collagen polypeptide, which is expressed at low levels, is impaired, explaining the jeb-nh phenotype. recent biochemical studies have shown that the fibroblasts from a patient with ehlers-danlos syndrome type viib produce nearly equal amounts of normal and shortened pro-alpha 2(i) collagen chains (wirtz, m.k., glanville, r. w., steinmann, b., rao, v. h., and hollister, d. (1987) j. biol. chem. 262, 16376-16385). compositional and sequencing studies of the abnormal pro-alpha 2(i) chain identified an interstitial deletion of 18 residues corresponding to the n-telopeptide of the collagen molecule. since this region is encoded by a 54-base pair exon, number 6, the protein defect could have been caused by gene deletion, abnormal pre-mrna splicing, or both. here, in order to elucidate the molecular nature of this mutation we have analyzed the sequences of pro-alpha 2(i) collagen cdna and genomic clones obtained from rna and dna of the patient's fibroblasts. using oligomer-specific cloning we identified a cdna that contains a 54-base pair deletion corresponding precisely to the sequence of exon 6. identification of the normal gene was based on the finding of an identical sequence polymorphism in a normal cdna and in the genomic clone derived from one of the two collagen alleles. the other gene, instead, displayed a base substitution (t to c) in the obligatory gt dinucleotide of the 5' splice-site sequence of intron 6. analysis of nearly 100 base pairs immediately 5' to exons 5, 6, and 7, and 3' to exons 5 and 7 did not reveal any additional change. therefore, the data strongly suggest that the observed gt-to-gc transition at the splice donor site of intron 6 generates an abnormally spliced mrna in which the sequence of exon 5 is joined to the sequence of exon 7. since skipping of exon 6 does not interfere with the coding frame of the mrna, the resulting shortened polypeptide, albeit utilized in the assembly of a procollagen trimer, ultimately causes the ehlers-danlos syndrome type vii phenotype.
centralized search process requires that the whole collection reside at a single site. this imposes a burden on both the system storage of the site and the network traffic near the site. it thus comes to require the search process to be distributed. recently, more and more web sites provide the ability to search their local collection of web pages. query brokering systems are used to direct queries to the promising sites and merge the results from these sites. creation of meta-information of the sites plays an important role in such systems. in this article, we introduce an ontology-based web site mapping method used to produce conceptual meta-information, the vector space approach, and present a serial of experiments comparing it with naïve-bayes approach. we found that the vector space approach produces better accuracy in ontology-based web site mapping. recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as c4.5. this fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. in this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning bayesian networks. these networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. among these approaches we single out a method we call tree augmented naive bayes (tan), which outperforms naive bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive bayes. we experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the university of california at irvine repository, and compared them to c4.5, naive bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection.
background depression symptoms is highly comorbid with methamphetamine (meth) dependence. except for the role in the pathophysiology of depression symptoms, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) is also involved in the meth dependence. the present study aims to explore whether bdnf plays a role in the development of depression symptoms during meth withdrawal.   methods we recruited 179 patients with meth dependence who were followed up for two weeks. ultimately, 131 (73.2%) patients finished the follow-up. besides, 90 healthy controls were also recruited. serum bdnf levels were measured by duoset elisa development system upon admission. the short form (13 items) of the beck depression inventory (bdi) and amphetamine withdrawal questionnaire (awq) were used to measure the depression and withdrawal symptoms. patients with bdi score ≥ 8 were identified to have depression symptoms.   results of the 131 patients, 64 (48.9%) were identified to have depression symptoms at the two-week endpoint. patients with depression symptoms showed significantly lower bdnf levels than those with no depression symptoms. serum bdnf levels (≤ 1251.0pg/ml) were independently associated with the development of depression symptoms during meth withdrawal (or = 3.50, 95% ci, 1.14-10.73, p = 0.028).   limitations bdnf levels were tested in serum but not in brain and the baseline bdi and awq scores between the depression and non-depression groups were not matched. besides, the follow-up time was relatively short.   conclusions our study demonstrated that patients with serum bdnf levels ≤ 1251.0pg/ml had higher risk of depression symptoms during meth withdrawal. during brain development, neural precursor cells migrate along radial glial fibers to populate the neocortex. rna interference (rnai) of the lissencephaly gene lis1 (also known as pafah1b1) inhibits somal movement but not process extension of neural precursors in live brain slices. here we report imaging of the subcellular events accompanying neural precursor migration and the effects of lis1, cytoplasmic dynein and myosin ii inhibition. centrosomes move continuously and often far in advance of nuclei, which show extreme saltatory behavior. lis1 and dynein rnai inhibit centrosomal and nuclear movement independently, whereas myosin ii inhibition blocks only nuclear translocation. imaging of the microtubule end-binding protein 3 (eb3) reveals a centrosome-centered array of microtubules in live neural precursors under all conditions examined. dynein is concentrated both at a swelling in the leading process reported to initiate each migratory cycle and in the soma. thus, dynein pulls on the microtubule network from the swelling. the nucleus is transported along the trailing microtubules by dynein assisted by myosin ii.
the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of almost fully amorphous mg(72) zn(23) ca(5) and crystalline mg(70) zn(23) ca(5) pd(2) alloys during immersion in hank's balanced salt solution (hbss), as well as their cytocompatibility, are investigated in order to assess the feasibility of both materials as biodegradable implants. though the crystalline mg(70) zn(23) ca(5) pd(2) sample shows lower wettability and more positive corrosion potential, this sample degrades much faster upon incubation in hbss as a consequence of the formation of micro-galvanic couples between the nobler pd-rich dendrites and the surrounding phases. after 22-h immersion, the concentration of mg ions in the hbss medium containing the mg(70) zn(23) ca(5) pd(2) sample is six times larger than for mg(72) zn(23) ca(5) . due to the zn enrichment and the incipient porosity, the mechanical properties of the mg(72) zn(23) ca(5) sample improve within the first stages of biodegradation (i.e., hardness increases while the young's modulus decreases, thus rendering an enhanced wear resistance). cytocompatibility studies reveal that neither mg(72) zn(23) ca(5) nor mg(70) zn(23) ca(5) pd(2) are cytotoxic, although preosteoblast cell adhesion is to some extent precluded, particularly onto the surface of mg(70) zn(23) ca(5) pd(2) , because of the relatively high hydrophobicity. because of their outstanding properties and their time-evolution, the use of the pd-free alloy in temporary implants such as screws, stents, and sutures is envisioned. certain dental alloys have been claimed to cause gingival and periodontal inflammation. however, little information is available on the molecules mediating the mechanism of such an effect. recently, a three-dimensional cell culture system consisting of human fibroblasts and keratinocytes has been introduced for evaluating the irritancy of cosmetic products, including the analysis of inflammatory mediators. in the present study the influence of pure metals and a high noble dental cast alloy upon cell viability and the synthesis of the proinflammatory mediator interleukin-6 was recorded in this in vitro skin equivalent model. the cultures were exposed to test specimens fabricated from copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, palladium, tin, indium, a high noble cast alloy and a dental ceramic. cell vitality was reduced after a 24 h exposure to copper (14-25% of untreated controls), cobalt (60%), zinc (63%), indium (85%), nickel (87%), and the heat treated and not heat treated high noble cast alloy (87%/90%). dental ceramic, palladium and tin did not influence cell viability. increased il-6 levels were observed in cultures exposed to copper (5-19-fold compared to untreated controls), zinc (16-fold), cobalt (12-fold), nickel (10-fold) and palladium (4-fold). other materials tested produced il-6 levels comparable to those of untreated controls. our findings suggest that metal ions are involved in proinflammatory activity at low toxicity and non-toxic levels as assessed by different biological endpoints.
the ability of rhd patients to use context under conditions of increased processing demands was examined. subjects monitored for words in auditorily presented sentences of three context types-normal, semantically anomalous, and random, at three rates of speech normal, 70% compressed (experiment 1) and 60% compressed (experiment 2). effects of semantics and syntax were found for the rhd and normal groups under the normal rate of speech condition. using compressed rates of speech, the effect of syntax disappeared, but the effect of semantics remained. importantly, and contrary to expectations, the rhd group was similar to normals in continuing to demonstrate an effect of semantic context under conditions of increased processing demands. results are discussed relative to contemporary theories of laterality, based on studies with normals, that suggest that the involvement of the left versus right hemisphere in context use may depend upon the type of contextual information being processed. the ability of right-brain-damaged (rbd) patients to use on-line contextual information in a word-monitoring task was examined. subjects were required to monitor for target words in the contexts of both normal and semantically anomalous sentences. similar to previous studies with normals (e.g., marslen-wilson & tyler, 1980), the semantic integrity of the context was influential in the word-recognition process. importantly, the rbd patients performed similarly to normals in showing context effects. these results were interpreted as substantiating the findings of leonard, waters, and caplan (1997a, 1997b) that rbd patients do not present with a specific deficit in the use of contextual information. the results are discussed in terms of proposals that suggest that an impaired ability to use contextual information by rbd patients may be a function of increased processing demands.
backgroundhost single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) near the interleukin 28b (il28b) locus are associated with sustained virological response to antiviral therapy and with spontaneous hepatitis c virus (hcv) clearance. prevalence of these snps varies depending on ethnicity. the impact of il28b snps in hcv-infected patients is currently unknown in uruguay. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the distribution of polymorphisms in the il28b gene (rs12979860 and rs8099917) among hcv-infected patients and healthy individuals in uruguay and thus assess their possible association with the establishment of hcv infection.methodsdna was recovered from 92 non-infected individuals and 78 hcv-infected patients and snps were determined by rflp and allelic discrimination by real-time pcr.resultsthe distribution of rs12979860 genotypes for the infected population was 29.5%-cc, 47.4%-ct and 23.1%-tt and for the control group 45.7%, 42.4% and 11.9%, respectively. prevalence in both infected and uninfected individuals is similar to that reported in other countries with admixed populations. the distribution of rs8099917 genotypes for the infected population was 57.7%-tt, 27.2%-tg and 14.1%-gg and for the control group 60.9%, 33.7% and 5.4%, respectively. the comparison of rs12979860 genotype distribution between the two populations evidenced a higher prevalence of the favourable genotype (cc) in the uninfected control group (p < 0.05). additionally, results generated using logistic regression analysis show that individuals carrying rs12979860-tt or ct genotypes have a higher likelihood of developing chronic hepatitis upon infection with hcv, when compared to cc carriers, considering rs8099917 genotype as constant.conclusionpatients with hcv infection have a statistically significant lower prevalence of the favourable rs12979860 genotype when compared to uninfected individuals; therefore we can establish that only il28b rs12979860-ct and tt genotypes seem to contribute to the occurrence of chronic hcv infection in the cohort of uruguayan population studied. considering that a trend towards a higher frequency of “good” response genotypes was observed in responder patients, we believe that il28b rs12979860 genotyping could be a useful tool for predicting different therapies outcome, including in the daa era. background: about 30% of individuals with hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection are able to clear hcv spontaneously. differences in host genetics affect the outcome of hcv infection. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of the interferon lambda (ifnl) genes were associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of hcv infection. objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the ifnl4 rs12979860 snp and spontaneous clearance of hcv infection in iranian population. materials and methods: a case-control study was designed on 91 cases with spontaneous hcv infection clearance and 259 patients with persistent hcv infection as the control group. the rs12979860 snp was assessed as the most common ifnl polymorphism by pcr-rflp method. results: distribution of rs12979860 cc genotype in the spontaneous clearance group was around two folds of its distribution in chronic hepatitis c group (p < 0.001, or = 4.09, 95% ci = 2.44-6.86). conclusions: the rs12979860 snp was observed as a strong host genetic factor associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis c infection.
we hypothesized that immunoliposomes (ils) that target epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and/or its truncated variant egfrviii can be constructed to provide efficient intracellular drug delivery in tumor cells overexpressing these receptors. monoclonal antibody fragments included fab fragments derived from c225, which binds both egfr and egfrviii, or novel anti-egfr scfv c10, which binds egfr only. monoclonal antibody fragments were covalently linked to liposomes containing various reporters or drugs. ils were evaluated for specific binding, internalization, and cytotoxicity in egfr/egfrviii-overexpressing cell lines in vitro. flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy showed that egfr-targeted ils, but not nontargeted liposomes or irrelevant ils, were efficiently bound and internalized by egfr-overexpressing cells, including glioma cells (u-87), carcinoma cells (a-431 and mda-mb-468), and egfrviii stable transfectants (nr-6m). furthermore, egfr-targeted ils did not bind to non-egfr-overexpressing cells (mcf-7 and parental nr-6). ils showed 3 orders of magnitude greater accumulation in nr-6-egfrviii stable transfectants versus parental nr-6 cells. quantitative internalization studies indicated binding of egfr-targeted ils to target cells within 5 min, followed by intracellular accumulation beginning at 15 min; total uptake reached 13,000 ils/cell. ils were used to deliver cytotoxic drugs doxorubicin, vinorelbine, or methotrexate to egfr/ egfrviii-overexpressing target cells in vitro. in each case, the il agent was significantly more cytotoxic than the corresponding nontargeted liposomal drug in target cells, whereas it was equivalent in cells lacking egfr/egfrviii overexpression. we conclude that egfr-targeted ils provide efficient and targeted delivery of anticancer drugs in cells overexpressing egfr or egfrviii. purpose anti-her2 immunoliposomes combine the tumor-targeting of certain anti-her2 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) with the pharmacokinetic and drug delivery capabilities of sterically stabilized liposomes. we previously showed that anti-her2 immunoliposomes bind efficiently to and internalize in her2-overexpressing cells in vitro, resulting in intracellular drug delivery.   experimental design here we describe the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of anti-her2 immunoliposomes containing doxorubicin (dox) in a series of animal models.   results immunoliposomes displayed long circulation that was identical to that of sterically stabilized liposomes in single- and multiple-dose studies in normal rats. anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox produced marked therapeutic results in four different her2-overexpressing tumor xenograft models, including growth inhibition, regression, and cures. these results demonstrated that encapsulation of dox in anti-her2 immunoliposomes greatly increased its therapeutic index, both by increasing antitumor efficacy and by reducing systemic toxicity. immunoliposome-dox was significantly superior to all other treatment conditions tested, including free dox, liposomal dox, and anti-her2 mab (trastuzumab). when compared with liposomal dox in eight separate therapy studies in her2-overexpressing models, immunoliposome delivery produced significantly superior antitumor efficacy in each study (p < 0.0001 to 0.04). anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox containing either recombinant human mab her2-fab' or scfv c6.5 yielded comparable therapeutic efficacy. cure rates for immunoliposome-dox reached 50% (11 of 21) with optimized immunoliposomes and matrigel-free tumors and overall was 16% (18 of 115) versus no cures (0 of 124) with free dox or liposomal dox. finally, anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox was also superior to combinations consisting of free mab plus free dox or free mab plus liposomal dox.   conclusions anti-her2 immunoliposomes produced enhanced antitumor efficacy via targeted delivery.
the aim of this trial was to compare the effect of supplementation of goats with different forms of selenium on the metabolism of their kids at the time of weaning. the experiment was performed with 45 kids of mothers supplemented with various forms of selenium. group c was control while the other four groups were supplemented with selenium for six weeks before (0.3 mg/goat/day) and after parturition (0.9 mg/goat/day). group se-i received sodium selenite while the other groups received organic forms: se-lactate-protein complex (se-l), se-proteinate (se-p) and se-yeast (se-y). the kids were weaned at three months of age and samples of blood and urine were taken. parameters monitored in the blood included se, glutathione peroxidase (gpx), zn, cu, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, protein, immunoglobulins, muscle enzymes, total antioxidant status, vitamin a and e. se levels were determined in the urine. selenium supplementation of goats from six weeks before delivery significantly influenced selenium concentrations in the blood of kids. significant differences (p < 0.0002) were found between the control and all experimental groups and further between se-y and the other experimental the aim of this trial was to compare the effect of long-term supplementation of goats with different forms of selenium on body reserves of selenium in their kids at the time of weaning. thirty-three pregnant goats were divided into five groups. group c was control while the other four groups were supplemented with selenium (se) for 6 weeks before parturition (0.3 mg/goat/day) and after parturition (0.9 mg/goat/day). group “se-i” received sodium selenite and three other groups received organic forms: “se-l,” lactate–protein complex; “se-p,” se-proteinate; and “se-y,” se-yeast. the kids were weaned at 3 months of age and samples of tissues (liver, pancreas, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, spleen, thigh, tongue, and diaphragm) were taken after slaughtering. the long-term supplementation of goats with se influenced se concentration in all examined tissues of kids. significant differences (p ≤ 0.01) were found between the control and all experimental groups, except for the renal cortex and pancreas (se-i). the average increase of se concentration in overall examined tissues in comparison with the control (100%) was as follows: se-y, 192%; se-p, 167%; se-l, 161%; se-i, 144%. the highest efficiency was found in the group supplemented with se-yeast with a high content of selenomethionine, also the other two organic forms of se were more efficient than the inorganic form.
that dopamine (da) plays a role in reward-related learning is well documented but the mechanisms through which it acts are not well understood. the present set of experiments investigated the role of da receptor subtypes within da-innervated forebrain regions in brain stimulation reward (bsr). thirty-two rats were implanted with electrodes in the ventral tegmental area (vta) and cannulae aimed at the caudal nucleus accumbens (nacc), the caudate-putamen (cp) or cortex. rate-frequency functions were determined by logarithmically decreasing the number of cathodal pulses in a stimulation train from a value that sustained maximal responding to one that did not sustain responding (thresholds). after bsr thresholds stabilized rats received treatments with da agonists and their effects on thresholds were analyzed. systemic treatments consisted of injections of (+)-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p., 10 min before testing), the d2 agonist quinpirole (1.0 mg/kg, i.p., 10 min before testing), the novel d1 agonist a-77636 (3.0 mg/kg, s.c., 90 min before testing) or their vehicle (distilled h(2)0). central treatments consisted of microinjections of quinpirole (0.3-10.0 micrograms/0.5 microliter) directly into the caudal nacc, cp or cortex or a-77636 (30 micrograms/0.5 microliter) into the caudal nacc or cp. results showed that all three agonists, when injected systemically, significantly reduced the threshold frequency required for vta bsr, indicating a potentiative effect on reward. central injections of quinpirole in the caudal nacc, cp or cortex produced significant increases in bsr thresholds indicative of reduced rewarding efficacy of stimulation. central injections of a-77636 into the caudal nacc, but not the cp, were associated with a reduction in vta bsr thresholds, suggesting an increase in reward. these results suggest that stimulation of d1 or d2 receptors enhances the rewarding effect of brain stimulation. in the case of the systemic quinpirole enhancement of reward, the present results suggest that this may not occur in the caudal nacc, cp or cortex. finally, the present results suggest that d1 receptor stimulation in the caudal nacc can facilitate reward-related learning. the conditioned place preference technique was used to assess the affective properties of the direct dopamine d1 agonist, skf38393, and the direct d2 agonist, ly171555 (quinpirole). a three compartment apparatus was used: the animals' pre-experimental preference for the two choice compartments was equal and, within each experimental group, half the rats received drug pairings in each choice compartment. intraperitoneal injections of skf38393 produced conditioned place aversions at all doses tested (1.0–4.0 mg/kg); ly171555 produced weak conditioned place preferences at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, but no reliable effect at 4.0 mg/kg. bilateral intra-accumbens microinjections of skf38393 produced strong preferences at all doses tested (0.5–2.0 µg/side); ly171555 produced strong preferences at two doses (0.5 and 1.0 µg/side) and no effect at a third dose (2.0 µg/side). these results suggest that activation of either d1 or d2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens can produce reward, and that d1 receptors (and possibly also d2 receptors) located elsewhere in the brain or in the periphery may mediate aversive effects.
aims/hypothesisthe relative contribution of increasing incidence and declining mortality to increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in scotland is unclear. trends in incidence and mortality rates are described for type 2 diabetes in scotland between 2004 and 2013 by age, sex and socioeconomic deprivation.methodsdata for incident and prevalent cases of type 2 diabetes were obtained from the scottish national diabetes register with number of deaths identified from linkage to mortality records. population size and death data for scotland by age, sex and socioeconomic deprivation were obtained from national records of scotland. age- and sex-specific incidence and mortality rates stratified by year and deciles of socioeconomic status were calculated using poisson models.resultsthere were 180,290 incident cases of type 2 diabetes in scotland between 2004 and 2013. overall, incidence of type 2 diabetes remained stable over time and was 4.88 (95% ci 4.84, 4.90) and 3.33 (3.28, 3.32) per 1000 in men and women, respectively. however, incidence increased among young men, remained stable in young women, and declined in older men and women. incidence rates declined in all socioeconomic groups but increased after 2008 in the most deprived groups. standardised mortality ratios associated with diabetes, adjusted for age and socioeconomic group, were 1.38 (1.36, 1.41) in men and 1.49 (1.45, 1.52) in women, and remained constant over time.conclusions/interpretationincidence of type 2 diabetes has stabilised in recent years suggesting that increasing prevalence may be primarily attributed to declining mortality. prevention of type 2 diabetes remains important, particularly among socioeconomically deprived populations. objective with improvements in cardiovascular disease (cvd) rates among people with diabetes, mortality rates may also be changing. however, these trends may be influenced by coding practices of cvd-related deaths on death certificates. we analyzed trends of mortality over 13 years in people with diabetes and quantified the potential misclassification of cvd mortality according to current coding methods. research design and methods a total of 1,136,617 australians with diabetes registered on the national diabetes services scheme between 1997 and 2010 were linked to the national death index. excess mortality relative to the australian population was reported as standardized mortality ratios (smrs). potential misclassification of cvd mortality was determined by coding cvd according to underlying cause of death (cod) and then after consideration of both the underlying and other causes listed in part i of the death certificate. results for type 1 diabetes, the smr decreased in males from 4.20 in 1997 to 3.08 in 2010 (ptrend < 0.001) and from 3.92 to 3.46 in females (ptrend < 0.01). for type 2 diabetes, the smr decreased in males from 1.40 to 1.21 (ptrend < 0.001) and from 1.56 to 1.22 in females (ptrend < 0.001). cvd deaths decreased from 35.6 to 31.2% and from 31.5 to 27.2% in males and females with type 1 diabetes, respectively (ptrend < 0.001 for both sexes). for type 2 diabetes, cvd decreased from 44.5 to 29.2% in males and from 45.5 to 31.6% in females (ptrend < 0.001 for both sexes). using traditional coding methods, ∼38 and 26% of cvd deaths are underestimated in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. conclusions all-cause and cvd mortality has decreased in diabetes. however, the total cvd mortality burden is underestimated when only underlying cod is considered. this has important ramifications for understanding mortality patterns in diabetes.
a new method for biometric identification of human irises is proposed in this paper. the method is based on morphological image processing for the identification of unique skeletons of iris structures, which are then used for feature extraction. in this approach, local iris features are represented by the most stable nodes, branches and end-points extracted from the identified skeletons. assessment of the proposed method was done using subsets of images from the university of bath iris image database (1000 images) and the casia iris image database (500 images). compelling experimental results demonstrate the viability of using the proposed morphological approach for iris recognition when compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm that uses a global feature extraction approach. algorithms first described in 1993 for recognizing persons by their iris patterns have now been tested in several public field trials, producing no false matches in several million comparison tests. the underlying recognition principle is the failure of a test of statistical independence on texture phase structure as encoded by multi-scale quadrature wavelets. the combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 244 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 bits/mm2 over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. this paper reviews the current algorithms and presents the results of 2.3 million comparisons among eye images acquired in trials in britain, the usa, and japan, and it discusses aspects of the process still in need of improvement.
this study was conducted in the silaluo region (n27°48′, e98°20′) of the drung river valley, gongshan county, yunnan, china. this valley runs adjacent to chayu in tibet to the north, and kachin state in myanmar to the south and west. the gaoligongshan and dandanglika mountains are located to the east and west of the river, respectively. these mountains descend from north to south and are characterized by steep elevational drops (4 000 m maximum) (li et al., 2015). the development of the segmented pharyngeal apparatus involves complex interaction of tissues derived from all three germ layers. the role of mesoderm is the least studied, perhaps because of its apparent lack of anatomical boundaries and positionally restricted gene expression. here, we report that the mesoderm-specific deletion of tbx1, a t-box transcription factor, caused severe pharyngeal patterning and cardiovascular defects, while mesoderm-specific restoration of tbx1 expression in a mutant background corrected most of those defects in the mouse. we show that some organs, e.g. the thymus, require tbx1 expression in the mesoderm and in the epithelia. in addition, these experiments revealed that different pharyngeal arches require tbx1 in different tissues. finally, we show that tbx1 in the mesoderm is required to sustain cell proliferation. thus, the mesodermal transcription program is not only crucial for cardiovascular development, but is also key in the development and patterning of pharyngeal endoderm.
in the present studies, we have found a fragment of amino acid sequence, called tft motif, both in light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (lpor) and in the l subunit of dark-operative (light-independent) protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases (dpor). amino acid residues of this motif shared similar physicochemical properties in both types of the enzymes. in the present paper, physicochemical properties of amino acid residues of this common motif, its spatial arrangement and a possible physiological role are being discussed. this is the first report when similarity between lpor and dpor, phylogenetically unrelated, but functionally redundant enzymes, is described. light-dependent nadph-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (lpor) is a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein in green algae and higher plants which catalyzes the light-dependent reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide. light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis occurs in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. with the exception of angiosperms, this pathway coexists with a separate light-independent chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, which is catalyzed by light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase (dpor) in the dark. in contrast, the light-dependent function of chlorophyll biosynthesis is absent from anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. consequently, the question is whether cyanobacteria are the ancestors of all organisms that conduct light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. if so, how did photosynthetic eukaryotes acquire the homologous genes of lpor in their nuclear genomes? the large number of complete genome sequences now available allow us to detect the evolutionary history of lpor genes by conducting a genome-wide sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. here, we show the results of a detailed phylogenetic analysis of lpor and other functionally related enzymes in the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (sdr) family. we propose that the lpor gene originated in the cyanobacterial genome before the divergence of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. we postulated that the photosynthetic eukaryotes obtained their lpor homologues through endosymbiotic gene transfer.
in this study, we investigated the significance of myc, bcl2 and bcl6 gene abnormalities in a cohort of 205 diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) patients studied by conventional and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenetic analysis. combining these methods, 172 cases (84%) were classified as myc−, 17 (8%) were myc+/bcl2−/bcl6−, and 16 (8%) were double/triple-hit lymphomas (i.e. myc+/bcl2+, myc+/bcl6+, or myc+/bcl2+/bcl6+). we found a significant difference in event-free survival (efs) among the three groups (p = 0.02), with the double/triple-hit group having the worst efs. patients who were myc+, but bcl2− and bcl6−, had the best efs. we conclude that patients with myc+ dlbcl, but without bcl2 or bcl6 abnormalities, do not have a worse outcome when compared to those who are myc−. however, patients with double/triple-hit dlbcl have a very poor outcome and should be treated with aggressive or novel therapies. purpose rearrangement of myc occurs in a proportion of diffuse large b-cell lymphomas (dlbcl), where they may be associated with an adverse clinical outcome. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of myc translocations in dlbcl and their prognostic impact in the era of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab (chop-r) therapy.   patients and methods three hundred three patients with previously untreated dlbcl, with no evidence of underlying follicular lymphoma, were investigated using immunohistochemistry and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization for myc, bcl6, and t(14;18)/bcl2 rearrangements. all patients (median age, 71.1 years; range, 23 to 96 years) were treated when chop-r was standard therapy for dlbcl and observed for a maximum of 4 years. overall survival (os) at 3 years was 49% (95% ci, 42% to 56%).   results myc rearrangements were demonstrated in 35 (14%) of 245 biopsies with data available. of these, 26 (74%) also had a t(14;18), 10 (26%) were bcl6 and myc rearranged, and seven had all three abnormalities. only age, international prognostic index, and myc rearrangement retained prognostic significance in the final model. os was significantly worse for patients with rearrangement of myc (survival probability at 2 years = 0.35 in v 0.61 in the nonrearranged group).   conclusion the presence of a myc rearrangement is a strongly adverse prognostic factor in chop-r-treated patients and can be used in combination with patients' age and ipi to accurately predict clinical outcome. in dlbcl, rearrangement of myc is rarely found as the sole genetic abnormality and the poor prognosis of these patients is likely to reflect a synergistic effect alongside deregulation of bcl6 or bcl2.
hl-5 cells are cultured murine atrial cardiomyocytes and have been used in studies to address important cellular and molecular questions. however, electrophysiological features of hl-5 cells have not been characterized. in this study, we examined such properties using whole cell patch-clamp techniques. membrane capacitance of the hl-5 cells was from 8 to 62 pf. the resting membrane potential was -57.8 +/- 1.4 mv (n = 51). intracellular injection of depolarizing currents evoked action potentials (aps) with variable morphologies in 71% of the patched cells. interestingly, the incidence of successful, current-induced aps positively correlated with the hyperpolarizing degrees of resting membrane potentials (r = 0.99, p < 0.001). only a few of the patched cells (4 of 51, 7.8%) exhibited spontaneous aps. the muscarinic agonist carbachol activated the acetylcholine-activated k(+) current and significantly shortened the duration of aps. immunostaining confirmed the presence of the muscarinic receptor type 2 in hl-5 cells. the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (i(f)) was detected in 39% of the patched cells. the voltage to activate 50% of i(f) channels was -73.4 +/- 1.2 mv (n = 12). voltage-gated na(+), ca(2+), and k(+) currents were observed in the hl-5 cells with variable incidences. compared with the adult mouse cardiomyocytes, the hl-5 cells had prolonged aps and small outward k(+) currents. our data indicate that hl-5 cells display significant electrophysiological heterogeneity of morphological appearance of aps and expression of functional ion channels. compared with adult murine cardiomyocytes, hl-5 cells show an immature phenotype of cardiac ap morphology. acetylcholine (ach) decreased the contraction of rat ventricular cells within 20 s. ach (3.1 x 10(-8) m) produced a half-maximal effect and 10(-6) m ach produced a maximal effect (a 23.8 +/- 5.4% decrease; mean +/- se, n = 11). during a 3-min exposure to ach, the inotropic effect faded. parallel changes were observed in action potential duration: ach caused an immediate shortening of the action potential, but then the effect faded with time. the changes in action potential duration were the cause of the changes in contraction, because ach had no effect on contraction when the contractions were triggered by voltage-clamp pulses of constant duration. the changes in action potential duration were the result of the activation of a k+ current (ik,ach) by ach. during an exposure to ach, this current faded as a result of desensitization. ik,ach was 6.3 times smaller in ventricular than in atrial cells. this may explain why the negative inotropic effect of ach on atrial cells was greater: 1.0 x 10(-8) m ach produced a half-maximal effect on atrial cells, and 10(-6) m ach produced a near maximal effect (a 74.5 +/- 9.5% decrease; n = 4).
backgroundthis study aims to explore the prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness focused on retinal disease in a population above 60 years in nepal.methodstwo thousand one hundred subjects were enrolled in a population-based cross-sectional study. history, presenting and best corrected visual acuity after subjective refraction, anterior and posterior segment examinations was obtained in detail.resultsamong the total subjects, 1860 (88.57%) had complete information. age varies from 60 to 95 (mean age: 69.64 ± 7.31) years. low vision and blindness in both eyes at presentation was found in 984 (52.90%, 95% confidence interval (ci): 50.60–55.19) and 36 (1.94%, 95% ci: 1.35–2.66) subjects respectively. after best correction, bilateral low vision and blindness was found in 426 (22.92%, 95% ci: 21.01–24.88), and 30 (1.61%, 95% ci: 0.10–2.30) subjects respectively. as compared to 60–69 years old, risk of visual impairment was four times higher (95% ci:3.26–5.58) in the 70–79 year olds and 14 times higher (95% ci: 9.72–19.73) in the age group 80 years and above.major causes of bilateral low vision were cataract (68.07%), followed by retinal disorders (28.64%), and for blindness; retinal disorders (46.66%), followed by cataract (43.33%). illiteracy was significantly associated with visual impairment.conclusionamong the elderly population, prevalence of visual impairment was high. refractive error, cataract and retinal disorders were the major cause of low vision. screening the population at the age 60 years and above, focused on cataract and posterior segment diseases, providing glasses and timely referral can help reduce visual impairment. background a national eye care programme was launched in nepal in the early 1980s. the impact of this programme on blindness and cataract surgery prevalence was evaluated in two geographic zones. methods people aged 45 years and older were sampled using a stratified cluster design. within randomly selected clusters, door to door enumeration was followed by visual acuity measurement and eye examinations at conveniently located sites. the full survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance measures carried out. results of the 5112 enumerated individuals 90% were examined. blindness, defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 in both eyes, was found in 5.3% (95% ci 3.6, 6.8) of individuals examined, with cataract being the principal cause in at least one eye in 78% of cases. considering both cataract operated and unoperated cataract blind cases, surgical coverage was approximately 42%. conclusion the findings suggest that blindness prevalence may have decreased slightly from that estimated in a 1981 national survey, both overall and cataract related. similarly, cataract surgical coverage may have increased somewhat. none of these changes, however, are at statistically significant levels. accordingly, the blindness problem remains challengingly high.
the anti-yeast activities of a food-grade dilution-stable microemulsion against candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae have been studied. the weight ratio of the formulated microemulsion is glycerol monolaurate (gml)/propionic acid/tween 80/sodium benzoate (sb)/water = 3:9:14:14:24. results of anti-yeast activity on solid medium by agar diffusion method showed that the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion at 4.8 mg/ml was comparable to that of natamycin at 0.1 mg/ml as positive control. results of anti-yeast activity in liquid medium by broth dilution method showed that the growth of both c. albicans and s. cerevisiae was completely inhibited when the liquid medium containing 106 cfu/ml was treated with 1.2 mg/ml microemulsion, which was determined as minimum fungicidal concentration. the kinetics of killing results showed that the microemulsion killed over 90% yeast cells rapidly within 15 min and caused a complete loss of viability in 120 min. among the components, sb and gml had a similar anti-yeast activity, followed by propionic acid, while tween 80 exhibited no activity and could not enhance the anti-yeast activities of these components, and it was revealed that the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion was attributed to a combination of propionic acid, gml, and sb. the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion was in good agreement with the leakage of 260-nm absorbing materials and the observation of transmission electron microscopy, indicating that the microemulsion induced the disruption and dysfunction of the cell membrane. some microemulsions and nanoemulsions may have antimicrobial properties and be effective anti-biofilm agents. we examined the abilities of two fine emulsions, designated bctp and teop, to inactivate suspensions of vegetative cells of salmonella spp. escherichia coli 0157:h7 (vt-), pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes. bctp is an o/w nanoemulsion of soybean oil and tri-n-butyl phosphate emulsified with triton x-100, while teop is an o/w microemulsion of ethyl oleate with tween 80 as emulsifier and n-pentanol as a co-emulsifier. bctp was effective in reducing the cell numbers of l. monocytogenes, while teop was effective against all five organisms investigated. the abilities of these emulsions to reduce preformed biofilms of the five bacteria were also investigated. with the exception of the biofilm formed by l. monocytogenes, which surprisingly was not significantly affected by bctp, all biofilms were inhibited by both bctp and teop.
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) is the advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) that sets the stage for further liver damage. the mechanism for the progression of nash involves multiple parallel hits, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and others. manipulation of any of these pathways may be an approach to prevent nash development and progression. arachidyl‐amido cholanoic acid (aramchol) is presently in a phase iib nash study. the aim of the present study was to investigate aramchol's mechanism of action and its effect on fibrosis using the methionine‐ and choline‐deficient (mcd) diet model of nash. we collected liver and serum from mice fed an mcd diet containing 0.1% methionine (0.1mcd) for 4 weeks; these mice developed steatohepatitis and fibrosis. we also collected liver and serum from mice receiving a control diet, and metabolomes and proteomes were determined for both groups. the 0.1mcd‐fed mice were given aramchol (5 mg/kg/day for the last 2 weeks), and liver samples were analyzed histologically. aramchol administration reduced features of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in 0.1mcd‐fed mice. aramchol down‐regulated stearoyl‐coenyzme a desaturase 1, a key enzyme involved in triglyceride biosynthesis and the loss of which enhances fatty acid β‐oxidation. aramchol increased the flux through the transsulfuration pathway, leading to a rise in glutathione (gsh) and the gsh/oxidized gsh ratio, the main cellular antioxidant that maintains intracellular redox status. comparison of the serum metabolomic pattern between 0.1mcd‐fed mice and patients with nafld showed a substantial overlap. conclusion: aramchol treatment improved steatohepatitis and fibrosis by 1) decreasing stearoyl‐coenyzme a desaturase 1 and 2) increasing the flux through the transsulfuration pathway maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. we also demonstrated that the 0.1mcd model resembles the metabolic phenotype observed in about 50% of patients with nafld, which supports the potential use of aramchol in nash treatment. (hepatology communications 2017;1:911–927) hepatic metabolism of methionine is the source of cysteine, the precursor of glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant in the body. methionine also is the immediate precursor of sam (s-adenosylmethionine) the key methyl donor for phosphatidylcholine synthesis required for the export of vldl (very-low-density lipoprotein) triacylglycerols (triglycerides) from the liver. we have examined the kinetics of methionine, its transmethylation and trans-sulfuration with estimates of whole body rate of protein turnover and urea synthesis in clinically stable biopsy-confirmed subjects with nash (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). subjects with nash were more insulin-resistant and had significantly higher plasma concentrations of uscrp (ultrasensitive c-reactive protein), tnfα (tumour necrosis factor α) and other inflammatory cytokines. there was no significant effect of insulin resistance and nash on whole body rate of protein turnover [phenylalanine ra (rate of appearance)] and on the rate of urea synthesis. the rates of methylation of homocysteine and transmethylation of methionine were significantly lower in nash compared with controls. there was no difference in the rate of trans-sulfuration of methionine between the two groups. enteric mixed nutrient load resulted in a significant increase in all the measured parameters of methionine kinetics. heterozygosity for mthfr (5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase) (677c→t) did not have an impact on methionine metabolism. we speculate that, as a result of oxidant stress possibly due to high fatty acid oxidation, the activity of methionine adenosyltransferase is attenuated resulting in a lower rate of transmethylation of methionine and of sam synthesis. these results are the first evidence for perturbed metabolism of methionine in nash in humans and provide a rationale for the development of targeted intervention strategies.
cognitive neuroscientists have contributed to the understanding of imitation according to their expertise. neuropsychologists first established over a century ago that lesions to the left hemisphere of right-handed individuals lead to a dramatic reduction of their ability to imitate gestures. in contrast, after frontal lobe damage, patients may experience severe difficulties in inhibiting their imitative tendency. these findings suggested that our tendency to imitate is mostly sustained by the left hemisphere and that we normally manage successfully to keep it under control. neuropsychologists went on investigating other aspects of gesture imitation. these include the existence of putative mechanisms involved in imitating different types of gestures (e.g. meaningful and meaningless or transitive and intransitive), the strategic control over these mechanisms and whether there are differences in imitation depending on the action goal or the body part used. based on neuropsychological findings, some cognitive models of gesture imitation have been forwarded, the most influential of which will be reviewed here. in particular, reference will be made to the dual route model and to accounts that associate the imitative deficit to putative degraded body representations. imitation is an important constituent of the behavioral repertoire of human beings. we use imitation for learning motor skills, for facilitating comprehension of other persons’ actions and mental states, and as a communicative reference to actions or people. although some non-human species display imitative behaviors, none of them equals the versatility and perfection of human imitation. the versatility and apparent ease of human imitation is, however, not at all self-evident when one considers the neural and cognitive transformations that must be accomplished for successful imitation. imitation of meaningless gestures poses a particular challenge for our brain, because similarity between the body of the model and one’s own body must bridge fundamental differences between the perspective and modalities of perceiving and controlling one’s own and other bodies. we analyzed the locations of left-hemisphere lesions disturbing imitation of meaningless gestures and found a clear-cut body part specificity. disturbed imitation of finger postures was associated with anterior lesions including the opercular portion of the inferior frontal gyrus, whereas disturbed imitation of hand postures was associated with posterior lesions affecting the inferior parietal lobule and temporo-parieto-occipital junction. these locations do not correspond with known somatotopic maps of motor representations. rather, they argue for an intermediate step of processing interpolated between perception and execution of gestures as has been suggested by the mirror neuron and the body part coding hypotheses.
to investigate the efficacy of diffusion‐weighted imaging (dwi) for reflecting and predicting pathological tumor response in breast cancer subtype to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nac). measurements of tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (adc), volume and diameter in assessing the response of patients with locally advanced breast cancer (labc) (n = 56) undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nact) at four time periods (before treatment and after three cycles of nact) were carried out at 1.5 t using diffusion‐weighted imaging (dwi) and mri. ten benign tumors and 15 controls were also investigated. the mr tumor response was compared with the clinical response. mean adc before treatment of malignant breast tissue was significantly lower than that of controls, disease‐free contralateral tissue of the patients, and benign lesions, and gradually increased during the course of nact. analysis of the percentage change in adc, volume and diameter after each cycle of nact between clinical responders and non‐responders showed that the change in adc after the first cycle was statistically significant compared with volume and diameter, indicating its potential in assessing early response. after the third cycle, the sensitivity for differentiating responders from non‐responders was 89% for volume and diameter and 68% for adc, and the respective specificities were 50%, 70% and 100%. a sensitivity of 84% (specificity of 60% with an accuracy of 76%) was achieved when all three variables were taken together to predict the response. a cut‐off value of adc was also calculated using receiver operator characteristics analysis to discriminate between normal, benign and malignant breast tissue. similarly, a cut‐off value for adc, volume and diameter was obtained after the second and third cycles of nact to predict tumor response. the results show that adc is more useful for predicting early tumor response to nact than morphological variables, suggesting its potential in effective treatment management. copyright © 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.
discrete-time wavelet transform (dwt) is found to be better than other transforms in the time-varying system analysis, e.g. for time-varying parametric modelling [16], time-varying systems identification [17], time-varying parameter estimation [18] and time domain signal analysis [19]. in the literature the common method to analyze the time-varying system using discrete-time wavelet transform is to model the time-varying system with a time-invariant system firstly, because a general analysis of time-varying discrete-time wavelet transform (tv-dwt) is still missing. to analyze the time-varying system directly using the time-varying discrete-time wavelet transform, we need the theory for the time-varying discrete-time wavelet transform. time-varying filter banks and wavelets are studied and a design procedure is presented. in the resulting analysis-synthesis structures, the analysis filters and the corresponding synthesis filters, the number of bands, and the decimation rates can be changed with time. such structures can be considered as time-frequency overlapping block transforms. from this viewpoint, the tiling of the time-frequency plane and the corresponding basis functions are changed in time. the time-varying discrete wavelet transforms can be considered a special case of time-varying overlapping block transforms and are studied in detail. the formulation is based on the time domain formulation of time-varying analysis-synthesis structures. the design procedure can be used to design time-varying perfectly invertible transformations with a finite number of distinct analysis structures. for adaptive filter bank application, a least squares design method is also studied. >
in angiosperms, nadph: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (por) catalyzes the photoreduction of protochlorophyllide (pchlide) to chlorophyllide (chlide), the only light-dependent step in chlorophyll biosynthesis. there is a wide variety of gene organization and light- and development-dependent regulatory mechanisms for the por genes. in this study, a por homologue, designated pjporb, was isolated from pseudosasa japonica cv. akebonosuji, which is a cultivar of high ornamental value in landscape due to its unique green-white striped leaf phenotype. the full-length pjporb cdna was 1567 bp long with a 1185 bp orf that encoded 394 amino acids. multiple amino acid sequence alignment showed that the putative pjporb shared a high similarity to por homologues from other plant species, and that the cofactor (nadph)-binding motif and active site motif in particular were highly conserved among all the pors. further, pjporb was overexpressed in arabidopsisthaliana; and the pchlide contents of the genetically modified plants were reduced to a larger extent than that of wild type plants, thereby indicating its important role in pchlide photoreduction. in real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis, pjporb was expressed at higher levels in leaf samples than in culms and roots, and showed a first increasing-then decreasing expression pattern during the development of white, stripe, and green leaf samples, thus indicating its essential role in leaf development. although the mrna levels for pjporb did not differ considerably among white, stripe, and green leaf samples within the two almost same earlier developmental stages, its expression levels in the late leaf developmental stage fell into two distinct classes: high expression levels in strip and green leaf samples, and low expression levels in white leaf. collectively, these expression data suggested that pjporb may be involved in the leaf color variation for p. japonica cv. akebonosuji. during the sequencing of the genome of arabidopsis thaliana a gene has been identified that encodes a novel nadph-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (por)-like protein (accession number ac 002560). this protein has been named por c. we have expressed the por c protein in escherichia coli and have determined its in vitro activity. por c shows the characteristics of a light-dependent and nadph-requiring por similar to por a and por b. the expression of the por c gene differs markedly from that of the por a and por b genes. in contrast to the por a and por b mrnas, the por c mrna has been shown previously to accumulate only after the beginning of illumination. in light-adapted mature plants only por b and por c mrnas were detectable. the amounts of both mrnas show pronounced diurnal rhythmic fluctuations. while the oscillations of por b mrna are under the control of the circadian clock, those of por c mrna are not. another difference between por b and por c was found in seedlings that were grown under continuous white light. the concentration of por c mrna rapidly declined and soon dropped beyond the limit of detection, after these seedlings were transferred to the dark. on the other hand, por b mrna was unaffected by this light/dark shift. when seedlings were exposed to different light intensities, the amounts of por b mrna remained the same, while por a and por c mrnas were modulated in an inverse way by these light intensity changes. por a mrna was still detectable in seedlings grown under low light intensities but disappeared at higher light intensities, while the mrna concentration of por c rose with increasing light intensities. these different responses to light suggest that the functions of the three pors of arabidopsis are not completely redundant, but may allow the plant to adapt its needs for chlorophyll biosynthesis more selectively by using preferentially one of the three enzymes under a given light regime.
abstract a new approach to adaptive design of clinical trials is proposed in a general multiparameter exponential family setting, based on generalized likelihood ratio statistics and optimal sequential testing theory. these designs are easy to implement, maintain the prescribed type i error probability, and are asymptotically efficient. practical issues involved in clinical trials allowing mid-course adaptation and the large literature on this subject are discussed, and comparisons between the proposed and existing designs are presented in extensive simulation studies of their finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions. adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
purposenausea is a frequent and distressing symptom in advanced cancer patients. the objective of this retrospective study was to determine predictors of response to palliative care consultation for chronic nausea in advanced cancer outpatients.methodseligible patients included were outpatient supportive care center seen consecutively for an initial consultation and who had one follow-up visit within 30 days of the initial consultation. we reviewed the medical records of 1,273 consecutive patients, and 444 (35 %) were found to meet the eligibility criteria. all patients were assessed using the edmonton symptom assessment scale (esas). nausea response was defined as an improvement of at least 30 % between the initial visit and the first follow-up. we used logistic regression models to assess the possible predictors of improvement in nausea.resultsoverall, 112 of 444 patients (25 %) experienced moderate/severe chronic nausea (esas item score ≥4/10). higher baseline nausea intensity was significantly related to constipation (r = 0.158; p = 0.046) and all the symptoms assessed by the esas (p < 0.001). sixty-eight of the 112 (61 %) patients with moderate/severe nausea at baseline showed a significant improvement at the follow-up visit (p < 0.001). the main predictors for nausea response were improvement of fatigue (p = 0.005) and increased appetite (p = 0.003).conclusionsbaseline nausea was associated with all the esas symptom and improvement of fatigue and lack of appetite predicted a lower frequency of nausea at follow-up. more research is necessary to better understand the association between nausea severity and other symptoms and to predict which interventions will yield the best outcomes depending on the mix and severity of symptoms. the second edition of the oxford textbook of palliative medicine is a very good book, better than the first edition, being far m organized and consistent in its style. there is a wealth of info tion in its 1300 pages demonstrating the diverse nature of the needed in palliative care, however, some of the chapters ne degree of expertise to interpret them in the correct context. th not the book for those who want a ‘manual on palliative care’ book on ‘how to symptom control’. there are many excel small volumes on symptom control in patients with advan cancer. this text book is clearly a reference book. the oxford textbook of palliative medicine illustrates the distinctive skills that are needed by the palliative medicine ph cian. there are a wide range of issues covered in its 22 sec and this is to be expected in what is undoubtedly the major book of palliative care. the largest section is (as one w expect) is on symptom management with approximately 37 c ters. i found some chapters in this section frustrating since were a little pedestrian in their approach. other chapters stimulating but let down by misinformation. a good example this is the chapter on the palliation of respiratory symptoms. is an excellent chapter which reflects the expertise that the a has in this area, however, i suspect many oncologists would cize the comments made about the place and use of chemoth and radiotherapy in patients with lung cancer. in addition i fo that the discussion about the psycho-social management of b lessness was limited, which is surprising considering the sig cant body of literature that supports this approach. the chapters on disease modifying management are exc and more up-to-date than some chapters. these strong chap clinical and medical oncology are welcomed – they will undou edly be very useful to the palliative medicine physician, emp sizing the need for there to be a close collaborative wor relationship between them and the oncologist. one is always selective when reading a large textbook and cannot help but be drawn to chapters in which there is a per
rajasri is a designer fowl suitable for backyard production developed by pv narsimha rao telangana veterinary university together with poultry research station (prs), rajendranagar, hyderabad. rajasri variety is developed by crossing four different breeds (two dual type, one layer type exotic breed and local non-descript poultry were involved). it is different from other rural poultry varieties as it has a broad genetic base and introgressed with genes from local birds by incorporating desirable traits such as higher productivity (150-160 eggs per annum) compared to nondescript fowls under range conditions, compact body and long shank length for agility to avoid predation, capacity to withstand diseases and adverse climatic conditions and a truly dual purpose bird (viroji rao et al., 2012). in this study, the physical-chemical characteristics and proximate composition of the meat of of two strains of broilers (paraiso pedres and master gris plume - super pesadao, utilized for semi-intensive rearing) and cobb® strain, utilized in intensive rearing systems) were evaluated. differences related to strain and sex (males and females) were studied. cobb® broilers were slaughtered at 45 days and the other strains at 85 days. the following characteristics were evaluated in breast and thigh meat: moisture, protein, ether extract, ashes, color (ciel*a*b*), final ph, cooking loss (cl) and shear force (sf). bird strain and sex influenced breast color parameters, with cobb® presenting higher yellowness (b*) and redness (a*) means, whereas females had higher b* values and males, a* values. paraiso pedres had lower sf values. as to proximate composition, there was an interaction between strain and sex, with higher ether extract values in the meat of super pesadao males. cobb® birds presented higher lightness (l*) and b* values, and there was no effect of sex on color parameters. higher ph and sf values were found in the meat of super pesadao birds. there was an interaction between strain and sex for b* and sf values, with higher b* values obtained with cobb® males, while differences between sex, with superiority for females in the paraiso pedres strain and for males in the cobb® strain were found. increased values of sf for males were obtained for super pesadao strain. both paraiso pedres and super pesadao strains presented physicochemical and proximate composition characteristics similar to those of cobb® strain in the cuts breast and thigh so that in a few parameters, no differences between the birds kept in this two rearing systems were found.
backgroundmembers of the eph/ephrin gene families act as key regulators of cerebellar development during embryogenesis. aberrant signaling of eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands has also been implicated in human cancers. medulloblastoma is an aggressive primitive neuroectodermal tumor that originates from granule neuron precursors in the cerebellum. previous studies have suggested a role for the ephrin-a5 ligand and its receptors, epha4 and epha7, in granule cell-precursor formation and in guiding cell migration. in the present study, we investigated the effects of genetic loss of ephrin-a5, epha4, and epha7 on the spatiotemporal development of medulloblastoma tumors in the context of the smoothened transgenic mouse model system.findingsradiographic magnetic resonance imaging (mri) was performed to monitor tumor growth in a genetically engineered mouse model of medulloblastoma. tumor tissue was harvested to determine changes in the expression of phosphorylated akt by western blotting. this helped to establish a correlation between genotype and/or tumor size and survival. our in vivo data establish that in nd2-smoa1 transgenic mice, the homozygous deletion of ephrin-a5 resulted in a consistent pattern of tumor growth inhibition compared to their ephrin-a5 wild-type littermate controls, while the loss of epha4/epha7 failed to produce consistent effects versus epha4/epha7 wild-type mice. a positive correlation was evident between tumor size, p-akt, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) expression in our transgenic mouse model system, regardless of genotype.conclusionstaken together, our findings underscore the importance of targeting specific members of the eph/ephrin families in conjunction with the akt pathway in order to inhibit medulloblastoma tumor growth and progression. the eph family is thought to exert its function through the complementary expression of receptors and ligands. here, we show that epha receptors colocalize on retinal ganglion cell (rgc) axons with epha ligands, which are expressed in a high-nasal-to-low-temporal pattern. in the stripe assay, only temporal axons are normally sensitive for repellent axon guidance cues of the caudal tectum. however, overexpression of ephrina ligands on temporal axons abolishes this sensitivity, whereas treatment with pi-plc both removes ephrina ligands from retinal axons and induces a striped outgrowth of formerly insensitive nasal axons. in vivo, retinal overexpression of ephrina2 leads to topographic targeting errors of temporal axons. these data suggest that differential ligand expression on retinal axons is a major determinant of topographic targeting in the retinotectal projection.
the existing dti studies have suggested that white matter damage constitutes an important part of the neurodegenerative changes in alzheimer’s disease (ad). the present study aimed to identify the regional covariance patterns of microstructural white matter changes associated with ad. in this study, we applied a multivariate analysis approach, independent component analysis (ica), to identify covariance patterns of microstructural white matter damage based on fractional anisotropy (fa) skeletonised images from dti data in 39 ad patients and 41 healthy controls (hcs) from the alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative database. the multivariate ica decomposed the subject-dimension concatenated fa data into a mixing coefficient matrix and a source matrix. twenty-eight independent components (ics) were extracted, and a two sample t-test on each column of the corresponding mixing coefficient matrix revealed significant ad/hc differences in ica weights for 7 ics. the covariant fa changes primarily involved the bilateral corona radiata, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the cingulum, the hippocampal commissure, and the corpus callosum in ad patients compared to hcs. our findings identified covariant white matter damage associated with ad based on dti in combination with multivariate ica, potentially expanding our understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms of ad. dti is one of the most effective mr tools for the investigation of the brain anatomy. in addition to the gray matter, histopathological studies indicate that white matter is also a good target for both the early diagnosis of ad and for monitoring disease progression, which motivates us to use dti to study ad patients in vivo. there are already a large amount of studies reporting significant differences between ad patients and controls, as well as to predict progression of disease in symptomatic non-demented individuals. application of these findings in clinical practice remains to be demonstrated.
somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration were successfully established on nitsch and nitsch (nn) medium from immature zygotic embryos of six genotypes of grapevine (vitis vinifera). the optimum hormone combinations were 1.0 mg dm−3 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d) for callus induction and 1.0 mg dm−3 α-naphthalene acetic acid (naa) + 0.5 mg dm−3 6-benzyladenine (ba) for embryos production and 0.03 mg dm−3 naa + 0.5 mg dm−3 ba for embryos conversion and plant regeneration. the frequency of somatic embryogenesis varied from 10.5 to 37.5 % among six genotypes and 15.5–42.1 % of somatic embryos converted into normal plantlets. the analysis of dna content determined by flow cytometry and chromosome counting of the regenerated plantlets clearly indicated that no ploidy changes were induced during somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration, the nuclear dna content and ploidy levels of the regenerated plants were stable and homogeneous to those of the donor plants. rapd markers were also used to evaluate the genetic fidelity of plants regenerated from somatic embryos. all rapd profiles from regenerated plants were monomorphic and similar to those of the field grown donor plants. we conclude that somaclonal variation is almost absent in our grapevine plant regeneration system. we report here the successful micropropagation of adult juniperus phoenicea l. with respective ploidy stability studies. microcuttings with axillary buds were grown on five media supplemented with different growth regulator combinations. best elongation rates were achieved on driver and kuniyuki (dkw) medium supplemented with kinetin alone or with naphthaleneacetic acid (naa), while rugini olive (om) medium stimulated the development of new branches. shoots growing on murashige and skoog (ms) medium browned and showed necrotic zones. shoots of second to fourth subcultures usually had higher elongation rates than those of the first culture. for rooting assays, half strength dkw and om media, different concentrations of growth regulators, auxin continuous exposure vs. dipping and the type of solid matrix were assessed. during rooting assays, two morphotypes were observed with one type having well developed internodes and the other showing hyperhydratation and no internode development. high rooting rates (40 %) were only obtained in the first morphotype shoots exposed for 5 min to 2.4 µm iba and then transferred to om medium without growth regulators. plants were acclimatized in pots containing a mixture of peat and perlite (3:2) in greenhouse with progressive reduction of relative humidity. a flow cytometric screening for major ploidy changes revealed no differences among the morphotypes and between them and the mother plant. also the nuclear dna content of this species was estimated for the first time using flow cytometry (2c = 24.71 pg).
renshaw cells are widely distributed in all segments of the spinal cord, but detailed morphological studies of these cells and their axonal branching patterns have only been made for lumbosacral segments. for these, a characteristic distribution of terminals was reported, including extensive collateralization within 1–2 mm of the soma, but then more restricted collaterals given off at intervals from the funicular axon. previous authors have suggested that the projections close to the soma serve inhibition of motoneurons (known to be greatest for the motor nuclei providing the renshaw cell excitation) but that the distant projections serve mainly the inhibition of other neurons. however, in thoracic segments, inhibition of motoneurons is known to occur over two to three segments (20–40 mm) from the presumed somatic locations of the renshaw cells. here, we report the first detailed morphological study of renshaw cell axons outside the lumbosacral segments, which investigated whether this different distribution of motoneuron inhibition is reflected in a different pattern of renshaw cell terminations. four renshaw cells in t7 or t8 segments were intracellularly labeled with neurobiotin in anesthetized cats and their axons traced for distances ≥6 mm from the somata. the only morphological difference detected within this distance in comparison with renshaw cells in the lumbosacral cord was a minimal taper in the funicular axons, where in the lumbosacral cord this is pronounced. patterns of termination were virtually identical to those in the lumbosacral segments, so we conclude that these patterns are unrelated to the pattern of motoneuronal inhibition. in anesthetized spontaneously breathing cats (c4-c5 deafferentation), recurrent inhibition of phrenic motoneurons was analyzed by studying either recurrent ipsps in phrenic motoneurons, or renshaw cell discharges evoked by c5 phrenic nerve stimulation. of 90 intracellularly recorded phrenic motoneurons, 7 motoneurons showed evoked recurrent ipsps with stimulation of c5 phrenic axons subthreshold for eliciting antidromic activation of the motoneuron from which intracellular recording was done. these ipsps could be reversed by imposed hyperpolarization of the motoneuron, and were of greater amplitude during inspiration than during expiration. within the phrenic nucleus, interneurons were classified as renshaw cells if they responded to c5 phrenic axon stimulation with a typical high frequency burst of potentials. reactivity of these renshaw cells was related to the respiratory cycle, number of spikes in the burst being greater during inspiration than during expiration. injection of a nicotinic cholinergic blocker (mecamylamine) decreased responses of renshaw cells but the respiratory modulation was still present. some renshaw cells (18/33) were spontaneously active during inspiration. their activity was generally maximal during the last third of inspiration. since: spontaneous activity of renshaw cells is related to the respiratory drive; persists after c7 spinal transection and after mecamylamine poisoning of the axonal recurrent pathway; and might appear before sustained phrenic activity, the assumption of a central respiratory drive impinging on the renshaw cells has to be retained.
purposemany pediatric centers admit patients following incision and drainage (i&d) of soft-tissue abscesses. the purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the same-day discharge following i&d.methodsretrospective review was performed of children aged 3 months–4 years who underwent operative i&d of an abscess followed by same-day discharge. patients receiving antibiotics within 2 weeks of presentation were excluded. treatment failure was defined as readmission or repeat procedure related to the initial abscess. statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon rank-sum and fisher’s exact tests.resultsthere were 442 procedures performed in 408 patients. mean age was 1.8 years. fever was noted in 25.8%. of those who had a white blood cell (wbc) count drawn, 59.7% had leukocytosis. mean time from procedure to discharge was 2.3 h, and 85.0% were discharged with oral antibiotics. treatment failure occurred in four (0.9%) and ten (2.3%) patients at 14 and 30 days, respectively. mean wbc count was higher in the 14-day treatment failure group (24.1 versus 16.3; p = 0.10). in patients with leukocytosis, there were 2 (1.4%) treatment failures compared to none in those without leukocytosis.conclusionsame-day discharge after i&d of abscess in diaper-age children is safe and effective. background u.s. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.   methods we conducted a randomized trial at five u.s. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. the primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.   results the median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for mrsa. in the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.1 to 11.7; p=0.005). in the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, 3.2 to 11.2; p<0.001). trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% ci, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. at 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.   conclusions in settings in which mrsa was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo.

supply chain management (scm) and business-to-business (b2b) e-commerce has attracted significant attention in recent years as the availability of a ubiquitous network linking most businesses has created new opportunities for electronic integration between firms. companies need to, however, be cognizant of the inter-organizational relationships and the requirements of business processes in their supply chain when choosing from among a wide range of communication technologies and implementation strategies. this study uses galbraith's (1973) information processing theory to examine the fit between information processing needs and information processing capabilities in an inter-organizational supply chain context and examine its impact on performance. a taxonomy of information processing needs based on interorganizational transaction characteristics, and information processing capabilities based on it use in various activities of the procurement life cycle is developed. the impact of the fit between these variables on procurement performance is examined. the study collected data on 142 products through personal interviews and surveys, used cluster analytic techniques to develop taxonomies, and anova to test the fit between needs and capabilities. the results reveal two clusters each in information processing needs and information processing capabilities. anova results show that the interactive effect of needs and capabilities has a greater effect on performance than the main effects, supporting our fit theory. originally published in the working paper series of the mit international motor vehicle program.
the medial superior olive (mso) is one of the first stages in the mammalian auditory pathway to receive inputs from both ears. mso neurons can act as exquisitely sensitive coincidence detectors and are able to detect interaural time differences with submillisecond precision [1]. due to these specializations, the mso is thought to play a critical role in spatial hearing [2].    a conspicuous feature of mso electrophysiology is the presence of large, stimulus-evoked extracellular field potentials. these field potentials, known as the auditory neurophonic, have been observed since the earliest recordings from the auditory brain stem over half a century ago [3] and remain a topic of current interest [4]. the precise generators and functional consequences of the neurophonic remain largely unknown. we study these extracellular potentials in order to gain a new vantage point from which to advance both experimental and theoretical analyses of the mso.    we begin with the assumption that postsynaptic current flow in mso neurons is the dominant generator of the brain stem auditory neurophonic. we use a biophysically-based computational model of mso neurons to simulate membrane currents [5]. to model extracellular currents, we make two idealizations. first, since mso inputs are frequency-selective and strongly phase-locked to tonal stimuli, we assume synaptic inputs are synchronous. second, since mso neurons have a distinctive bipolar morphology with cell bodies that are approximately aligned in a two-dimensional sheet, we assume there is spatial symmetry in the distribution of synaptic currents. these assumptions of synchrony and symmetry lead to reduced models that we use to analyze the generation of the neurophonic.    we first show how monolateral excitatory input, when isolated on a single dendrite, creates an extracellular current sink near the site of excitation and a distributed current source along the remainder of the neuron. simulated local field potentials share many qualitative features with published reports of the neurophonic. in particular, our model results are largely consistent with a classical description of the neurophonic as a dipole field generated by postsynaptic currents in mso neurons [3,4]. the dipole theory makes no strong predictions about the dynamics of extracellular potentials, so we investigate how additional features of mso activity – somatic inhibition, asymmetries between ipsilateral and contralateral inputs, subthreshold voltage-activated currents, bilateral inputs with varying delays – shape the evolution of the neurophonic. we conclude that an idealized model of mso neurons with symmetric and synchronous inputs provides a useful tool for studying the neurophonic. ongoing work seeks to relax these simplifying assumptions and to explore how local field potentials in the brain stem may influence the coincidence detection properties of mso cells. the superior olivary nucleus of barbiturate anesthetized cats was explored with microelectrodes. both slow wave and single unit activity was recorded to clicks, tones and noise delivered to the two...
this paper presents a novel feature extraction strategy in the time-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (dwt) for valence level detection using electroencephalography (eeg) signals. signals from different eeg electrodes are considered independently for the first time in order to find an optimum combination through different levels of wavelet coefficients based on the genetic algorithm (ga). thus, we take into consideration useful information obtained from different frequency bands of brain activity along the scalp in valence level detection, and we introduce a new set of features named the cross-level wavelet feature group (clwf). the effectiveness of this approach is strongly supported by the analytical results of experiments in which eeg signals with valence level labels were collected from 50 healthy subjects. high accuracy was achieved for both 2-level (98%) and 3-level valence detection (90%) by applying leave-one-out cross validation using a probabilistic neural network (pnn). in addition, light-weighted sets with less than half eeg recording electrodes are proposed, which can achieve a high accuracy (86% for 3-level valence detection) with offering convenience of users and reducing computational complexity. in this paper, we summarize the human emotion recognition using different set of electroencephalogram (eeg) channels using discrete wavelet transform. an audio-visual induction based protocol has been designed with more dynamic emotional content for inducing discrete emotions (disgust, happy, surprise, fear and neutral). eeg signals are collected using 64 electrodes from 20 subjects and are placed over the entire scalp using international 10-10 system. the raw eeg signals are preprocessed using surface laplacian (sl) filtering method and decomposed into three different frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) using discrete wavelet transform (dwt). we have used “db4” wavelet function for deriving a set of conventional and modified energy based features from the eeg signals for classifying emotions. two simple pattern classification methods, k nearest neighbor (knn) and linear discriminant analysis (lda) methods are used and their performances are compared for emotional states classification. the experimental results indicate that, one of the proposed features (alree) gives the maximum average classification rate of 83.26% using knn and 75.21% using lda compared to those of conventional features. finally, we present the average classification rate and subsets of emotions classification rate of these two different classifiers for justifying the performance of our emotion recognition system.
signaling cascades during adipogenesis culminate in the expression of two essential adipogenic factors, ppargamma and c/ebpalpha. here we demonstrate that the ire1alpha-xbp1 pathway, the most conserved branch of the unfolded protein response (upr), is indispensable for adipogenesis. indeed, xbp1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and 3t3-l1 cells with xbp1 or ire1alpha knockdown exhibit profound defects in adipogenesis. intriguingly, c/ebpbeta, a key early adipogenic factor, induces xbp1 expression by directly binding to its proximal promoter region. subsequently, xbp1 binds to the promoter of cebpa and activates its gene expression. the posttranscriptional splicing of xbp1 mrna by ire1alpha is required as only the spliced form of xbp1 (xbp1s) rescues the adipogenic defect exhibited by xbp1-deficient cells. taken together, our data show that the ire1alpha-xbp1 pathway plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation by acting as a critical regulator of the morphological and functional transformations during adipogenesis. the protein kinase perk couples protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) to polypeptide biosynthesis by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eif2alpha), attenuating translation initiation in response to er stress. perk is highly expressed in mouse pancreas, an organ active in protein secretion. under physiological conditions, perk was partially activated, accounting for much of the phosphorylated eif2alpha in the pancreas. the exocrine and endocrine pancreas developed normally in perk-/- mice. postnatally, er distention and activation of the er stress transducer ire1alpha accompanied increased cell death and led to progressive diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. these findings suggest a special role for translational control in protecting secretory cells from er stress.
research has suggested that altering the perceived shape and size of the body image significantly affects perception of somatic events. the current study investigated how multisensory illusions applied to the body altered tactile perception using the somatic signal detection task. thirty-one healthy volunteers were asked to report the presence or absence of near-threshold tactile stimuli delivered to the index finger under three multisensory illusion conditions: stretched finger, shrunken finger and detached finger, as well as a veridical baseline condition. both stretching and shrinking the stimulated finger enhanced correct touch detections; however, the mechanisms underlying this increase were found to be different. in contrast, the detached appearance reduced false touch reports—possibly due to reduced tactile noise, as a result of attention being directed to the tip of the finger only. these findings suggest that distorted representations of the body could have different modulatory effects on attention to touch and provide a link between perceived body representation and somatosensory decision-making. sir, there is increasing evidence that drug-free illusion therapies can be beneficial for the amelioration of chronic pain, particularly so for conditions in which some of the pain is thought to have a cortical origin. for example, mirror therapy and size reduction illusions can reduce pain in complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (crps1) patients, the majority of whom have disturbed body representations with some reporting their hand as larger than in reality [1] and others describing parts of their hand as foreshortened [2]. if cortical misrepresentation of body parts contributes to pain, then manipulating the appearance of those body parts might be a useful tool in the reduction of pain. this letter describes an exploratory experiment using unique visuo-proprioceptive illusions that manipulated the perceived size of painful and non-painful parts of the hand in an attempt to modulate pain experienced in oa.    illusions were applied using a mirage system [3] that presents real-time video capture of the actual hand from the same position and perspective as if viewing the real hand directly (fig. 1a). visual manipulations can be applied to the image such that they appear to happen to the real hand. the experimental manipulations were stretching (fig. 1b) and shrinking (fig. 1c): gently pulling or pushing on part of the hand while simultaneously elongating or shortening the image gives a strong illusion that the hand is being stretched or shortened (see supplementary material for video). control illusions included stretching and shrinking a non-painful part of the hand and visually enlarging/reducing the entire hand.        fig. 1    (a) a healthy participant having her finger stretched using mirage; examples of arthritic hands after being stretched (b) and shrunk (c) and (d) the percentage pain reduction after manipulation for painful and non-painful body parts. a direct comparison ...        a total of 20 oa sufferers [2 males; mean (s.d.) age: 70.5 (6.5) years] with clinically diagnosed arthritic pain in the hands and/or fingers for >12 months were tested. participants gave written consent in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. the study met with ethical approval from the university of nottingham school of psychology ethics committee (code: 20072010). none of the participants were pain free on the day of testing and none had used pain medication other than paracetamol. participants verbally reported their pain levels on a 21-point numerical rating scale (nrs) with 0 indicating no pain at all and 20 indicating the most unbearable pain imaginable. the scores were adjusted relative to a baseline condition of gently pulling or pushing the hand without visual manipulation. nrs ratings of pain for the painful part of the hand were taken before and after stretching or shrinking the painful and non-painful parts of the hand as well as before and after enlarging or reducing the entire hand.    overall, illusory manipulation was extremely beneficial, on average halving the reported pain in 85% of participants. some reported greater reduction in pain for stretching, some for shrinking and some for both. crucially, pain reduction was only observed when the painful part of the hand was manipulated and not when manipulating the non-painful part (fig. 1d) or when enlarging or reducing the whole hand (although the latter was only tested in a minority of participants). for those in whom stretching was beneficial, the mean reduction in pain was ∼50% (pre = 6.42 on the nrs; post = 3.33), while beneficial shrinking produced a ∼45% reduction (pre = 5.83; post = 3.15). remarkably, illusory stretching or shrinking of the painful body part temporarily eliminated all pain in one-third of all participants and in 41% of those for whom the illusion was effective. although not formally assessed, many participants spontaneously reported an increased range of movement following manipulation and most reported pain reduction before active movement was permitted. many participants gave spontaneous verbal reports such as: ‘i can feel my whole body relaxing.’; ‘my pain has completely gone.’; and ‘i wasn’t able to move like that before.’    this experiment demonstrates a strong analgesic effect of multisensory illusions for oa, which (though not tested directly) is consistent with the idea that some of the pain experienced in arthritic conditions may result from dysfunctional representations of the body [4]. furthermore, the methods described may provide a mechanism for promoting therapeutic exercise normally prevented by painful movement. the effects of mini-magnification appear to be specific to the part of the body in which the pain is experienced and do not require active movement of the hand. intriguingly, both shrinking and stretching were found to be beneficial in different, and sometimes the same, participants. this may be due to two distinct processes: the matching of cortical representations and the reduction of apparent swelling, which may vary between participants according to different physical and cortical representations. although the current experiment describes striking analgesic effects, it does not completely rule out placebo effects and more comprehensive experimental research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms and validate the beneficial effects. in particular, the effects of having attention drawn to the painful part of the hand while being manipulated must be adequately controlled for. however, these initial results suggest that multisensory illusions are a useful avenue of research for the treatment of pain in oa.        disclosure statement: the authors have declared no conflicts of interest.
the effects of 24-epibrassinolide (24-epibl) on seedling growth, antioxidative system, lipid peroxidation, proline and soluble protein content were investigated in seedlings of the salt-sensitive rice cultivar ir-28. seedling growth of rice plants was improved by 24-epibl treatment under salt stress conditions. when seedlings treated with 24-epibl were subjected to 120 mm nacl stress, the activities of superoxide dismutase (ec 1.15.1.1), catalase (ec 1.11.1.6) and glutathione reductase (ec 1.6.4.2) did not show significant difference, whereas the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (ec 1.11.1.11) significantly increased. increased activity of peroxidase (ec 1.11.1.7) under nacl stress showed remarkable decrease in the 24-epibl+nacl-applied group. lipid peroxidation level significantly increased under salt stress but decreased with 24-epibl application revealing that less oxidative damage occurred in this group (24-epibl+nacl). in addition, increased proline content in the nacl-applied group was decreased by 24-epibl application in the 24-epibl+nacl-applied group. soluble protein content was increased by 24-epibl application even under nacl stress, being also higher than control conditions (no 24-epibl or nacl treatment). 24-epibl treatment considerably alleviated oxidative damage that occurred under nacl-stressed conditions and improved seedling growth in part under salt stress in sensitive ir-28 seedlings. we examined the effects of brassinosteroids on arabidopsis thaliana (l.) henyh. ecotype columbia in order to develop a model system for studying gene regulation by plant steroids. submicromolar concentrations of two brassinosteroids, brassinolide and 24-epibrassinolide, stimulated elongation of arabidopsis peduncles and inhibited root elongation, respectively. furthermore, brassinolide altered the abundance of specific in vitro translatable mrnas from peduncles and whole plants of arabidopsis. root elongation in the auxin-insensitive arabidopsis mutant axr1 was inhibited by 24-epibrassinolide but not by 2,4-d, indicating an independent mode of action for these growth regulators in this physiological response.
body mass index (bmi) is often used as a surrogate estimate of percent body fat in epidemiological studies. this study tested the hypothesis that bmi is representative of body fatness independent of age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic location in prepubertal children. the study sample included a total of 605 prepubertal children (275 girls and 330 boys) of which 247 were chinese from jinan, shandong, mainland china, and 358 children were from various ethnic backgrounds in new york city (nyc): 121 caucasians, 94 african americans, and 143 asians (chinese and korean). in this cross-sectional study, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to quantify total body fat (tbf) and percent body fat (pbf). prepubertal status was assessed by the criteria of tanner. multiple regression models were developed with tbf and pbf as the dependent variables and bmi, age, sex, and ethnicity as independent variables. multiple regression analysis showed that bmi alone explained 85% and 69% of between-subject variance for tbf and pbf, respectively. sex was a significant contributor to the models (p<0.001) with girls having higher tbf and pbf than boys. ethnicity and geographic location were significant contributors to the model (p<0.0001) with asians (jinan and nyc asians) having higher pbf than all non-asian groups (p<0.0001), and jinan asians having higher tbf and pbf than nyc-asians. among prepubertal children, for the same bmi, asians have significantly higher pbf compared with african americans and caucasians. caution is warranted when applying bmi across sex and ethnic prepubertal groups. objectives to test the hypothesis that in a healthy pediatric population body mass index (bmi) (kilograms per meter square) is a valid measure of fatness that is independent of age for both sexes.   methods total body fat (tbf) (in kilograms) and percent of body weight as fat (pbf) were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) in 198 healthy italian children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age. we developed multiple regression analysis models with tbf and percent body fat as dependent variables and bmi, age, and interaction terms as independent variables. separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls.   results bmi was strongly associated with tbf (r2 = 0.85 and 0.89 for boys and girls, respectively) and pbf (r2 =0.63 and 0.69 for boys and girls, respectively). confidence limits on bmi-fatness association were wide, with individuals of similar bmi showing large differences in tbf and in pbf. age was a significant covariate in all regression models. addition of nonlinear terms for bmi did not substantially increase the r2 for tbf and pbf models in boys and girls.   conclusion our results support the use of bmi as a fatness measure in groups of children and adolescents, although interpretation should be cautious when comparing bmi across groups that differ in age or when predicting a specific individual's tbf or pbf.
the objective was to investigate the genotypic characteristics and distribution of staphylococcus aureus in 9 dairy herds of tabriz and urmia regions which are located in east and west azerbaijan provinces, respectively, iran. in this study 58 s. aureus isolates were recovered from 370 milk samples of cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis. s. aureus isolates were identified on the basis of the cultural and biochemical properties as well as by amplification of the aroa gene specific to s. aureus and then were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the coagulase gene (coa). amplification of the variable region of the coa gene from these isolates produced five different pcr products ranging in size from approximately 490 bp to 850 bp. to obtain rflp patterns of the pcr products they were subjected to digestion with restriction endonuclease haeiii and the fragments separated by gel electrophoresis. nine coa gene rflp patterns, numbered i-ix, were observed, with 23 isolates (39.66%) assigned to rflp pattern i and 14 isolates (24.14%) assigned to rflp pattern iii. five out of nine patterns were found in both regions and four of nine patterns were only found in one region. the results demonstrated that several variants of the coa gene are present in the studied regions, but only a few of them were predominant, suggesting contagious transmission, a common source, or host adaptation of subset of the population of s. aureus strains. this study also indicated that genetic heterogeneity among s. aureus isolates recovered from bovine mastitis may be exists within and among herds in different regions. abstract in the present study, 103 staphylococcus aureusstrains isolated from milk samples from 60 cows with mastitis from eight different farms in seven different locations in one region of germany were compared pheno- and genotypically and by identification of various toxins. on the basis of culture and hemolytic properties and by determination of the tube coagulase reaction, all of the isolates could be identified as s. aureus. this could be confirmed by pcr amplification of species-specific parts of the gene encoding the 23s rrna. in addition, all of the s. aureus isolates harbored the genes encoding staphylococcal coagulase and clumping factor and the genes encoding the x region and the immunoglobulin g binding region of protein a. these four genes displayed size polymorphisms. by pcr amplification, the genes for the toxins staphylococcal enterotoxin a (sea), sec, sed, seg, sei, sej, and tsst-1 but not those for seb, see, seh, and the exfoliative toxins eta and etb could be detected. to analyze the epidemiological relationships, the isolates were subjected to dna fingerprinting by macrorestriction analysis of their chromosomal dnas. according to the observed gene polymorphisms, the toxin patterns, and the information given by macrorestriction analysis of the isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a limited number of clones seemed to be responsible for the cases of bovine mastitis on the various farms.
selective attention is often accompanied by gamma oscillations in local field potentials and spike field coherence in brain areas related to visual, motor, and cognitive information processing. gamma oscillations are implicated to play an important role in, for example, visual tasks including object search, shape perception, and speed detection. however, the mechanism by which gamma oscillations enhance cognitive and behavioral performance of attentive subjects is still elusive. using feedforward fan-in networks composed of spiking neurons, we examine a possible role for gamma oscillations in selective attention and population rate coding of external stimuli. we implement the concept proposed by fries (2005) that under dynamic stimuli, neural populations effectively communicate with each other only when there is a good phase relationship among associated gamma oscillations. we show that the downstream neural population selects a specific dynamic stimulus received by an upstream population and represents it by population rate coding. the encoded stimulus is the one for which gamma rhythm in the corresponding upstream population is resonant with the downstream gamma rhythm. the proposed role for gamma oscillations in stimulus selection is to enable top-down control, a neural version of time division multiple access used in communication engineering. we describe a simple computational model, based on generic features of cortical local circuits, that links cholinergic neuromodulation, gamma rhythmicity, and attentional selection. we propose that cholinergic modulation, by reducing adaptation currents in principal cells, induces a transition from asynchronous spontaneous activity to a "background" gamma rhythm (resembling the persistent gamma rhythms evoked in vitro by cholinergic agonists) in which individual principal cells participate infrequently and irregularly. we suggest that such rhythms accompany states of preparatory attention or vigilance and report simulations demonstrating that their presence can amplify stimulus-specific responses and enhance stimulus competition within a local circuit.
we examined the effect of angiotensin ii (ang ii) on epithelial na(+) channel (enac) in the rat cortical collecting duct (ccd) with single-channel and the perforated whole cell patch-clamp recording. application of 50 nm ang ii increased enac activity, defined by np(o) (a product of channel numbers and open probability), and the amiloride-sensitive whole cell na currents by twofold. the stimulatory effect of ang ii on enac was absent in the presence of losartan, suggesting that the effect of ang ii on enac was mediated by ang ii type 1 receptor. moreover, depletion of intracellular ca(2+) with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid (bapta)-am failed to abolish the stimulatory effect of ang ii on enac but inhibiting protein kinase c (pkc) abolished the effect of ang ii, suggesting that the effect of ang ii was the result of stimulating ca(2+)-independent pkc. this notion was also suggested by the experiments in which stimulation of pkc with phorbol ester derivative mimicked the effect of ang ii and increased amiloride-sensitive na currents in the principal cell, an effect that was not abolished by treatment of the ccd with bapta-am. also, inhibition of nadph oxidase (nox) with diphenyleneiodonium chloride abolished the stimulatory effect of ang ii on enac and application of superoxide donors, pyrogallol or xanthine and xanthine oxidase, significantly increased enac activity. moreover, addition of ang ii or h(2)o(2) diminished the arachidonic acid (aa)-induced inhibition of enac in the ccd. we conclude that ang ii stimulates enac in the ccd through a ca(2+)-independent pkc pathway that activates nox thereby increasing superoxide generation. the stimulatory effect of ang ii on enac may be partially the result of blocking aa-induced inhibition of enac. angiotensin ii (angii) is an important mediator in renal injury. accumulating evidence suggests that angii stimulates intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ros) such as the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. angii activates several subunits of the membrane-bound multicomponent nad(p)h oxidase and also increases ros formation in the mitochondria. some of these effects may be induced by aldosterone and not directly by angii. the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide influence other downstream signaling pathways, such as transcription factors, tyrosine kinases/phosphatases, ion channels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. through these signaling pathways, ros have distinct functional effects on renal cells. they are transducers of cell growth, apoptosis, and cell migration and affect expression of inflammatory and extracellular matrix genes. for example, angii-mediated expression of p27(kip1), a cell-cycle regulatory protein, and induction of tubular hypertrophy depend on the generation of ros. the effects of ros generated within different renal cells ultimately depend on the locally generated concentrations and the balance of pro- and antioxidant pathways. although the concept that angii mediates oxidative stress in the kidney has been validated in experimental models, the exact role is still incompletely understood in human renal diseases.
backgroundheterogeneously distributed hypoxic areas are a characteristic property of locally advanced breast cancers (bca) and generally associated with therapeutic resistance, metastases, and poor patient survival. about 50% of locally advanced bca, where radiotherapy is less effective are suggested to be due to hypoxic regions. in this study, we investigated the potential of bioactive phytochemicals in radio-sensitizing hypoxic bca cells.methodshypoxic (o2-2.5%; n2-92.5%; co2-5%) mcf-7 cells were exposed to 4 gy radiation (ir) alone or after pretreatment with curcumin (cur), curcumin analog ef24, neem leaf extract (nle), genistein (gen), resveratrol (res) or raspberry extract (rse). the cells were examined for inhibition of nfκb activity, transcriptional modulation of 88 nfκb signaling pathway genes, activation and cellular localization of radio-responsive nfκb related mediators, enos, erk1/2, sod2, akt1/2/3, p50, p65, piκbα, tnfα, birc-1, -2, -5 and associated induction of cell death.resultsemsa revealed that cells exposed to phytochemicals showed complete suppression of ir-induced nfκb. relatively, cells exposed ef24 revealed a robust inhibition of ir-induced nfκb. qpcr profiling showed induced expression of 53 nfκb signaling pathway genes after ir. conversely, 53, 50, 53, 53, 53 and 53 of ir-induced genes were inhibited with ef24, nle, cur, gen, res and rse respectively. in addition, 25, 29, 24, 16, 11 and 21 of 35 ir-suppressed genes were further inhibited with ef24, nle, cur, gen, res and rse respectively. immunoblotting revealed a significant attenuating effect of ir-modulated radio-responsive enos, erk1/2, sod2, akt1/2/3, p50, p65, piκbα, tnfα, birc-1, -2 and −5 with ef24, nle, cur, gen, res or rse. annexin v-fitc staining showed a consistent and significant induction of ir-induced cell death with these phytochemicals. notably, ef24 robustly conferred ir-induced cell death.conclusionstogether, these data identifies the potential hypoxic cell radio-sensitizers and further implies that the induced radio-sensitization may be exerted by selectively targeting ir-induced nfκb signaling. purpose we recently reported that curcumin attenuates ionizing radiation (ir)-induced survival signaling and proliferation in human neuroblastoma cells. also, in the endothelial system, we have demonstrated that nfκb regulates ir-induced telomerase activity (ta). accordingly, we investigated the effect of curcumin in inhibiting ir-induced nfκb-dependent htert transcription, ta, and cell survival in neuroblastoma cells.   methods and materials sk-n-mc or sh-sy5y cells exposed to ir and treated with curcumin (10-100 nm) with or without ir were harvested after 1 h through 24 h. nfκb-dependent regulation was investigated either by luciferase reporter assays using pnfκb-, pgl3-354-, pgl3-347-, or puse-iκbα-luc, p50/p65, or rela sirna-transfected cells. nfκb activity was analyzed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and htert expression using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. ta was determined using the telomerase repeat amplification protocol assay and cell survival using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltertrazolium bromide and clonogenic assay.   results curcumin profoundly inhibited ir-induced nfκb. consequently, curcumin significantly inhibited ir-induced ta and htert mrna at all points investigated. furthermore, ir-induced ta is regulated at the transcriptional level by triggering telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter activation. moreover, nfκb becomes functionally activated after ir and mediates ta upregulation by binding to the κb-binding region in the promoter region of the tert gene. consistently, elimination of the nfκb-recognition site on the telomerase promoter or inhibition of nfκb by the iκbα mutant compromises ir-induced telomerase promoter activation. significantly, curcumin inhibited ir-induced tert transcription. consequently, curcumin inhibited htert mrna and ta in nfκb overexpressed cells. furthermore, curcumin enhanced the ir-induced inhibition of cell survival.   conclusions these results strongly suggest that curcumin inhibits ir-induced ta in an nfκb dependent manner in human neuroblastoma cells.
this study introduces a conceptually based, systematic evaluation process employing multivariate techniques to evaluate a multidisciplinary social work–lawyer intervention model (jasa-leap). logistic regression analyses were used with a random sample of case records (n = 250) from three intervention sites. client retention, program fidelity, and exposure to multidisciplinary services were significantly related to reduction in mistreatment risk at case closure. female gender, married status, and living with perpetrator significantly predicted unfavorable outcomes. this study extends the elder mistreatment program evaluation literature beyond descriptive/bivariate evaluation strategies. findings suggest that a multidisciplinary social work–lawyer elder mistreatment intervention model is a successful approach. this study compared 2 approaches to the assessment of adult protective services (aps) cases. using administrative data from 869 cases in 2 counties in maryland, the differences between a nurse/social worker team and a lone social worker in case disposition, risk reduction, recidivism, and cost effectiveness were examined. lone social workers were significantly more likely to confirm financial exploitation, physical abuse, and neglect by others; while the team approach resulted in significantly greater risk reduction. no differences were observed in relation to recidivism, self-neglect and cost savings. given limited resources, research that examines optimal staffing patterns in aps agencies is warranted.
when programming movement, one must account for gravitational acceleration. this is particularly important when catching a falling object because the task requires a precise estimate of time-to-contact. knowledge of gravity’s effects is intimately linked to our definition of ‘up’ and ‘down’. both directions can be described in an allocentric reference frame, based on visual and/or gravitational cues, or in an egocentric reference frame in which the body axis is taken as vertical. to test which frame humans use to predict gravity’s effect, we asked participants to intercept virtual balls approaching from above or below with artificially controlled acceleration that could be congruent or not with gravity. to dissociate between these frames, subjects were seated upright (trunk parallel to gravity) or lying down (body axis orthogonal to the gravitational axis). we report data in line with the use of an allocentric reference frame and discuss its relevance depending on available gravity-related cues. prevailing views on how we time the interception of a moving object assume that the visual inputs are informationally sufficient to estimate the time-to-contact from the object's kinematics. here we present evidence in favor of a different view: the brain makes the best estimate about target motion based on measured kinematics and an a priori guess about the causes of motion. according to this theory, a predictive model is used to extrapolate time-to-contact from expected dynamics (kinetics). we projected a virtual target moving vertically downward on a wide screen with different randomized laws of motion. in the first series of experiments, subjects were asked to intercept this target by punching a real ball that fell hidden behind the screen and arrived in synchrony with the visual target. subjects systematically timed their motor responses consistent with the assumption of gravity effects on an object's mass, even when the visual target did not accelerate. with training, the gravity model was not switched off but adapted to nonaccelerating targets by shifting the time of motor activation. in the second series of experiments, there was no real ball falling behind the screen. instead the subjects were required to intercept the visual target by clicking a mousebutton. in this case, subjects timed their responses consistent with the assumption of uniform motion in the absence of forces, even when the target actually accelerated. overall, the results are in accord with the theory that motor responses evoked by visual kinematics are modulated by a prior of the target dynamics. the prior appears surprisingly resistant to modifications based on performance errors.
statins are cholesterol reduction agents that exhibit anti-cancer activity in several human cancers. because autophagy is a crucial survival mechanism for cancer cells under stress conditions, cooperative inhibition of autophagy acts synergistically with other anti-cancer drugs. thus, this study investigates whether combined treatment of atorvastatin and autophagy inhibitors results in enhancing the cytotoxic effects of atorvastatin, upon human bladder cancer cells, t24 and j82, in vitro. to measure cell viability, we performed the ez-cytox cell viability assay. we examined apoptosis by flow cytometry using annexin-v/propidium iodide (pi and western blot using procaspase-3 and poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) antibodies. to examine autophagy activation, we evaluated the co-localization of lc3 and lysotracker by immunocytochemistry, as well as the expression of lc3 and p62/sequestosome-1 (sqstm1) by western blot. in addition, we assessed the survival and proliferation of t24 and j82 cells by a clonogenic assay. we found that atorvastatin reduced the cell viability of t24 and j82 cells via apoptotic cell death and induced autophagy activation, shown by the co-localization of lc3 and lysotracker. moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy significantly enhanced atorvastatin-induced apoptosis in t24 and j82 cells. in sum, inhibition of autophagy potentiates atorvastatin-induced apoptotic cell death in human bladder cancer cells in vitro, providing a potential therapeutic approach to treat bladder cancer. to the editor: the intravesical administration of bacille calmette–guerin (bcg) vaccine for high-risk, non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer and carcinoma in situ is one of the most successful immunot...
objective: to explore the extent to which the reported unfavorable fatty acid content of abdominal depots in adults is also true for children. in addition, the present study aims to assess the relative importance of abdominal vs buttock adipose tissue fat in the prediction of serum lipid levels in children.design: a cross-sectional study of children from the island of crete.setting: the study was conducted between october 1999 and january 2000 in the municipality of st nikolas, crete.subjects: a total of 475 children (aged 11–18) participated in the study. data were obtained on children's anthropometry, serum lipids, physical activity and abdominal and buttock adipose tissue fatty acids. in total 138 children (aged 11–16) had complete data in all of the variables studied.results: abdominal depots have elevated proportions of saturated fatty acids (p<0.001) and trans fatty acids (p<0.001), and reduced proportions of monounsaturated (p<0.001) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (p<0.001) in comparison to buttock depots. buttock adipose tissue monounsaturated fat correlated negatively to serum ldl-c (p<0.05). abdominal adipose tissue polyunsaturated fat had negative correlations with serum total cholesterol (p<0.05) and ldl-c (p<0.05). regression analyses indicated that children's serum total cholesterol (p<0.05) and ldl-c (p<0.05) were inversely related to abdominal adipose tissue polyunsaturated fat. body mass index was positively related to serum triglycerides (p<0.01) and ldl-c (p<0.01), and negatively to serum hdl-c (p<0.05). age was negatively related to serum hdl-c (p<0.05).conclusions: it appears that, similar to adults, children's fatty acid composition of abdominal adipose tissue is less favorable than that of the buttock. abdominal depots have elevated proportions of saturated fatty acids and reduced proportions of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat in comparison to buttock depots. moreover, children's abdominal depots appear to have higher trans fatty acid contents than buttock depots. children's adipose polyunsaturated fat, a biomarker of long-term polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, is inversely related to serum total cholesterol and ldl-c. it appears that abdominal adipose tissue fatty acids are more strongly related to serum lipids than buttock adipose tissue fatty acids. this may be attributed to the reported higher lipolysis rates in abdominal as opposed to buttock depots.sponsorship: funding was provided by the municipality of st nikolas, crete, greece. we compared the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue from three different sites, one deep-seated site (perirenal) and two subcutaneous sites (abdominal and buttock), in 143 autopsied adult humans aged 24-61 y. the proportion of saturated fatty acids was highest in the perirenal adipose tissue and lowest in buttock adipose tissue. the proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids in the three sites were in the reverse order. linoleic and linolenic acids were similar in the three adipose-tissue sites, an important finding for those concerned about the essential fatty acids, which are solely derived from the diet. the results clearly show that the fatty acid composition of the two subcutaneous fat depots differ significantly. we conclude that abdominal fat is more saturated than buttock fat.
backgroundprotein kinase c (pkc) dysfunction is implicated in a variety of smooth muscle disorders including detrusor overactivity associated with frequency and urgency of micturition. in this study, we aimed to evaluate the modulatory effects of endogenous pkc-dependent pathways on bladder storage and emptying function.methodswe utilized in vivo cystometry and in vitro organ bath studies using isolated bladder muscle strips (bms) from rats to measure contractility, intravesical pressure, and voided volume. both in vitro and in vivo results were statistically analyzed using one-way repeated measures anova between the groups followed by bonferroni’s post-test, as appropriate (systat software inc., san jose, ca).resultseffects of pkc activators, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu), and phorbol-12,13-myristate (pma), were concentration-dependent, with high concentrations increasing frequency of micturition, and sensitivity of intramural nerves to electrical field stimulation (efs), in vitro, while lower concentrations had no effect on bms sensitivity to efs. the pkc inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimide1 (bim-1), (28 nm), and ro318220 (50 μm) triggered an increase in the number of non-voiding contractions (nvc), and a decrease in the voided volume associated with reduced ability to maintain contractile force upon efs, but did not affect peak force in vitro. both low (50 nm) and high pdbu 1 micromolar (1um) decreased the sensitivity of bms to carbachol. application of a low concentration of pdbu inhibited spontaneous contractions, in vitro, and bim-1-induced nvc, and restored normal voiding frequency during urodynamic recordings in vivo.conclusionsin summary, the effects of low pkc stimulation include inhibition of smooth muscle contractile responses, whereas high levels of pkc stimulation increased nerve-mediated contractions in vitro, and micturition contractions in vivo. these results indicate that endogenous pkc signaling displays a concentration-dependent contraction profile in the urinary bladder via both smooth muscle and nerve-mediated pathways. purpose we evaluate the role of protein kinase c in excitatory purinergic neurotransmission in the mouse bladder.   materials and methods in isolated mouse detrusor strips contractile responses to electrical field stimulation were mostly mediated by neural released acetylcholine and adenosine triphosphate (atp). the changes in neurotransmission were measured indirectly by recording the contraction of detrusor strips in response to repetitive electrical field stimulation by trains of electrical pulses at 8 hz. 1 second in duration.   results a protein kinase c activator, 1 to 2.5 nm. (beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (beta-pdbu), but not the inactive form alpha-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, significantly enhanced neurogenic detrusor contractions. the purinergic component of the evoked detrusor contractions in the presence of atropine was specifically sensitive to this enhancing effect by beta-pdbu but the cholinergic component in the alpha,beta-methylene atp treated detrusors remained unaffected. this enhancing effect of beta-pdbu was dependent on the extracellular calcium (ca2+) concentration. a p and/or q type ca2+ channel blocker, 0.1 and 0.3 microm. omega-conotoxin-mviic, and protein kinase c inhibitors, 0.3 and 1 microm. staurosporine and 0.3 and 1 microm. bisindolylmaleimide i but not 0.1 and 0.3 microm. omega-conotoxin-gvia, an n type ca2+ channel blocker, abolished the effect of beta-pdbu. moreover, beta-pdbu did not affect the muscle responses induced by the exogenous agonists carbachol or alpha,beta-methylene atp and potassium chloride.   conclusions these results suggest that the activation of ca2+ channel, especially the p and/or q type, may be involved in the enhancing effect of protein kinase c activator beta-pdbu on muscle contractions elicited by excitatory purinergic neurotransmission in the mouse detrusor strips.
our previous research indicated that an internet intervention was effective in increasing self-reported physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis (ms). the present study examined the efficacy of the same internet intervention in persons with ms by using both objective and self-report measures of physical activity. participants (n = 21) wore an accelerometer around the waist for 7 days and then completed the international physical activity questionnaire (ipaq) and godin leisure-time exercise questionnaire (glteq) before and after receiving the 12-week internet intervention. the internet intervention resulted in moderate increases in accelerometer activity counts (d = 0.68) and steps counts (d = 0.60), and this was paralleled by small increases in ipaq (d = 0.43) and glteq (d = 0.34) scores. the number of weeks that persons logged on was correlated with change in accelerometer activity counts (r = 0.42) and step counts (r = 0.37) but not change in ipaq (r = 0.10) or glteq (r = 0.08) scores. the novel contribution of this study was the observation that an internet intervention was efficacious for increasing physical activity in persons with ms by using both objective and self-report measures. background:physical activity has been associated with improvements in walking mobility and quality of life in persons with multiple sclerosis (ms), and yet this population is largely sedentary and inactive compared with the general population. objectives:we conducted a pilot, randomized controlled trial (rct) for examining the effect of an internet intervention based on social cognitive theory (sct) for favorably increasing physical activity among persons with ms. we further examined variables from sct as possible mediators of the internet intervention. methods:we randomly allocated 54 persons with ms into either an internet intervention condition or a waitlist control condition. the participants completed measures of physical activity, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, functional limitations, and goal setting before and after the 12-week period. results:the intervention group reported a statistically significant (p = 0.01) and large increase in physical activity over time (d = 0.72), whereas the control group had a small (d = 0.04) and non-significant change in physical activity (p = 0.71). the intervention group further reported a statistically significant (p = 0.001) and large increase in goal setting over time (d = 0.97), whereas the control group had a small (d = −0.13) and non-significant change (p = 0.17). the change in goal setting over time mediated the effect of the internet intervention on physical activity behavior. conclusions:this pilot study sets the stage for a subsequent rct that includes a larger sample of persons with ms, longer intervention period along with a follow-up, objective measure of physical activity, and secondary outcomes of walking mobility and qol.
backgroundmany of the currently used models of bacterial meningitis have limitations due to direct inoculation of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid or brain and a relatively insensitive assessment of long-term sequelae. the present study evaluates the utility of a streptococcus (s.) suis intranasal infection model for the investigation of experimental therapies in meningitis.methodswe examined the brains of 10 piglets with s. suis meningitis as well as 14 control piglets by histology, immunohistochemistry and in-situ tailing for morphological alterations in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and microglial activation in the neocortex.resultsin piglets with meningitis, the density of apoptotic neurons was significantly higher than in control piglets. moreover, scoring of microglial morphology revealed a significant activation of these cells during meningitis. the slight increase in the density of dividing cells, young neurons and microglia observed in piglets suffering from meningitis was not statistically significant, probably because of the short time frame between onset of clinical signs and organ sampling.conclusionsthe morphological changes found during s. suis meningitis are in accordance with abnormalities in other animal models and human autopsy cases. therefore, the pig should be considered as a model for evaluating effects of experimental therapeutic approaches on neurological function in bacterial meningitis. backgroundbacteremia and systemic complications both play important roles in brain pathophysiological alterations and the outcome of pneumococcal meningitis. their individual contributions to the development of brain damage, however, still remain to be defined.methodsusing an adult rat pneumococcal meningitis model, the impact of bacteremia accompanying meningitis on the development of hippocampal injury was studied. the study comprised of the three groups: i. meningitis (n = 11), ii. meningitis with attenuated bacteremia resulting from iv injection of serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies (n = 14), and iii. uninfected controls (n = 6).resultspneumococcal meningitis resulted in a significantly higher apoptosis score 0.22 (0.18-0.35) compared to uninfected controls (0.02 (0.00-0.02), mann whitney test, p = 0.0003). also, meningitis with an attenuation of bacteremia by antibody treatment resulted in significantly reduced apoptosis (0.08 (0.02-0.20), p = 0.01) as compared to meningitis.conclusionsour results demonstrate that bacteremia accompanying meningitis plays an important role in the development of hippocampal injury in pneumococcal meningitis.
the aim of study was to evaluate efficacy of extracted chondroitin sulfate (cs) from chick en keel cartilages, its comparison with standard cs from shark origin alone and in co mbination with glucosamine sulfate (gs) in developed and standardized papain induced osteoarthritis (oa) rat model. control group (normal) received sterile normal saline solution while experimental group's papain intra-articularly. induction of oa in relation to time was assessed on the basis of histological lesions scores. statistical mean histological lesion s score on 28 th day of post papain injection in oa rats was 12.82±1.64. on the basis of data obtained, 29 th day of post papain injection was decided as cut off point for starting the therapy for oa. efficacy of treatments among control and oa groups (un -treated and treated) was assessed on the basis of histological le sions scores. treatments started from 29 th day were continued till 60 th day of post papain injection. histological lesion s score was not reduced in cartilages of un -treated oa group. in treated groups, structural changes reduced and were found to be close to the normal (control) group. highest histological lesions score was observed in un-treated oa group followed by gs treated, standard cs, extracted cs, extracted cs plus gs and standard cs plus gs. maximum reduction in histological lesions score was noted in groups treated with combinations. histological lesions score of group treated with standard cs (shark) was not significantly different from extracted cs (chicken) alone and extracted cs plus gs. cs extracted from chicken keel cartilages proved to be ef fective in reducing oa progression. extracted cs in combination with gs was comparable with standard cs plus gs in efficacy. chicken keel cartilage is found to be easily available and potential source of cs that may be used as therapeutic agent in oa. objective to examine the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate (cs) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (oa) on the basis of a metaanalysis of controlled clinical trials.   methods after personal, medline, and embase searches, a decision tree analysis of the available publications was performed, with respect to types of joint involvement studied, study designs, numbers of patients enrolled, and variables analyzed. the lequesne index and pain rating on visual analog scale (vas) were considered the main variables. of a total of 16 publications found, 7 trials of 372 patients taking cs could be enrolled into the metaanalysis. although all selected studies claimed to be randomized, double blind designs in parallel groups, it should be noted that cs was given along with analgesics or nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs, making required dosage of comedication an important factor.   results following patients to 120 or more days, cs was shown to be significantly superior to placebo with respect to the lequesne index and pain vas. pooled data confirmed these results and showed at least 50% improvement in the study variables in the cs group compared to placebo.   conclusion cs may be useful in oa, but further investigations in larger cohorts of patients for longer time periods are needed to prove its usefulness as a symptom modifying drug in oa.
nematostella vectensis is an infaunal anemone occurring in salt marshes, lagoons and other estuarine habitats in north america and the united kingdom. although it is considered rare and receives protection in england, it is widely distributed and abundant in the united states, particularly along the atlantic coast. recent studies suggest that both anthropogenic dispersal and reproductive plasticity may significantly influence the genetic structure of n. vectensis populations. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting of individuals from nine populations in the northeastern united states indicates that stable populations are maintained by both asexual and sexual reproduction; in some cases asexually reproducing lineages exist within sexually reproducing populations. f statistics reveal extraordinarily high degrees of genetic differentiation between populations, even those separated by very short distances (less than 100 m). genetic distances show little to no correlation with geographical distances, consistent with a role for sporadic, geographically discontinuous dispersal coupled with limited gene flow. no single genotype was found at more than one site, despite apparent homogeneity of habitat. in contrast with reported genotypic distributions for nematostella in the united kingdom, where a single clonal genotype dominates at multiple sites through southern england, our data thus fail to support the hypothesis of a general‐purpose genotype in the northeastern united states. however, they are consistent with important roles for reproductive plasticity, sporadic introductions and complex local population dynamics in determining the global and regional distribution of this species. molecular markers derived from polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of genomic dna are an important part of the toolkit of evolutionary geneticists. random amplified polymorphic dna markers (rapds), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (aflps) and intersimple sequence repeat (issr) polymorphisms allow analysis of species for which previous dna sequence information is lacking, but dominance makes it impossible to apply standard techniques to calculate f‐statistics. we describe a bayesian method that allows direct estimates of fst from dominant markers. in contrast to existing alternatives, we do not assume previous knowledge of the degree of within‐population inbreeding. in particular, we do not assume that genotypes within populations are in hardy–weinberg proportions. our estimate of fst incorporates uncertainty about the magnitude of within‐population inbreeding. simulations show that samples from even a relatively small number of loci and populations produce reliable estimates of fst. moreover, some information about the degree of within‐population inbreeding (fis) is available from data sets with a large number of loci and populations. we illustrate the method with a reanalysis of rapd data from 14 populations of a north american orchid, platanthera leucophaea.
introduction there is limited evidence regarding intra-observer and inter-observer variations in echocardiographic measurements of diastolic function. this study aimed to assess this reproducibly within a population-based cohort study. methods sixty subjects in sinus rhythm were randomly selected among 4th visit participants of the stanislas cohort (lorraine region, france). this 4th examination systematically included m-mode, 2-dimensional, dti and pulsed-wave doppler echocardiograms. reproducibility of variables was studied by intra-class correlation coefficients (icc) and bland altman plots. results our population was on average middle-aged (50 ± 14y), overweight (bmi = 26 ± 6kg/m2) and non-smoking (87%) with a quarter of the participants having self-declared hypertension or treated with anti-hypertensive medication(s). intra-observer icc were > 0.90 for all analyzed parameters except for left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) which was 0.89 (0.81–0.93). the mean relative intra-observer differences were small and limits of agreement of relative differences were narrow for all considered parameters (<5% and <15% respectively). inter-observer icc were > 0.90 for all analyzed parameters except for lvef (icc = 0.87) and both mitral and pulmonary a wave duration (0.83 and 0.73 respectively). the mean relative inter-observer differences were <5% for all parameters except for pulmonary a wave duration (mean difference = 6.5%). limits of agreement of relative differences were narrow (<15%), except for mitral a wave duration and velocity (both <20%) as well as left ventricular mass and pulmonary a wave duration (both <30%). intra-observer agreements with regard to the presence and severity of diastolic dysfunction were excellent (kappa = 0.93 (0.83–1.00) and 0.88 (0.75–0.99), respectively). conclusion in this validation study within the stanislas cohort, diastolic function echocardiographic parameters were found to be highly reproducible. diastolic dysfunction consequently appears as a highly effective clinical and research tool. quantification of cardiac chamber size, ventricular mass and function ranks among the most clinically important and most frequently requested tasks of echocardiography. over the last decades, echocardiographic methods and techniques have improved and expanded dramatically, due to the introduction of higher frequency transducers, harmonic imaging, fully digital machines, left-sided contrast agents, and other technological advancements. furthermore, echocardiography due to its portability and versatility is now used in emergency rooms, operating rooms, and intensive care units. standardization of measurements in echocardiography has been inconsistent and less successful, compared to other imaging techniques and consequently, echocardiographic measurements are sometimes perceived as less reliable. therefore, the american society of echocardiography, working together with the european association of echocardiography, a branch of the european society of cardiology, has critically reviewed the literature and updated the recommendations for quantifying cardiac chambers using echocardiography. this document reviews the technical aspects on how to perform quantitative chamber measurements of morphology and function, which is a component of every complete echocardiographic examination.
the ability of rhd patients to use context under conditions of increased processing demands was examined. subjects monitored for words in auditorily presented sentences of three context types-normal, semantically anomalous, and random, at three rates of speech normal, 70% compressed (experiment 1) and 60% compressed (experiment 2). effects of semantics and syntax were found for the rhd and normal groups under the normal rate of speech condition. using compressed rates of speech, the effect of syntax disappeared, but the effect of semantics remained. importantly, and contrary to expectations, the rhd group was similar to normals in continuing to demonstrate an effect of semantic context under conditions of increased processing demands. results are discussed relative to contemporary theories of laterality, based on studies with normals, that suggest that the involvement of the left versus right hemisphere in context use may depend upon the type of contextual information being processed. the ability of right-brain-damaged (rbd) patients to use on-line contextual information in a word-monitoring task was examined. subjects were required to monitor for target words in the contexts of both normal and semantically anomalous sentences. similar to previous studies with normals (e.g., marslen-wilson & tyler, 1980), the semantic integrity of the context was influential in the word-recognition process. importantly, the rbd patients performed similarly to normals in showing context effects. these results were interpreted as substantiating the findings of leonard, waters, and caplan (1997a, 1997b) that rbd patients do not present with a specific deficit in the use of contextual information. the results are discussed in terms of proposals that suggest that an impaired ability to use contextual information by rbd patients may be a function of increased processing demands.
research has demonstrated that information workers often manage several different computing devices in an effort to balance convenience, mobility, input efficiency, and content readability throughout their day. the high portability of the mobile phone has made it an increasingly valuable member of this ecosystem of devices. to understand how future technologies might better support productivity tasks as people transition between devices, we examined the mobile phone and pc usage patterns of sixteen information workers across several weeks. our data logs, together with follow-up interview feedback from four of the participants, confirm that the phone is highly leveraged for digital information needs beyond calls and sms, but suggest that these users do not currently traverse the device boundary within a given task. the number of computing devices that people use is growing. to gain a better understanding of why and how people use multiple devices, we interviewed 27 people from academia and industry. from these interviews we distill four primary findings. first, associating a user's activities with a particular device is problematic for multiple device users because many activities span multiple devices. second, device use varies by user and circumstance; users assign different roles to devices both by choice and by constraint. third, users in industry want to separate work and personal activities across work and personal devices, but they have difficulty doing so in practice finally, users employ a variety of techniques for accessing information across devices, but there is room for improvement: participants reported managing information across their devices as the most challenging aspect of using multiple devices. we suggest opportunities to improve the user experience by focusing on the user rather than the applications and devices; making devices aware of their roles; and providing lighter-weight methods for transferring information, including synchronization services that engender more trust from users.
the restricted area of space used by most mobile animals is thought to result from fitness-rewarding decisions derived from gaining information about the environment. yet, assessments of how animals deal with uncertainty using memory have been largely theoretical, and an empirically derived mechanism explaining restricted space use in animals is still lacking. using a patch-to-patch movement analysis, we investigated predictions of how free-ranging bison (bison bison) living in a meadow-forest matrix use memory to reduce uncertainty in energy intake rate. results indicate that bison remembered pertinent information about location and quality of meadows, and they used this information to selectively move to meadows of higher profitability. moreover, bison chose profitable meadows they had previously visited, and this choice was stronger after visiting a relatively poor quality meadow. our work demonstrates a link between memory, energy gains and restricted space use while establishing a fitness-based integration of movement, cognitive and spatial ecology. thanks to recent technological advances, it is now possible to track with an unprecedented precision and for long periods of time the movement patterns of many living organisms in their habitat. the increasing amount of data available on single trajectories offers the possibility of understanding how animals move and of testing basic movement models. random walks have long represented the main description for micro-organisms and have also been useful to understand the foraging behaviour of large animals. nevertheless, most vertebrates, in particular humans and other primates, rely on sophisticated cognitive tools such as spatial maps, episodic memory and travel cost discounting. these properties call for other modelling approaches of mobility patterns. we propose a foraging framework where a learning mobile agent uses a combination of memory-based and random steps. we investigate how advantageous it is to use memory for exploiting resources in heterogeneous and changing environments. an adequate balance of determinism and random exploration is found to maximize the foraging efficiency and to generate trajectories with an intricate spatio-temporal order, where travel routes emerge without multi-step planning. based on this approach, we propose some tools for analysing the non-random nature of mobility patterns in general.
we aimed at investigating mortality among beryllium‐exposed workers, according to solubility of beryllium and beryllium compounds. we conducted an historical cohort study of 16,115 workers employed during 1925–2008 in 15 facilities, including eight entailing exposure to insoluble beryllium and seven entailing exposure to soluble/mixed beryllium compounds, who were followed up for mortality until 2011. data were analyzed using indirect standardization and cox regression modeling. lung cancer standardized mortality ratio (smr, national reference rates) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.94–1.10) in the whole cohort, 0.88 (95% ci: 0.75–1.03) in the insoluble beryllium subcohort, and 1.09 (95% ci: 0.99–1.09) in the soluble/mixed beryllium subcohort. for lung cancer, there was an association with period of hire in soluble/mixed beryllium plants but not in insoluble plants, and, conversely, employment in soluble/mixed plants was associated with increased mortality only among workers hired before 1955. there was no trend with duration of employment. mortality from chronic beryllium disease increased, in particular, among workers hired before 1955 in soluble/mixed beryllium facilities. there was no increase in lung cancer mortality in the entire cohort and lung cancer mortality was not increased among beryllium workers hired in 1955 or later in soluble/mixed beryllium facilities, or at any time among those employed in insoluble beryllium facilities. there is controversy on whether occupational exposure to beryllium causes lung cancer. we conducted a systematic review of epidemiologic studies on cancer among workers exposed to beryllium, including a study of seven u.s. production plants which has been recently updated, a study of patients with beryllium disease (largely overlapping with the former study) and several smaller studies. a small excess mortality from lung cancer was detected in the large cohort, which was partially explained by confounding by tobacco smoking and urban residence. other potential confounders have not been addressed. the excess mortality was mainly among workers employed (often for a short duration) in the early phase of the manufacturing industry. there was no relation with duration of employment or cumulative exposure, whereas average and maximum exposure were associated with lung cancer risk. the use of lagged exposure variables resulted in associations with lung cancer risk; however, these associations were due to confounding by year of birth and year of hire. the studies of beryllium disease patients do not provide independent evidence and the results from other studies do not support the hypothesis of an increased risk of lung cancer or any other cancer. overall, the available evidence does not support a conclusion that a causal association has been established between occupational exposure to beryllium and the risk of cancer.
background renal artery stenosis (ras) is a common finding in patients undergoing coronary angiography. we designed this study to look for the frequency and any predictors of renal artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease (cad).   methods a total of 201 consecutive patients with cad confirmed by coronary angiography underwent an abdominal aortogram in the same sitting to screen for ras. patient demographics and co-morbidities were analysed for any association with ras.   results forty-one of the patients were female (20.4%); ninety patients were hypertensive (44.8%); 49 patients (24.4%) were smokers; 19 patients (9.5%) had renal insufficiency; 88 patients (43.8%) had high cholesterol levels; 44 patients (21.9%) were diabetic. thirty-two patients (15.9%) had single coronary artery disease, 59 patients (29.4%) had two vessel disease, and 110 patients (54.7%) had three vessel disease. significant renal artery stenosis (> or = 50% stenosis) was present in 26 patients (12.9%). among the variables studied, only female gender was found to be associated with a higher frequency of renal artery stenosis (24.39% vs 10.0%, p = 0.01).   conclusions the frequency of renal artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease is 12.9%. female gender is associated with a higher frequency of renal artery stenosis in patients with cad. in recent years, the importance of renovascular disease as a cause of end-stage renal disease has been emphasized. among 1,788 cases autopsied during the 12-year period between 1981 and 1992 at the national cardiovascular center hospital, we examined cases over 40 years of age with autopsy evidence of myocardial infarction to determine the prevalence and predictors of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in the atherosclerotic population. two hundred ninety-seven patients remained for analysis. in this population, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis was found in 35 patients (12%), and 10 of them had bilateral renal artery stenosis. in patients with hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis was found in 19%, 39%, and 39%, respectively. as the number of coronary vessels with significant stenosis increased, the prevalence of renal artery stenosis increased. the severity of stenotic lesions of coronary artery was also correlated with the presence of renal artery stenosis. multiple logistic regression analysis identified age, hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency as independent predictors of renal artery stenosis. patients with hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency had 3.4-, 13.5-, and 4.8-fold increased risk of renal artery stenosis in the population with myocardial infarction. the number of coronary arteries with severe stenosis was also an independent predictor of renal artery stenosis, and had a relative risk of 2.1. these results indicated that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is common in patients with myocardial infarction, particularly when hypertension, proteinuria, or renal insufficiency is present. the presence of severe multivessel coronary artery disease suggests a higher incidence of renal artery stenosis.
liver disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the spectrum of the disease ranged from fatty liver to hepatic inflammation, necrosis, progressive fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. we evaluated the serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1, total b-hexosaminidase and its isoenzymes hex a and b activities, and nitric oxide in patients with liver diseases and their association with aminotransferase level. seventy patients and 12 healthy subjects were recruited. patients were divided into three groups: chronic hepatitis group (20 patients), liver cirrhosis group (30 patients), and malignant liver group (20 patients). serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1, total b-hexosaminidase and its isoenzymes hex a and b activities, and nitric oxide were measured. serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1, total b-hexosaminidase activity, and nitric oxide were significantly higher in the liver disease patients. serum levels of isoenzymes hex a and b were significantly higher in malignant liver patients. total b-hexosaminidase and its isoenzyme hex a activity levels were significantly higher in positive hbsag and positive anti-hcv patients. serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 were positively correlated with aminotransferase level. taken together, these findings suggested that these biochemical indices might reflect ongoing disease activity and played an important role in the pathophysiology of liver diseases. liver cirrhosis is a risk factor for osteoporosis. nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms of bone mass loss in patients with viral cirrhosis. tnfalpha is a potent bone-resorbing agent. serum concentrations of soluble tnf receptor p55 (stnfr-55) correlate with clinical activity in liver cirrhosis. our aim was to evaluate the possible role of stnfr-55 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in patients with viral cirrhosis and its relationship with bone turnover markers. we studied 40 consecutive patients with viral cirrhosis and no history of alcohol intake and 26 healthy volunteers. bone mineral density (bmd) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine (ls) and femoral neck (fn). patients with viral cirrhosis had reduced bmd (expressed as the z-score) in all sites [ls, -1.5 +/- 0.22 (p < 0.001); fn, -0.37 +/- 0.15 (p < 0.01)]. serum concentrations of stnfr-55 and urinary deoxypyridinoline, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, were significantly higher in patients with osteoporosis than in patients without osteoporosis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). serum levels of stnfr-55 correlated inversely with bmd in ls (r = -0.62; p < 0.005) and fn (r = -0.47; p < 0.05) and positively with urinary deoxypyridinoline (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). our findings show that high serum concentrations of stnfr-55 play a role in the pathogenesis of viral cirrhosis-associated bone mass loss and provide evidence of increased bone resorption related to the high serum stnfr-55 levels.
retinal image displacements caused by saccadic eye movements are generally unnoticed. recent theories have proposed that perceptual stability across saccades depends on a local evaluation process centered on the saccade target object rather than on remapping and evaluating the positions of all objects in a display. in three experiments, we examined whether objects other than the saccade target also influence perceptual stability by measuring displacement detection thresholds across saccades for saccade targets and a variable number of non-saccade objects. we found that the positions of multiple objects are maintained across saccades, but with variable precision, with the saccade target object having priority in the perception of displacement, most likely because it is the focus of attention before the saccade and resides near the fovea after the saccade. the perception of displacement of objects that are not the saccade target is affected by acuity limitations, attentional limitations, and limitations on memory capacity. unlike previous studies that have found that a postsaccadic blank improves the detection of displacement direction across saccades, we found that postsaccadic blanking hurt the detection of displacement per se by increasing false alarms. overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that visual working memory underlies the perception of stability across saccades. recent evidence has suggested that relatively precise information about the location and visual form of a saccade target object is retained across a saccade. however, this information appears to be available for report only when the target is removed briefly, so that the display is blank when the eyes land. we hypothesized that the availability of precise target information is dependent on whether a post-saccade object is mapped to the same object representation established for the presaccade target. if so, then the post-saccade features of the target overwrite the presaccade features, a process of object mediated updating in which visual masking is governed by object continuity. in two experiments, participants' sensitivity to the spatial displacement of a saccade target was improved when that object changed surface feature properties across the saccade, consistent with the prediction of the object-mediating updating account. transsaccadic perception appears to depend on a mechanism of object-based masking that is observed across multiple domains of vision. in addition, the results demonstrate that surface-feature continuity contributes to visual stability across saccades.
background the burden of non-communicable disease (ncds) has grown rapidly in low- and middle-income countries (lmics), where populations are ageing, with rising prevalence of multimorbidity (more than two co-existing chronic conditions) that will significantly increase pressure on already stretched health systems. we assess the impact of ncd multimorbidity on healthcare utilisation and out-of-pocket expenditures in six middle-income countries: china, ghana, india, mexico, russia and south africa. methods secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from adult participants (>18 years) in the who study on global ageing and adult health (sage) 2007–2010. we used multiple logistic regression to determine socio-demographic correlates of multimorbidity. association between the number of ncds and healthcare utilisation as well as out-of-pocket spending was assessed using logistic, negative binominal and log-linear models. results the prevalence of multimorbidity in the adult population varied from 3∙9% in ghana to 33∙6% in russia. number of visits to doctors in primary and secondary care rose substantially for persons with increasing numbers of co-existing ncds. multimorbidity was associated with more outpatient visits in china (coefficient for number of ncd = 0∙56, 95% ci = 0∙46, 0∙66), a higher likelihood of being hospitalised in india (aor = 1∙59, 95% ci = 1∙45, 1∙75), higher out-of-pocket expenditures for outpatient visits in india and china, and higher expenditures for hospital visits in russia. medicines constituted the largest proportion of out-of-pocket expenditures in persons with multimorbidity (88∙3% for outpatient, 55∙9% for inpatient visit in china) in most countries. conclusion multimorbidity is associated with higher levels of healthcare utilisation and greater financial burden for individuals in middle-income countries. our study supports the who call for universal health insurance and health service coverage in lmics, particularly for vulnerable groups such as the elderly with multimorbidity. background long-term disorders are the main challenge facing health-care systems worldwide, but health systems are largely configured for individual diseases rather than multimorbidity. we examined the distribution of multimorbidity, and of comorbidity of physical and mental health disorders, in relation to age and socioeconomic deprivation.   methods in a cross-sectional study we extracted data on 40 morbidities from a database of 1,751,841 people registered with 314 medical practices in scotland as of march, 2007. we analysed the data according to the number of morbidities, disorder type (physical or mental), sex, age, and socioeconomic status. we defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more disorders.   findings 42·2% (95% ci 42·1-42·3) of all patients had one or more morbidities, and 23·2% (23·08-23·21) were multimorbid. although the prevalence of multimorbidity increased substantially with age and was present in most people aged 65 years and older, the absolute number of people with multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years (210,500 vs 194,996). onset of multimorbidity occurred 10-15 years earlier in people living in the most deprived areas compared with the most affluent, with socioeconomic deprivation particularly associated with multimorbidity that included mental health disorders (prevalence of both physical and mental health disorder 11·0%, 95% ci 10·9-11·2% in most deprived area vs 5·9%, 5·8%-6·0% in least deprived). the presence of a mental health disorder increased as the number of physical morbidities increased (adjusted odds ratio 6·74, 95% ci 6·59-6·90 for five or more disorders vs 1·95, 1·93-1·98 for one disorder), and was much greater in more deprived than in less deprived people (2·28, 2·21-2·32 vs 1·08, 1·05-1·11).   interpretation our findings challenge the single-disease framework by which most health care, medical research, and medical education is configured. a complementary strategy is needed, supporting generalist clinicians to provide personalised, comprehensive continuity of care, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas.   funding scottish government chief scientist office.
studies of explicit processing of facial expressions by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) have found a variety of deficits and preserved abilities compared to their typically developing (td) peers. however, little attention has been paid to their implicit processing abilities for emotional facial expressions. the question has also been raised whether preferential attention to the mouth region of a speaker's face by asd individuals has resulted in a relative lipreading expertise. we present data on implicit processing of pseudo-dynamic facial emotions and visual speech in adolescents with autism. we compared 25 asd and 25 td participants on their ability to recreate the sequences of four dynamic emotional facial expressions (happy, sad, disgust, fear) as well as four spoken words (with, bath, thumb, watch) using six still images taken from a video sequence. typical adolescents were significantly better at recreating the dynamic properties of emotional expressions than those of facial speech, while the autism group showed the reverse accuracy pattern. for experiment 2 we obscured the eye region of the stimuli and found no significant difference between the 22 adolescents with asd and 22 td controls. fearful faces achieved the highest accuracy results among the emotions in both groups. this study examined differences in the ability to decode emotion through facial expression, prosody, and verbal content between 14 children with asperger’s syndrome (as) and 16 typically developing peers. the ability to decode emotion was measured by the perception of emotion test (poet), which portrayed the emotions of happy, angry, sad, and neutral among the modalities of static and dynamic facial expression, prosody, verbal content, and all modalities combined. results revealed that children with as had more difficulty identifying emotions through static facial expression, dynamic facial expression, and prosody than typically developing children. results are discussed in relationship to an over-reliance on verbal content as a compensatory strategy in social interactions. treatment implications for individuals with as are also discussed.
we investigated the association between dietary intake of folate, vitamin b6, and the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) genotype with breast cancer. a matched case-control study was conducted, and 413 patients with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed breast cancer and 436 controls were recruited. folate intake, vitamin b6, and vitamin b12 levels were calculated, and the mthfr c677t and a1298c and mtr a2756g polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. breast cancer cases were generally older, older at first live birth, and younger at menarche, had a higher body mass index, were smokers, had higher energy intake, and more first-degree relatives with breast cancer as well as more live births compared to controls. with respect to energy intake, we found that higher energy intake were more likely to increase the risk of breast cancer. the mthfr 667tt genotype was associated with a moderately increased risk of breast cancer when compared with the cc genotype, and a significant odds ratio (or; 95% confidence interval, ci) was found (or = 1.70, 95%ci = 1.06-2.73). individuals carrying t allele were associated with higher risk of breast cancer when compared with c allele (or = 1.34, 95%ci = 1.06-1.70). we did not find a significant effect of the mthfr a1298c and mtr a2756g on the risk of breast cancer. we did not find any association between folate intake and mthfr c677t polymorphisms. in conclusion, we found that the mthfr c667t polymorphism is associated with the risk of breast cancer, indicating that this genotype plays a role in breast cancer development. objective to evaluate the relationship between dietary folate intake and genetic polymorphisms of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) with reference to breast cancer risk.   methods a case-control study was conducted with 669 cases and 682 population-based controls in jiangsu province of china. mthfr c677t and a1298c genotypes were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) methods. dietary folate intake was assessed by using an 83-item food frequency questionnaire. odds ratios (or) were estimated with an unconditional logistic model.   results the frequencies of mthfr c677t c/c, c/t and t/t genotypes were 32.37% (202/624), 48.88% (305/624) and 18.75% (117/624) in cases and 37.66% (235/624), 48.24% (301/624) and 14. 10% (88/624) in controls, respectively. the difference in distribution was significant (chi2 = 6.616, p = 0.037), the t/t genotype being associated with an elevated or for breast cancer (1.62, 95% ci: 1.14 -2.30). the frequencies of mthfr a1298c a/a, a/c and c/c were 71.47% (446/624), 27.08% (169/624) and 1.44% (9/624) in cases and 68.11%(425/624), 30.13% (188/624) and 1.76% (11/624)in controls,with no significant differences found (chi2 = 1.716, p= 0.424). folate intake of cases [(263.00 +/- 137.38) microg/d] was significantly lower than that of controls [(285.12 +/- 149.61) microg/d] (t = -2. 830, p =0.005). compared with the lowest tertile (< or = 199.08 microg/d) of folate intake, the adjusted or for breast cancer in the top tertile (> or = 315.11 microg/d) was 0.70 (95% ci: 0.53 -0.92). among individuals with the mthfr a1298c a/a genotype,adjusted or for breast cancer were 0.89 (95% ci: 0.62 - 1.27) and 1.69 (95% ci: 1.20 - 2.36) for the second to the third tertile of folate intake compared with the highest folate intake group (x2trend = 11.372, p = 0.001).   conclusion the findings of the present study suggest that mthfr genetic polymorphisms,and dietary intake of folate may modify susceptibility to breast cancer.
backgroundcarboxylation is a modification of glutamate (glu) residues which occurs post-translation that is catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. vitamin k is a critical co-factor in the post-translational conversion of glu residues to γ-carboxyglutamate (gla) residues. it has been shown that the process of carboxylation is involved in the blood clotting cascade, bone growth, and extraosseous calcification. however, studies in this field have been limited by the difficulty of experimentally studying substrate site specificity in γ-glutamyl carboxylation. in silico investigations have the potential for characterizing carboxylated sites before experiments are carried out.resultsbecause of the importance of γ-glutamyl carboxylation in biological mechanisms, this study investigates the substrate site specificity in carboxylation sites. it considers not only the composition of amino acids that surround carboxylation sites, but also the structural characteristics of these sites, including secondary structure and solvent-accessible surface area (asa). the explored features are used to establish a predictive model for differentiating between carboxylation sites and non-carboxylation sites. a support vector machine (svm) is employed to establish a predictive model with various features. a five-fold cross-validation evaluation reveals that the svm model, trained with the combined features of positional weighted matrix (pwm), amino acid composition (aac), and asa, yields the highest accuracy (0.892). furthermore, an independent testing set is constructed to evaluate whether the predictive model is over-fitted to the training set.conclusionsindependent testing data that did not undergo the cross-validation process shows that the proposed model can differentiate between carboxylation sites and non-carboxylation sites. this investigation is the first to study carboxylation sites and to develop a system for identifying them. the proposed method is a practical means of preliminary analysis and greatly diminishes the total number of potential carboxylation sites requiring further experimental confirmation. summary rvp-net is an online program for the prediction of real valued solvent accessibility. all previous methods of accessible surface area (asa) predictions classify amino acid residues into exposure states and named them buried or exposed based on different thresholds. real values in some cases were generated by taking the mid points of these state thresholds. this is the first method, which provides a direct prediction of asa without making exposure categories and achieves results better than 19% mean absolute error. to facilitate batch processing of several sequences, a standalone version of this tool is also provided.   availability online predictions are available at http://www.netasa.org/rvp-net/. standalone version of the program can be obtained from the corresponding author by e-mail request.
you might find this additional info useful... 24 times a year (twice monthly) by the american physiological society, 9650 rockville pike, bethesda md systems with techniques linking genes and pathways to physiology, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. it is published publishes results of a wide variety of studies from human and from informative model physiological genomics background & aims gastrin deficiency and proton pump inhibitor treatment cause achlorhydria, which predisposes to disease. to elucidate the underlying molecular biology, we examined the changes in gastric gene expression in both types of achlorhydria. we also explored the associated changes in the gastric microflora and the long-term consequences of gastrin-deficient achlorhydria.   methods expression profiles were generated from gastric rna from wild-type mice, gastrin knockout (ko) mice, gastrin ko mice after 1 week of gastrin infusion, and wild-type mice treated for 1 month with a proton pump inhibitor. the results were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. selective media were used to characterize the gastric microflora.   results the number of gastric bacteria was increased in both gastrin ko and ppi-treated mice. the expression profiles revealed activation of immune defense genes, interferon-regulated response genes, and intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa. in young gastrin-deficient mice, gastrin infusions reversed the changes. over time, the changes accumulated, became irreversible, and progressed into metaplasia and polyp development. finally, the study showed that gastrin regulated the expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins.   conclusions independently of gastrin, achlorhydria is associated with gastric bacterial overgrowth and intestinal gene expression patterns and is associated with predisposition to disease. gastrin is therefore essential for prevention of gastric disease, mainly through control of acid secretion but to a lesser extent also through control of gastric gene expression. the gastrin-deficient mouse serves as a useful new model for gastric metaplasia and neoplasia.
skeletal muscle contractility and myosin function decline following ovariectomy in mature female mice. in the present study we tested the hypothesis that estradiol replacement can reverse those declines. four-month-old female c57bl/6 mice (n = 69) were ovariectomized (ovx) or sham operated. some mice were treated immediately with placebo or 17beta-estradiol (ovx + e(2)) while other mice were treated 30 days postsurgery. thirty or sixty days postsurgery, soleus muscles were assessed in vitro for contractile function and susceptibility to eccentric contraction-induced injury. myosin structural dynamics was analyzed in extensor digitorum longus (edl) muscles by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. maximal isometric tetanic force was affected by estradiol status (p < 0.001) being approximately 10% less in soleus muscles from ovx compared with sham-operated mice [168 mn (sd 16.7) vs. 180 mn (sd 14.4)] and was restored in ovx + e(2) mice [187 mn (sd 17.6)]. the fraction of strong-binding myosin during contraction was also affected (p = 0.045) and was approximately 15% lower in edl muscles from ovx compared with ovx + e(2) mice [0.263 (sd 0.034) vs. 0.311 (sd 0.022)]. plasma estradiol levels were correlated with maximal isometric tetanic force (r = 0.458; p < 0.001) and active stiffness (r = 0.329; p = 0.044), indicating that circulating estradiol influenced muscle and myosin function. estradiol was not effective in protecting muscle against an acute eccentric contraction-induced injury (p >or= 0.401) but did restore ovariectomy-induced increases in muscle wet mass caused by fluid accumulation. collectively, estradiol had a beneficial effect on female mouse skeletal muscle. the study's objective was to determine whether estradiol (e2) deficiency alters the functional relationship of muscle to bone and causes a differential increase in injury susceptibility. ovariectomized 6-wk-old mice were administered e2 (40 micrograms. day-1. kg-1; n = 8) or the oil vehicle (n = 8) for 21 days. the anterior crural muscles of the left hindlimb were then stimulated to produce 150 maximal in vivo eccentric contractions. in vitro functional measurements were then made on the extensor digitorum longus (edl) muscle and tibia from both the exercised and unexercised legs. the maximal isometric torque produced by the anterior crural muscles before the eccentric contraction protocol and the unexercised edl maximal isometric tetanic force (p(0)) were higher in e2-treated mice by 18 and 14%, respectively (p < or = 0.03). both ultimate load and stiffness for the unexercised tibia were higher by 16% in e2-treated mice (p < or = 0.03). the muscle-to-bone relationship of these measurements was unaffected by e2 status (p > or = 0.59). no evidence for increased injury susceptibility was found in either tissue from e2-deficient mice. in fact, the decrement in p(0) was only 36.9 +/- 3.8% in exercised edl muscles from e2-deficient mice compared with 50.6 +/- 4.2% in exercised muscles from e2-treated mice (p = 0.03). tibia stiffness was 3.9% higher in bones from exercised legs than in bones from unexercised legs (72.64 +/- 2.77 vs. 69.95 +/- 2.66 n/mm; p = 0.05) with ultimate load showing a similar trend (p = 0.07); no effect of e2 status was observed on these differences (p > or = 0.53). in conclusion, the functional relationship of bone to muscle and the susceptibility to injury in bone are not altered by the presence of e2 in ovariectomized mice; however, e2 does increase injury susceptibility in the edl muscle.
prostate cancer (pc) is a major health problem in adult males. trpm8, a cationic trp channel activated by cooling and menthol is upregulated in pc. however, the precise role of trpm8 in pc is still unclear. some studies hypothesized that trpm8-mediated transmembrane ca2+ fluxes play a key role in cellular proliferation of pc cells. in contrast, other findings suggest that high trpm8 levels may reduce the metastatic potential of pc cells. a detailed understanding of the response of trpm8 channels to pharmacological modulators of their activity is relevant when considering potential therapies, targeting this ion channel to treat pc. we characterized the pharmacological and functional properties of native trpm8 channels in four human prostate cell lines, pnt1a, lncap, du145, and pc3, commonly used as experimental models of pc. pnt1a is a non-tumoral prostate cell line while the other three correspond to different stages of pc. here, we show that cold- and agonist-evoked [ca2+]i responses in pc cells are much less sensitive to well-characterized agonists (menthol and icilin) and antagonists (bctc, clotrimazole, and dd01050) of trpm8 channels, compared to trpm8 channels in other tissues, suggesting a different molecular composition and/or spatial organization. in addition, the forced overexpression of human trpm8 facilitated the trafficking of trpm8 channels residing in the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, leading to a marked potentiation in the efficacy of the different blockers. these results predict that blockers of canonical trpm8 channels may be less effective in halting proliferation of pc cells than expected. the ca2+-permeable channel trpm8 is thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer. we have investigated the intracellular location of trpm8 and its role as a ca2+-permeable channel in an androgen-responsive and an androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell line. we report evidence from immunofluorescence experiments that in the androgen-responsive lncap cell line, the trpm8 protein is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, acts as a ca2+-permeable channel (assessed using fura-2 to measure increases in the cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration) in each of these membranes, and is regulated by androgen. although trpm8 was detected in the androgen-insensitive pc-3 cell line, no evidence was obtained for regulation of its expression by androgen. the results of experiments using lncap cells, the trpm8 antagonist capsazepine, and small interference rna targeted to trpm8 indicate that trpm8 is required for cell survival. these results indicate that trpm8 is an important determinator of ca2+ homeostasis in prostate epithelial cells and may be a potential target for the action of drugs in the management of prostate cancer.
the hippocampus (dentate gyrus dg plus cornu ammonis, ca) is vulnerable to neuropathological events such as ischemia. the dg is a region where neurogenesis takes place and it has been demonstrated that ischemia stimulates neurogenesis. nitric oxide (no) plays a major role in ischemic damage evolution and increases in rat hippocampus after ischemia. no information is available on the presence of nnos-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the hippocampus of ischemic animals; whereas, the presence of the inos protein has been reported in the dg after focal ischemia. we evaluated, immunohistochemically, the cell types expressing nnos and inos in the rat hippocampus by 24 up to 144 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion to ascertain whether ischemia induces changes in nnos or inos expression and whether a relationship exists between these changes and the animal survival. nnos-ir interneurons were detected in control and ischemic rats; in the latter, their number was significantly decreased at all time points. inos-ir interneurons appeared in the hippocampus of ischemic rats at 24 h; their number was significantly higher in the animals with longer survival and did not change at later time points. more than 50% of the nnos-ir interneurons co-expressed inos-ir. all these changes were seen both in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus. in conclusion, the focal ischemia affects the hippocampus which responds bilaterally to the injury. we hypothesize that the decrease in the nnos-ir neurons is likely due to either a neuronal loss or a switching towards the inos production which, by inducing neurogenesis, might compensate the neuronal loss. we presently investigated the time-course of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and content in the rat striatum up to 6 days after ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, a condition that potentially allows functional recovery, with the aim to identify the cell types expressing these two enzymes and to correlate neuronal nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase changes in order to verify whether and how these changes are related to tissue damage, motor-sensory performances and survival. before and after surgery, the animals underwent neurological evaluation. the results demonstrated that the rats with a score > or = 12 at the neurological evaluation 24 h after ischemia showed a significant increase in neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones and absence of inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells and survived up to the sixth day; conversely, the rats with a score < 12 at the neurological evaluation 24 h after ischemia showed a progressive significant decrease in neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones and appearance of inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells and none of the rats survived up to the sixth day. microglia cells were activated in both groups but only in the latter did these cells express inducible nitric oxide synthase. measurement of the infarct area demonstrated that it occupied a similar territory in both groups of rats but in those with a score < 12 the edema was more extended. in conclusion, we demonstrated that a neurotoxic insult such as ischemia can induce neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression in the neurones and that when neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones increase in number, microglia activation is less extended, inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells are absent, tissue damage reduced and the rats survive longer. conversely, when there is a significant decrease of neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones, microglia cells are intensely activated, inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells appear and the animal survival is shortened.
influenza a viral infections have been identified as the etiologic agents for historic pandemics, and contribute to the annual mortality associated with acute viral pneumonia. while both innate and acquired immunity are important in combating influenza virus infection, the mechanism connecting these arms of the immune system remains unknown. recent data have indicated that the notch system is an important bridge between antigen-presenting cells (apcs) and t cell communication circuits and plays a central role in driving the immune system to overcome disease. in the present study, we examine the role of notch signaling during influenza h1n1 virus infection, focusing on apcs. we demonstrate here that macrophages, but not dendritic cells (dcs), increased notch ligand delta-like 1 (dll1) expression following influenza virus challenge. dll1 expression on macrophages was dependent on retinoic acid-inducible gene-i (rig-i) induced type-i ifn pathway, and not on the tlr3-trif pathway. we also found that ifnα-receptor knockout mice failed to induce dll1 expression on lung macrophages and had enhanced mortality during influenza virus infection. our results further showed that specific neutralization of dll1 during influenza virus challenge induced higher mortality, impaired viral clearance, and decreased levels of ifn-γ. in addition, we blocked notch signaling by using γ-secretase inhibitor (gsi), a notch signaling inhibitor. intranasal administration of gsi during influenza infection also led to higher mortality, and higher virus load with excessive inflammation and an impaired production of ifn-γ in lungs. moreover, dll1 expression on macrophages specifically regulates ifn-γ levels from cd4+and cd8+t cells, which are important for anti-viral immunity. together, the results of this study show that dll1 positively influences the development of anti-viral immunity, and may provide mechanistic approaches for modifying and controlling the immune response against influenza h1n1 virus infection. viral infection often activates the interferon (ifn)-γ–inducible gene, nitric oxide synthase 2 (nos2). expression of nos2 can limit viral growth but may also suppress the immune system and damage tissue. this study assessed each of these effects in genetically deficient nos2−/− mice after infection with influenza a, a virus against which ifn-γ has no known activity. at inocula sufficient to cause consolidating pneumonitis and death in wild-type control mice, nos2−/− hosts survived with little histopathologic evidence of pneumonitis. moreover, they cleared influenza a virus from their lungs by an ifn-γ–dependent mechanism that was not evident in wild-type mice. even when the ifn-γ–mediated antiviral activity was blocked in nos2−/− mice with anti–ifn-γ mab, such mice failed to succumb to disease. further evidence that this protection was independent of viral load was provided by treating nos2+/+ mice with the nos inhibitor, n ω-methyl-l-arginine (l-nma). l-nma prevented mortality without affecting viral growth. thus, host nos2 seems to contribute more significantly to the development of influenza pneumonitis in mice than the cytopathic effects of viral replication. although nos2 mediates some antiviral effects of ifn-γ, during influenza infection it can suppress another ifn-γ–dependent antiviral mechanism. this mechanism was observed only in the complete absence of nos2 activity and appeared sufficient to control influenza a virus growth in the absence of changes in cytotoxic t lymphocyte activity.
backgroundseveral genome-wide association studies revealed that several variants of umod gene were related to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr), ckd or hypertension. in this study, we investigated the association between a common variant rs13333226 in the promoter region of umod gene and end stage renal disease (esrd).methodsvariant rs13333226 of umod gene was genotyped by using the abi real time taqman allelic discrimination assay in a case-control study including 638 unrelated patients with esrd and 366 controls.resultsthe frequency of umod snp rs13333226 gg/ga genotype was significantly higher (36.83% vs. 20.22%, p = 4.02 × 10-8) and the frequency of g allele was much higher (19.04% vs. 11.20%, p = 4.00 × 10−6) in the patients with esrd than in the controls. the g allele was associated with an increased risk of esrd (odds ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.70–3.11, p = 6.10 × 10−8). and g allele (odds ratio 2.33, 95% confidence interval 1.32–4.13, p = 3.65 × 10−3) was associated independently with esrd.conclusionsa common variation rs13333226 in the promoter region of umod gene was independently associated with esrd in han chinese. chronic kidney disease (ckd) has a heritable component and is an important global public health problem because of its high prevalence and morbidity. we conducted genome-wide association studies (gwas) to identify susceptibility loci for glomerular filtration rate, estimated by serum creatinine (egfrcrea) and cystatin c (egfrcys), and ckd (egfrcrea < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) in european-ancestry participants of four population-based cohorts (aric, chs, fhs, rs; n = 19,877; 2,388 ckd cases), and tested for replication in 21,466 participants (1,932 ckd cases). we identified significant snp associations (p < 5 × 10−8) with ckd at the umod locus, with egfrcrea at umod, shroom3 and gatm-spata5l1, and with egfrcys at cst and stc1. umod encodes the most common protein in human urine, tamm-horsfall protein, and rare mutations in umod cause mendelian forms of kidney disease. our findings provide new insights into ckd pathogenesis and underscore the importance of common genetic variants influencing renal function and disease.
background oligodendroglial neoplasms have morphologic and genotypic heterogeneity. loss of heterozygosity (loh) of 1p and/or 19q is associated with increased treatment responsiveness and overall survival. however, the pathogenesis of treatment-resistance is unknown. we sought to determine if tumour progression is due to a proliferating sub-population of tumour cells with intact 1p, or if recurrent tumours retain 1p/19q loh. methods 24 patients with oligodendroglial neoplasms, possessing biopsy samples taken at diagnosis and at progression, were identified. 53 tumour specimens were available for loh analysis of 1p and 19q, using pcr amplification of multiple microsatellite markers. 40 were also tested for 9p and 10q. results at diagnosis, the median age was 34 (24–66) years, 14 were male. 19 tumours were who grade ii, and 5 were high grade. the most common genomic status was 19q loh (70%). 13 (54%) tumours were 1p loh at diagnosis: of these, 12 were 19q loh, and 1 was 19q uninformative. all 12 patients with 1p/19q loh primary tumours had persistent co-deletion at progression. 9 (38%) tumours were 1p intact at diagnosis, and 8 remained 1p intact in the progressed tumours. there was little heterogeneity of 9p and 10q between tumours at diagnosis and progression. conclusion 100% of oligodendroglial tumours with 1p/19q loh, demonstrated persistent 1p/19q loh in the progressed tumour. therefore, progression of these tumours is not due to a proliferating sub-population of treatment-resistant, 1p intact tumour cells. we propose that additional mutations contribute to this aggressive phenotype, however, 9p loh or 10q loh are unlikely to be involved. although 1p/19q codeletions define “genetically favorable” oligodendrogliomas, eventual tumor progression and patient death remain constant. genetic testing is often performed at the time of recurrence, though it is unclear whether these or other genetic alterations provide useful prognostic information. we characterized 138 of 189 (73%) available primary and recurrent oligodendroglial neoplasms from 80 patients, utilizing paired fish probes for 1p32/1q42, 19p13/19q13, cep7/ egfr, cep9/p16, and pten/dmbt1. patients were followed until death (49%), or a median follow-up of 8.9 years. patients with 1p/19q codeleted tumors (71%) had an estimated overall median survival of 14.9 years with an estimated 3.9 years from first recurrence. in contrast, those lacking deletions had significantly lower estimated overall median survivals of 4.7 years and 1.0 year after first recurrence (both p < 0.001). this increased survival in patients with 1p/19q codeleted tumors remained significant when adjustments were made for age, tumor grade, type of surgical procedure, and treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. only 1 recurrence showed focal egfr amplification, while 5 developed 10q deletions, mostly in high-grade mixed oligoastrocytomas lacking 1p/19q deletions. in contrast, p16 (9p21) deletions were common and associated with both high grade (p < 0.001) and recurrence (p = 0.002). our data suggest that in classic oligodendrogliomas: 1) 1p/19q tumor status is a powerful predictor of patient survival, even after recurrence; 2) p16 deletions are common progression-associated alterations; and 3) 10q deletions and egfr amplifications are sufficiently rare to suggest the possibility of alternate diagnoses.
introductionthere is a trend towards surgical treatment of acute ruptured achilles tendon. while classical open surgical procedures have been shown to restore good functional capacity, they are potentially associated with significant complications like wound infection and paresthesia. modern mini-invasive surgical techniques significantly reduce these complications and are also associated with good functional results so that they can be considered as the surgical treatment of choice. nevertheless, there is still a need for conservative alternative and recent studies report good results with conservative treatment in rigid casts or braces.patients/methodwe report the use of a dynamic ankle brace in the conservative treatment of achilles tendon rupture in a prospective non-randomised study of 57 consecutive patients. patients were evaluated at an average follow-up time of 5 years using the modified leppilahti ankle score, and the first 30 patients additionally underwent a clinical examination and muscular testing with a cybex isokinetic dynamometer at 6 and 12 months.resultswe found good and excellent results in most cases. we observed five complete re-ruptures, almost exclusively in case of poor patient’s compliance, two partial re-ruptures and one deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism.conclusionalthough prospective comparison with other modern treatment options is still required, the functional outcome after early ankle mobilisation in a dynamic cast is good enough to ethically propose this method as an alternative to surgical treatment. background there is a lack of consensus regarding the best option for the treatment of acute achilles tendon rupture. treatment can be broadly classified as operative (open or percutaneous) or nonoperative (casting or functional bracing). postoperative splinting can be performed with a rigid cast (proximal or distal to the knee) or a more mobile functional brace. the aim of this meta-analysis was to identify and summarize the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the effectiveness of different interventions for the treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures.   methods we searched multiple databases (including embase, cinahl, and medline) as well as reference lists of articles and contacted authors. keywords included achilles tendon, rupture, and tendon injuries. three reviewers extracted data and independently assessed trial quality with use of a ten-item scale.   results twelve trials involving 800 patients were included. there was a variable level of methodological rigor and reporting of outcomes. open operative treatment was associated with a lower risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.64). however, it was associated with a higher risk of other complications, including infection, adhesions, and disturbed skin sensibility (relative risk, 10.60; 95% confidence interval, 4.82 to 23.28). percutaneous repair was associated with a lower complication rate compared with open operative repair (relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.62). patients who had been managed with a functional brace postoperatively (allowing for early mobilization) had a lower complication rate compared with those who had been managed with a cast (relative risk, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 2.76). because of the small number of patients involved, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different nonoperative treatment regimens.   conclusions open operative treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment, but operative treatment is associated with a significantly higher risk of other complications. operative risks may be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously. postoperative splinting with use of a functional brace reduces the overall complication rate.   level of evidence therapeutic level i.
gonorrhoea continues to be a public health problem in the uk, and is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (sti) after chlamydia. in the uk, gonorrhoea is disproportionately concentrated in epidemiologically distinct subpopulations, with much higher incidence rates in young people, some ethnic minorities and inner city subpopulations. the original model of sti transmission proposed by hethcote and yorke explained some of these features through the concept of the ‘core group’. since then, several authors have modified the original model approach to include multiple sexual activity classes, but found this modelling approach to be inadequate when applied to low-prevalence settings such as the uk. we present a metapopulation framework for modelling gonorrhoea and other stis. the model proposes that the epidemiology of gonorrhoea is largely driven by subpopulations with higher than average concentrations of individuals with high sexual risk activity. we show how this conceptualization of gonococcal epidemiology overcomes key limitations associated with some of the prior efforts to model gonorrhoea. we also use the model to explain several epidemiological features of gonorrhoea, such as its asymmetric distribution across subpopulations, and the contextual risk experienced by members of at-risk subpopulations. finally, we extend the model to explain the distribution of other stis, using chlamydia as an example of a more ubiquitous bacterial sti. spatial distribution of repeat and singly occurring gonorrhea in baltimore, maryland, was examined to identify clusters of core transmitters. gonorrhea reported between 2001 and 2002 was geocoded and mapped. those with more than one gonorrhea infection separated by more than 14 days during the 2-year period were considered repeaters. other cases were treated as isolated events. six definitions of core transmission were examined by census tracts with the highest quintiles of 1) cases for 2001, 2) cases for 2002, 3) rates for 2001, 4) rates for 2002, 5) counts of repeaters over the 2-year period, and 6) proportion of total cases that were repeaters. of the 6,108 gonorrhea cases analyzed, 9% were repeaters. repeaters were more likely to be female and younger. core areas identified by definitions based on overall disease burden agreed well with each other but had poor agreement with definitions based upon repeat infections. repeaters clustered to a greater extent at smaller distances than did singly occurring gonorrhea cases. repeat gonorrhea infections are prevalent in baltimore and likely represent behavior consistent with core transmission. census tracts of core transmission defined by geographic distribution of repeat infections may indicate foci of highest risk sexual behaviors and high transmission.
objective to determine whether moderate alcohol intake modifies the association between low vitamin d levels and insulin resistance (ir), we hypothesized that moderate alcohol intake would have a modifying effect on ir in people with low vitamin d levels.   methods this was a cross-sectional analysis of subjects > or = 20 y old without a history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, or stroke in the national health and nutrition examination survey 2001-2004. main outcome was ir status measured by homeostasis model assessment for ir (homa-ir; > or = 2.6) and fasting insulin (>12.2 microu/ml) in moderate drinkers compared with non-drinkers by vitamin d levels (deficient < or = 20 ng/ml, insufficient 21-32 ng/ml, normal >32 ng/ml).   results two thousand seven hundred twenty-one subjects met the inclusion criteria, representing a weighted total of >138 million people. of these, 34% were vitamin d deficient and 47% insufficient. in adjusted analysis, compared with moderate drinkers with normal vitamin d levels, non-drinkers had no increased risk of ir by homa-ir levels (odds ratio [or] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.61-2.30). vitamin d-deficient individuals had a higher risk of ir regardless of alcohol consumption (moderate drinkers or 2.12, 95% ci 1.41-3.19; non-drinkers or 2.22, 95% ci 1.29-3.83). however, in those with insufficient vitamin d levels, moderate alcohol intake had a modifying effect on the odds of ir, with no difference seen in moderate drinkers (or 1.29, 95% ci 0.92-1.80) and an increased risk found in non-drinkers (or 1.82, 95% ci 1.07-3.11). similar results were seen with fasting insulin.   conclusion moderate alcohol consumption appears to have a modifying effect on the risk of ir in individuals with insufficient levels of vitamin d. the effects of a vitamin d deficiency on insulin and glucagon release was determined in the isolated perfused rat pancreas by radioimmunoassay of the secreted proteins. during a 30-minute period of perfusion with glucose and arginine, pancreases from vitamin d-deficient rats exhibited a 48 percent reduction in insulin secretion compared to that for pancreases from vitamin d-deficient rats that had been replenished with vitamin d. vitamin d status had no effect on pancreatic glucagon secretion. this result, along with the previously demonstrated presence in the pancreas of a vitamin d-dependent calcium-binding protein and cytosol receptor for the hormonal form of vitamin d, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3, indicates an important role for vitamin d in the endocrine functioning of the pancreas.
mitochondrial division, essential for survival in mammals, is enhanced by an inter-organellar process involving er tubules encircling and constricting mitochondria. the force for constriction is thought to involve actin polymerization by the er-anchored isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (inf2). unknown is the mechanism triggering inf2-mediated actin polymerization at er-mitochondria intersections. we show that a novel isoform of the formin-binding, actin-nucleating protein spire, spire1c, localizes to mitochondria and directly links mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton and the er. spire1c binds inf2 and promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces. disrupting either spire1c actin- or formin-binding activities reduces mitochondrial constriction and division. we propose spire1c cooperates with inf2 to regulate actin assembly at er-mitochondrial contacts. simulations support this model's feasibility and demonstrate polymerizing actin filaments can induce mitochondrial constriction. thus, spire1c is optimally positioned to serve as a molecular hub that links mitochondria to actin and the er for regulation of mitochondrial division. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.08828.001 masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
summaryobjective. gender differences in clinical presentation and response to sertraline treatment were examined for patients diagnosed with dsm-iii-r panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.  method. data was pooled from 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient studies (males, n = 335; females, n = 338). two were 12-week fixed-dose studies (sertraline 50 mg vs. 100 mg vs. 200 mg) and 2 were 10-week flexible-dose studies (sertraline 50–200 mg). primary outcome measures consisted of the clinical global impression-improvement scale (cgi-i) and change in panic attack frequency.  results. the clinical presentation of panic disorder was similar except that men reported an earlier age of onset, shorter duration of illness, and significantly more frequent history of alcohol and/or substance dependence/abuse. sertraline was significantly more effective than placebo in both women and men on the 2 primary outcome measures. when between-sex efficacy was compared, women achieved significantly greater improvement than men on panic frequency and cgi-i, but had equivalent improvement on all other measures. there was no significant between-sex difference in study completion rates, or in adverse event profiles.  conclusions. there was a modest but consistent trend for women to show superior efficacy at the end of acute sertraline treatment. this gender effect only occasionally achieved significance, and must be confirmed by future treatment research. unlabelled a gradual decline in estrogen levels after the age of 40 may contribute to a higher rate of depression in women over 45 years of age. estrogen replacement therapy (ert) has been shown to produce cognitive and mood-enhancing effects in women and may facilitate antidepressant activity.   methods we examined the efficacy rates in women on ert > or = 45 years (n = 40) compared to women > or = 45 years not on ert (n = 132) and to women < 45 years (n = 396) and to men (n = 262) with major depression during fluoxetine 20 mg daily up to 8 weeks. remitters with a ham-d17 score < or = 7 from week 9 to 12 were then treated up to 1-year in a placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial.   results efficacy rates were similar in women > or = 45 years on ert when compared to women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine alone, and when compared to women < 45 years and men taking fluoxetine. a kaplan-meier survival analysis in fluoxetine responders treated up to 26 weeks showed a somewhat greater relapse rate in women > or = 45 years taking ert compared to other treatment groups (p < 0.06).   limitations this study was retrospective nature and ert was given in an uncontrolled fashion: 63% of women received estrogen alone while 37% also took intermittent progesterone. other variables include the absence of hormonal documentation of menopausal status, no direct assessment of ert compliance and the use of fixed-dose fluoxetine 20 mg daily.   conclusion in contrast to prior reports suggesting that ert may facilitate antidepressant activity, we observed similar efficacy in depressed women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine plus ert compared to those taking fluoxetine alone.
research suggests that parental warmth and positive parent–child interactions predict the development of conscience and empathy. recent studies suggest that affective dimensions of parenting, including parental warmth, are associated with fewer behavior problems among children with high levels of callous-unemotional (cu) behavior. evidence also suggests that cu behavior confers risk for behavior problems by uniquely shaping parenting. the current study examines reciprocal associations between parental warmth, cu behavior, and behavior problems among toddlers. data from mother-child dyads (n = 731; 49 % female) were collected from a multi-ethnic, high-risk sample at ages 2 and 3. cu behavior was assessed using a previously validated measure (hyde et al. 2013). models were tested using two measures of parental warmth, the first from direct observations of warmth in the home, the second coded from 5-min speech samples. three-way cross-lagged, simultaneous effects models showed that parental warmth predicted child cu behavior, over and above associations with behavior problems. there were cross-lagged associations between directly observed parental warmth and child cu behavior, suggesting these behaviors show some malleability during toddlerhood and that parenting appears to reflect some adaptation to child behavior. the results have implications for models of early-starting behavior problems and preventative interventions for young children. seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
a comparative study on functional leaf treats and the diurnal dynamics of photosynthetic processes was conducted on 2-year-old potted plants of two grape (vitis vinifera l.) varieties (aleatico, ale, and trebbiano giallo, tre), exposed under controlled conditions to realistic concentrations of the pollutant gas ozone (80 ppb for 5 h day-1, 8:00–13:00 h, + 40 ppb for 5 h day-1, 13:00–18:00 h). at constitutive levels, the morphological functional traits of tre improved leaf resistance to gas exchange, suggesting that tre is characterized by a potential high degree of tolerance to ozone. at the end of the treatment, both varieties showed typical visible injuries on fully expanded leaves and a marked alteration in the diurnal pattern of photosynthetic activity. this was mainly due to a decreased stomatal conductance (-27 and -29% in ale and tre, in terms of daily values in comparison to controls) and to a reduced mesophyllic functioning (+33 and +16% of the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration). although the genotypic variability of grape regulates the response to oxidative stress, similar detoxification processes were activated, such as an increased content of total carotenoids (+64 and +30%, in ale and tre), enhanced efficiency of thermal energy dissipation within photosystem ii (+32 and +20%) closely correlated with the increased de-epoxidation index (+26 and +22%) and variations in content of some osmolytes. in summary, we can conclude that: the daily photosynthetic performance of grapevine leaves was affected by a realistic exposure to ozone. in addition, the gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements revealed a different quali-quantitative response in the two varieties. the genotypic variability of v. vinifera and the functional leaf traits would seem to regulate the acclimatory response to oxidative stress and the degree of tolerance to ozone. similar photoprotective mechanisms were activated in the two varieties, though to a different extent. using open-top chambers, the impact of ozone (o(3)) on foliar carboxylases of bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) was investigated. from sowing, beans were exposed to non-filtered air (nf) and nf supplied with 40 (+40) and 80 (+80) nl l(-1) o(3). twenty days after emergence, primary and first trifoliate leaves were sampled. biochemical characteristics of leaves from +40 were quite similar to those from nf. conversely, +80 induced distinct biochemical effects in primary and first trifoliate leaves. regarding primary leaves, +80 reduced ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) activity by 33% whereas it stimulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (pepc) activity by 376%. the reduction in rubisco activity was accompanied by a decrease in both rubisco subunit amounts and a consistent oxidative modification of the rubisco small subunit (ssu). these changes came with a drastic loss in pigmentation. regarding first trifoliate leaves, +80 stimulated rubisco activity by 33% while it disturbed neither pepc activity nor pigmentation. surprisingly, the enhanced rubisco activity was associated with a slight decrease in rubisco protein quantity, which was not coupled with the formation of carbonyl groups in rubisco-ssu.
we examined behaviour management problems as predictors of psychotropic medication, use of psychiatric consultation and in-patient admission in a group of 66 adults with pervasive developmental disorder (pdd) and intellectual disability (id) and 99 controls matched in age, gender and level of id. overall, people with pdd had higher rates of most das behaviour problems and more frequent use of anti-psychotics than matched controls. logistic regression analyses showed that physical aggression and problems such as pestering staff independently predicted use of anti-psychotics. physical aggression and overactivity predicted further involvement of psychiatric services. pdd diagnosis predicted admission to an in-patient unit. the results suggest that externalizing problem behaviours in adults with autism can predict type of treatment intervention. &na; research into the pharmacotherapy of autistic disorder has steadily increased over the past two decades. several psychoactive medications have shown efficacy for selected symptoms of autistic disorder and can be used to augment critical educational and behavioral interventions that are the mainstays of treatment. a comprehensive review of medication trials conducted in individuals with autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders is presented. the typical antipsychotic haloperidol is the best‐studied medication in autistic disorder but is associated with a high rate of dyskinesias. investigations to date suggest that the atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone have efficacy for certain symptoms of autistic disorder and may be better tolerated than typical antipsychotics. preliminary results from trials with serotonin‐reuptake inhibitors are favorable, although efficacy has not been demonstrated in younger age groups. recent controlled studies of naltrexone suggest that the drug has minimal efficacy. in two small controlled investigations, clonidine was more effective than placebo for a variety of symptoms, including hyperactivity and irritability; in one of these studies, however, the majority of patients relapsed within several months. psychostimulants reduced hyperactivity and irritability in one small double‐blind crossover study in children with autistic disorder, although these agents are frequently reported to exacerbate irritability, insomnia, and aggression in clinical populations. recent controlled trials of secretin have not shown efficacy compared to placebo. several other medications, including buspirone, mood stabilizers, and g ‐blockers, have produced symptom reduction in some open‐label studies and may warrant controlled investigation.
dialysis bags were used to examine the impact of predation and viral lysis on prokaryotic community composition (pcc) over a 5-day experiment in the oligomesotrophic lake pavin (france). the impact of the different predator communities (protists and metazoans) of prokaryotes was estimated by water fractionation (<5 μm: treatment filtered on 5 μm, without ciliates and metazoans; unf: unfiltered treatment with all planktonic communities). enrichments of natural viruses (<1.2 μm: with a natural virus concentration; <1.2 μm v and vv: with enrichment leading to a double or triple concentration of viruses, respectively) were used to indirectly assess the control of virioplankton. viral activity was estimated from the frequency of visibly infected cells (fvic). pcc was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp). in this study, pcc was affected by the eukaryote communities (especially flagellates), and viruses to a lesser extent. cyanobacteria declined significantly during the experiment and were highly correlated with the fvic. in addition, the 503-bp terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) disappeared in treatments with virus enrichments, suggesting possible viral-associated mortality processes, whereas the 506-bp t-rf was not affected in these treatments. on one hand, these results suggest a control of the pcc: first, by viral lysis of some dominant phylotypes and second, by interspecific competition between resistant strains for the uptake of substrates released by this lysis. the increase of archaea may suggest that these cells benefit such resources. on the other hand, the disappearance and the stable proportion of some dominant phylotypes suggested a selection pressure due to the predatory activity on prokaryotes. in conclusion, prokaryotic abundance appears to be mainly controlled by flagellate protists, which also affected pcc, whereas viruses seemed to be essentially responsible for profound changes in pcc via direct and indirect actions. viral lysis of specific bacterial populations has been suggested to be an important factor for structuring marine bacterioplankton communities. in the present study, the influence of bacteriophages on the diversity and population dynamics of four marine bacterial phage-host systems was studied experimentally in continuous cultures and theoretically by a mathematical model. by use of whole genome dna hybridization toward community dna, we analyzed the dynamics of individual bacterial host populations in response to the addition of their specific phage in continuous cultures of mixed bacterial assemblages. in these experiments, viral lysis had only temporary effects on the dynamics and diversity of the individual bacterial host species. following the initial lysis of sensitive host cells, growth of phage-resistant clones of the added bacteria resulted in a distribution of bacterial strains in the phage-enriched culture that was similar to that in the control culture without phages after about 50-60 h incubation. consequently, after a time frame of 5-10 generations after lysis, it was the interspecies competition rather than viral lysis of specific bacterial strains that was the driving force in the regulation of bacterial species composition in these experiments. the clonal diversity, on the other hand, was strongly influenced by viral activity, since the clonal composition of the four species in the phage-enriched culture changed completely from phage-sensitive to phage-resistant clones. the model simulation predicted that viral lysis had a strong impact on the population dynamics, the species composition, and the clonal composition of the bacterial community over longer time scales (weeks). however, according to the model, the overall density of bacteria in the system was not affected by phages, since resistant clones complemented the fluctuations caused by viral lysis. based on the model analysis, we therefore suggest that viral lysis can have a strong influence on the dynamics of bacterial populations in planktonic marine systems.
urinary albumin is an important biomarker used to identify high risk patients with diabetes, but there is a need for new biomarkers that alone or in combination with urinary albumin could give an even better prediction of clinical patient outcomes. one promising biomarker is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoguo) that represents intracellular oxidative stress. we investigated the ability of microalbuminuria (ma) and urinary 8-oxoguo, alone and in combination, to predict mortality and cardiovascular disease (cvd) in patients with type 2 diabetes. we used data from 1381 newly diagnosed diabetes patients, and urinary albumin and 8-oxoguo were assessed in morning urine collected at the time of diabetes diagnosis and at a follow-up visit 6 years later. associations between the urinary markers and mortality and cvd were assessed in cox proportional hazards regression models. test performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 10-year mortality and 10-year incidence of cvd. both 8-oxoguo and urinary albumin were statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality at diagnosis as well as at 6-year follow-up. at diagnosis only urinary albumin was associated with cvd. in contrast, only 8-oxoguo was associated with cvd at 6-year follow-up. when investigating test performance, we found that by combining information from ma and 8-oxoguo the ability to correctly identify patients at risk could be improved. the findings suggest that measurement of urinary 8-oxoguo provides additional information about risk to that obtained from urinary albumin, and that the combined use of 8-oxoguo and urinary albumin could be useful for a better identification of patients at risk of cvd and death. background—for the general population, the clinical relevance of an increased urinary albumin excretion rate is still debated. therefore, we examined the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and all-cause mortality and mortality caused by cardiovascular (cv) disease and non-cv disease in the general population. methods and results—in the period 1997 to 1998, all inhabitants of the city of groningen, the netherlands, aged between 28 and 75 years (n=85 421) were sent a postal questionnaire collecting information about risk factors for cv disease and cv morbidity and a vial to collect an early morning urine sample for measurement of urinary albumin concentration (uac). the vital status of the cohort was subsequently obtained from the municipal register, and the cause of death was obtained from the central bureau of statistics. of these 85 421 subjects, 40 856 (47.8%) responded, and 40 548 could be included in the analysis. during a median follow-up period of 961 days (maximum 1139 days), 516 deaths with known cause were recorded. we found a positive dose-response relationship between increasing uac and mortality. a higher uac increased the risk of both cv and non-cv death after adjustment for other well-recognized cv risk factors, with the increase being significantly higher for cv mortality than for non-cv mortality (p =0.014). a 2-fold increase in uac was associated with a relative risk of 1.29 for cv mortality (95% ci 1.18 to 1.40) and 1.12 (95% ci 1.04 to 1.21) for non-cv mortality. conclusions—urinary albumin excretion is a predictor of all-cause mortality in the general population. the excess risk was more attributable to death from cv causes, independent of the effects of other cv risk factors, and the relationship was already apparent at levels of albuminuria currently considered to be normal.
retrieval of spermatozoa is unfortunately still only successful in a subset of patients suffering from non‐obstructive azoospermia (noa) by conventional testicular sperm extraction (tese). microdissection tese may have some theoretical benefits over conventional tese, but uncertainty exists about its superiority. the objective of this systematic review was therefore to compare the efficacy and safety of microtese with conventional tese in men with noa. the systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis statement. literature was searched for studies comparing outcome of conventional tese with microdissection tese. primary outcome was sperm retrieval rate (srr). secondary outcomes were clinical predictors of sperm retrieval as well as complication rate. of 62 articles, a total of seven studies were included in the final analysis. overall srr was significantly higher in the microtese group in comparison with conventional tese in five of these studies. overall sperm retrieval ranged from 16.7 to 45% in the conventional tese vs. 42.9 to 63% in the microtese group. a sub‐analysis of the srr according to testicular histology was available in four of the selected articles. microtese in men with sertoli cell only syndrome and hypospermatogenesis carried a small but significant more favourable outcome according to, respectively, two and one of the studies. correlation of serum follicle stimulating hormone and testicular volume with positive outcome was variable. fewer complications were observed on ultrasound examination after microtese procedure. clinical randomized studies comparing microtese with conventional tese in noa are still lacking to date. pseudo‐randomized prospective data, however, show more favourable sperm retrieval in noa for microtese, especially in histological patterns of patchy spermatogenesis such as sertoli cell only syndrome. however, in patients with uniform histological patterns such as maturation arrest outcome of microtese seems less favourable. in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad) is caused by c. difficile toxins a and b and represents a serious emerging health problem. yet, its progression and functional consequences are unclear. we hypothesised that c. difficile can drive major measurable metabolic changes in the gut microbiota and that a relationship with the production or absence of toxins may be established. we tested this hypothesis by performing metabolic profiling on the gut microbiota of patients with c. difficile that produced (n=6) or did not produce (n=4) toxins and on non-colonised control patients (n=6), all of whom were experiencing diarrhoea. we report a statistically significant separation (p-value <0.05) among the three groups, regardless of patient characteristics, duration of the disease, antibiotic therapy and medical history. this classification is associated with differences in the production of distinct molecules with presumptive global importance in the gut environment, disease progression and inflammation. moreover, although severe impaired metabolite production and biological deficits were associated with the carriage of c. difficile that did not produce toxins, only previously unrecognised selective features, namely, choline- and acetylputrescine-deficient gut environments, characterised the carriage of toxin-producing c. difficile. additional results showed that the changes induced by c. difficile become marked at the highest level of the functional hierarchy, namely the metabolic activity exemplified by the gut microbial metabolome regardless of heterogeneities that commonly appear below the functional level (gut bacterial composition). we discuss possible explanations for this effect and suggest that the changes imposed by cdad are much more defined and predictable than previously thought. defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community–host interaction. metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to ‘fingerprint’ microbiota functional status. here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (hum) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based method. differences between hum and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota’s metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding hum mice, and individual-specific features suggest ‘personalized’ aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif), which inhibits apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis, is expressed in cancers suppressing immune surveillance. its biological role in human glioblastoma is, however, only poorly understood. we examined in-vivo expression of mif in 166 gliomas and 23 normal control brains by immunohistochemistry. mif immunoreactivity was enhanced in neoplastic astrocytes in who grade ii glioma and increased significantly in higher tumour grades (iii–iv). mif expression was further assessed in 12 glioma cell lines in vitro. quantitative rt-pcr showed that mif mrna expression was elevated up to 800-fold in malignant glioma cells compared with normal brain. this translated into high protein levels as assessed by immunoblotting of total cell lysates and by elisa-based measurement of secreted mif. wild-type p53-retaining glioma cell lines expressed higher levels of mif, which may be connected with the previously described role of mif as a negative regulator of wild-type p53 signalling in tumour cells. stable knockdown of mif by shrna in glioma cells significantly increased tumour cell susceptibility towards nk cell-mediated cytotoxicity. furthermore, supernatant from mock-transfected cells, but not from mif knockdown cells, induced downregulation of the activating immune receptor nkg2d on nk and cd8+ t cells. we thus propose that human glioma cell-derived mif contributes to the immune escape of malignant gliomas by counteracting nk and cytotoxic t-cell-mediated tumour immune surveillance. considering its further cell-intrinsic and extrinsic tumour-promoting effects and the availability of small molecule inhibitors, mif seems to be a promising candidate for future glioma therapy. macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) was originally identified several decades ago as a lymphokine-derived protein that inhibited monocyte migration. recently, it has been reported that mif has d-dopachrome tautomerase, phenylpyruvate tautomerase and thiol protein oxidoreductase activities, although the physiological significance of those activities is not yet clear. here we show that mif is able to catalyze the conversion of dopaminechrome and norepinephrinechrome, toxic quinone products of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, respectively, to indole derivatives that may serve as precursors to neuromelanin. since mif is highly expressed in human brain, these observations raise the possibility that mif participates in a detoxification pathway for catecholamine products and could therefore have an important role for neural tissues. the potential role of mif in the formation of neuromelanin from catecholamines is also an extremely interesting possibility.
the presence of lignin in secondary cell walls (scw) is a major factor preventing hydrolytic enzymes from gaining access to cellulose, thereby limiting the saccharification potential of plant biomass. to understand how lignification is regulated is a prerequisite for selecting plant biomass better adapted to bioethanol production. because transcriptional regulation is a major mechanism controlling the expression of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, our aim was to identify novel transcription factors (tfs) dictating lignin profiles in the model plant arabidopsis. to this end, we have developed a post-genomic approach by combining four independent in-house scw-related transcriptome datasets obtained from (1) the fiber cell wall-deficient wat1 arabidopsis mutant, (2) arabidopsis lines over-expressing either the master regulatory activator egmyb2 or (3) the repressor egmyb1 and finally (4) arabidopsis orthologs of eucalyptus xylem-expressed genes. this allowed us to identify 502 up- or down-regulated tfs. we preferentially selected those present in more than one dataset and further analyzed their in silico expression patterns as an additional selection criteria. this selection process led to 80 candidates. notably, 16 of them were already proven to regulate scw formation, thereby validating the overall strategy. then, we phenotyped 43 corresponding mutant lines focusing on histological observations of xylem and interfascicular fibers. this phenotypic screen revealed six mutant lines exhibiting altered lignification patterns. two of them [bel-like homeobox6 (blh6) and a zinc finger tf] presented hypolignified scw. three others (myb52, myb-like tf, hb5) showed hyperlignified scw whereas the last one (hb15) showed ectopic lignification. in addition, our meta-analyses highlighted a reservoir of new potential regulators adding to the gene network regulating scw but also opening new avenues to ultimately improve scw composition for biofuel production. members of the large arabidopsis nac domain transcription factor family are regulators of meristem development, organ elongation and separation, and deposition of patterned secondary cell walls. xylem nac domain 1 (xnd1) is highly expressed in xylem. changes observed for xnd1 knockout plants compared with wild-type arabidopsis thaliana included a reduction in both plant height and tracheary element length and an increase in metaxylem relative to protoxylem in roots of plants treated with the proteasome inhibitor mg132. overexpression of xnd1 resulted in extreme dwarfism associated with the absence of xylem vessels and little or no expression of tracheary element marker genes. in contrast, phloem marker-gene expression was not altered and phloem-type cells still formed. transmission electron microscopy showed that parenchyma-like cells in the incipient xylem zone in hypocotyls of xnd1 overexpressors lacked secondary wall thickenings and retained their cytoplasmic content. considered together, these findings suggest that xnd1 affects tracheary element growth through regulation of secondary wall synthesis and programmed cell death.
genexol-pm is a novel cremophor el-free polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel. this single arm, multicenter phase ii study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of genexol-pm in patients with histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer (mbc). forty-one women received genexol-pm by intravenous infusion at 300 mg/m2 over 3 h every 3 weeks without premedication until disease progression or intolerability. a total of 331 chemotherapy cycles were administered, with a median of 8 cycles per patient (range, 1–16). overall response rate was 58.5% (95% ci: 43.5–72.3) with 5 complete responses and 19 partial responses. thirty-seven patients who received genexol-pm as a first-line therapy for their metastatic disease showed a response rate of 59.5% (95% ci: 43.5–73.7), and two responses were reported in four patients treated in the second-line setting for their metastatic disease. the median time to progression (ttp) for all patients was 9.0 months (range, 1.0–17.0+ months). grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities included sensory peripheral neuropathy (51.2%), and myalgia (2.4%). eight patients (19.5%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions, with grade 3 in two patients. hematologic toxicities were grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (51.2 and 17.1%, respectively), and grade 1 and 2 thrombocytopenia (22.0%). notably, no febrile neutropenia was observed. genexol-pm appears a promising new paclitaxel in view of significant efficacies. further trials with different dosing schedules, durations of delivery, or in combination with other drugs are warranted. purpose between february 1993 and september 1995, 739 patients with metastatic breast cancer were entered on an intergroup trial (e1193) comparing doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)), paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)/24 h), and the combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel (at, 50 mg/m(2) and 150 mg/m(2)/24 h, plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 mg/kg) as first-line therapy. patients receiving single-agent doxorubicin or paclitaxel were crossed over to the other agent at time of progression.   patients and methods patients were well balanced for on-study characteristics.   results responses (complete response and partial response) were seen in 36% of doxorubicin, 34% of paclitaxel, and 47% of at patients (p =.84 for doxorubicin v paclitaxel, p =.007 for v at, p =.004 for paclitaxel v at). median time to treatment failure (ttf) is 5.8, 6.0, and 8.0 months for doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and at, respectively (p =.68 for doxorubicin v paclitaxel, p =.003 for doxorubicin v at, p =.009 for paclitaxel v at). median survivals are 18.9 months for patients taking doxorubicin, 22.2 months for patients taking paclitaxel, and 22.0 months for patients taking at (p = not significant). responses were seen in 20% of patients crossing from doxorubicin --> paclitaxel and 22% of patients crossing from paclitaxel --> doxorubicin (p = not significant). changes in global quality-of-life measurements from on-study to week 16 were similar in all three groups.   conclusion (1) doxorubicin and paclitaxel, in the doses used here, have equivalent activity; (2) the combination of at results in superior overall response rates and time to ttf; and (3) despite these results, combination therapy with at did not improve either survival or quality of life compared to sequential single-agent therapy.
to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of different doses of tofogliflozin, a novel, highly selective sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (sglt2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). aims/hypothesisthe aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin vs placebo and sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with background metformin.methodsthis randomised, double-blind, four-arm, parallel-group, phase 3 study was conducted at 169 centres in 22 countries between april 2010 and august 2012. participants (n = 1,284) with type 2 diabetes aged ≥18 and ≤80 years who had inadequate glycaemic control (hba1c ≥7.0% [53 mmol/mol] and ≤10.5% [91 mmol/mol]) on metformin therapy received canagliflozin 100 mg or 300 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or placebo (n = 368, 367, 366, 183, respectively) for a 26 week, placebo- and active-controlled period followed by a 26 week, active-controlled period (placebo group switched to sitagliptin [placebo/sitagliptin]) and were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis set. randomisation was performed using a computer-generated schedule; participants, study centres and the sponsor were blinded to group assignment. the primary endpoint was change from baseline in hba1c at week 26; secondary endpoints included changes in hba1c (week 52) and fasting plasma glucose (fpg), body weight, and systolic blood pressure (bp; weeks 26 and 52). adverse events (aes) were recorded throughout the study.resultsat week 26, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg reduced hba1c vs placebo (−0.79%, –0.94%, –0.17%, respectively; p < 0.001). at week 52, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg demonstrated non-inferiority, and canagliflozin 300 mg demonstrated statistical superiority, to sitagliptin in lowering hba1c (−0.73%, –0.88%,–0.73%, respectively); differences (95% ci) vs sitagliptin were 0% (−0.12, 0.12) and −0.15% (−0.27, –0.03), respectively. canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg reduced body weight vs placebo (week 26: –3.7%, –4.2%, –1.2%, respectively; p < 0.001) and sitagliptin (week 52: –3.8%, –4.2%, –1.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). both canagliflozin doses reduced fpg and systolic bp vs placebo (week 26) and sitagliptin (week 52) (p < 0.001). overall ae and ae-related discontinuation rates were generally similar across groups, but higher with canagliflozin 100 mg. genital mycotic infection and osmotic diuresis-related ae rates were higher with canagliflozin; few led to discontinuations. hypoglycaemia incidence was higher with canagliflozin.conclusions/interpretationcanagliflozin improved glycaemia and reduced body weight vs placebo (week 26) and sitagliptin (week 52) and was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin.clinical trial registryclinicaltrials.gov nct01106677fundingthis study was supported by janssen research & development, llc.
abstractthe inhibition of motor behavior in rodents caused by the exposure to plant or synthetic cannabinoids has been reported to develop tolerance after repeated exposure. this tolerance seems to have a pharmacodynamic basis, since downregulation of cannabinoid receptors in motor areas, basal ganglia and cerebellum, has been demonstrated in cannabinoid-tolerant rats. the present study was designed to further explore this previous evidence by analyzing simultaneously in several motor areas of δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol-(δ9-thc)-tolerant rats:1.cannabinoid receptor binding, by using [3h]win-55,212-2 autoradiography;2.cannabinoid receptor activation of signal transduction mechanisms, by using win-55,212-2-stimulated [35s]-guanylyl-5′-o-(γ-thio)-triphosphate ([35s]-gtpγs) autoradiography;3.cannabinoid receptor mrna expression, quantitated by in situ hybridization.  results were as follows. as expected, the exposure to δ9-thc for 5 d resulted in a decrease of cannabinoid receptor binding in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, medial, and lateral caudate-putamen and, in particular, entopeduncular nucleus. we also found decreased cannabinoid receptor binding in the superficial and deep layers of the cerebral cortex, two regions used as a reference to test the specificity of changes observed in motor areas. there were only two brain regions, the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra, where the specific binding for cannabinoid receptors was unaltered after 5 d of a daily δ9-thc administration. however, in the substantia nigra, the magnitude of win-55,212-2-stimulated [35s]-gtpγs binding was lesser in δ9-thc-tolerant rats than controls, thus suggesting a possible specific change at the level of receptor coupling to gtp-binding proteins. this was not seen neither in the globus pallidus nor in the lateral caudate-putamen, where agonist stimulation produced similar [35s]-gtpγs binding levels in δ9-thc-tolerant rats and controls. finally, animals chronically exposed to δ9-thc also exhibited a decrease in the levels of cannabinoid receptor mrna in the medial and lateral caudate-putamen, but there were no changes in the cerebellum (granular layer) and cerebral cortex. in summary, the chronic exposure to δ9-thc resulted in a decrease in cannabinoid receptor binding and mrna levels in the caudate-putamen, where cell bodies of cannabinoid receptor-containing neurons in the basal ganglia are located. however, this decrease particularly affected the receptor binding levels in those neurons projecting to the entopeduncular nucleus, but not in those projecting to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, although, in this last region, a specific decrease in the efficiency of receptor activation of signal transduction mechanisms was seen in δ9-thc-tolerant rats. the chronic exposure to δ9-thc also resulted in decreased cannabinoid receptor binding in the cerebellum, although without affecting mrna expression. the active ingredient of marijuana is (-)-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-thc). delta 9-thc and other natural and synthetic cannabinoids such as cp-55,940 inhibit spontaneous activity and produce catalepsy in animals in a receptor-mediated fashion. tolerance develops to the motor effects of delta 9-thc after repeated administration. to test the hypothesis that tolerance is mediated by changes in cannabinoid receptor binding characteristics, we used quantitative in vitro autoradiography of [3h]cp-55,940 binding to striatal brain sections from rats treated either chronically or acutely with delta 9-thc, cp-55,940, or the inactive natural cannabinoid cannabidiol. in the chronic conditions, rats were given daily i.p. injections of delta 9-thc (10 mg/kg), cannabidiol (10 mg/kg), or cp-55,940 (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks and sacrificed 30 min after the last injection. in the acute condition, animals received a single dose (10 mg/kg) prior to sacrifice. rats developed tolerance to the inhibitory effects of delta 9-thc and cp-55,940, assayed in an open field on days 1, 7, and 14. cannabidiol had no effect on behavior. densitometry of [3h]cp-55,940 binding to brain sections showed that delta 9-thc- and cp-55,940-treated animals had homogeneous decreases in binding in all structures measured at the selected striatal levels. cannabidiol had no effect on binding. analysis of binding parameters showed that alterations in the acute condition were attributed to changes in affinity (kd), whereas the major changes in the chronic condition were attributed to a lowering of capacity (bmax). the effects in the 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg cp-55,940 conditions were dose-dependent and paralleled the behavioral data showing that the animals given the highest dose developed the greatest degree of tolerance. the data suggest that tolerance to cannabinoids results at least in part from agonist-induced receptor down-regulation.
we have developed a 12-item questionnaire for patients having a total knee replacement (tkr). we made a prospective study of 117 patients before operation and at follow-up six months later, asking them to complete the new questionnaire and the form sf36. some also filled in the stanford health assessment questionnaire (haq). an orthopaedic surgeon completed the american knee society (aks) clinical score. the single score derived from the new questionnaire had high internal consistency, and its reproducibility, examined by test-retest reliability, was found to be satisfactory. its validity was established by obtaining significant correlations in the expected direction with the aks scores and the relevant parts of the sf36 and haq. sensitivity to change was assessed by analysing the differences between the preoperative scores and those at follow-up. we also compared change in scores with the patients' retrospective judgement of change in their condition. the effect size for the new questionnaire compared favourably with those for the relevant parts of the sf36. the change scores for the new knee questionnaire were significantly greater (p < 0.0001) for patients who reported the most improvement in their condition. the new questionnaire provides a measure of outcome for tkr that is short, practical, reliable, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes over time.

liver x receptors (lxrs) are ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily. they play important roles in controlling cholesterol homeostasis and as regulators of inflammatory gene expression and innate immunity, by blunting the induction of classical pro-inflammatory genes. however, opposite data have also been reported on the consequences of lxr activation by oxysterols, resulting in the specific production of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ros). the effect of the inflammatory state on the expression of lxrs has not been studied in human cells, and constitutes the main aim of the present work. our data show that when human neutrophils are triggered with synthetic ligands, the synthesis of lxrα mrna became activated together with transcription of the lxr target genes abca1, abcg1 and srebp1c. an inflammatory mediator, 15-deoxy-δ12,14-prostaglandin j2 (15dpgj2), hindered t0901317-promoted induction of lxrα mrna expression together with transcription of its target genes in both neutrophils and human macrophages. this down-regulatory effect was dependent on the release of reactive oxygen species elicited by 15dpgj2, since it was enhanced by pro-oxidant treatment and reversed by antioxidants, and was also mediated by erk1/2 activation. present data also support that the 15dpgj2-induced serine phosphorylation of the lxrα molecule is mediated by erk1/2. these results allow to postulate that down-regulation of lxr cellular levels by pro-inflammatory stimuli might be involved in the development of different vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis. 15-deoxy-δ12,14-prostaglandin j2 (15dpgj2 has been recently proposed as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. however, the mechanisms by which 15dpgj2 mediates its therapeutic effects in vivo are unclear. we demonstrate that 15dpgj2 at micromolar (2.5–10 μm) concentrations induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1), an anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both mrna and protein levels in human lymphocytes. in contrast, troglitazone and ciglitazone, two thiazolidinediones that mimic several effects of 15dpgj2 through their binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-γ, did not affect ho-1 expression, and the positive effect of 15dpgj2 on this process was mimicked instead by other cyclopentenone prostaglandins (pg), such as pgd2 (the precursor of 15dpgj2) and pga1 and pga2 which do not interact with ppar-γ. also, 15dpgj2 enhanced the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and increased xanthine oxidase activity in vitro. inhibition of intracellular ros production by n-acetylcysteine, tempo, me2so, 1,10-phenanthroline, or allopurinol resulted in a decreased 15dpgj2-dependent ho-1 expression in the cells. furthermore, buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of reduced glutathione synthesis, or fe2+/cu2+ ions enhanced the positive effect of 15dpgj2 on ho-1 expression. on the other hand, the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, or the blockade of transcription factor nf-κb activation, hindered 15dpgj2-elicited ho-1 expression. collectively, the present data suggest that 15dpgj2 anti-inflammatory actions at pharmacological concentrations involve the induction of ho-1 gene expression through mechanisms independent of ppar-γ activation and dependent on ros produced via the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and/or through fenton reactions. both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways also appear implicated in modulation of ho-1 expression by 15dpgj2.
among many applications of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mabs), a unique approach for regenerative medicine has entailed antibody-mediated osseous regeneration (amor). in an effort to identify a clinically relevant model of craniofacial defect, the present study investigated the efficacy of mab specific for bone morphogenetic protein- (bmp-) 2 to repair canine segmental mandibular continuity defect model. accordingly, a 15 mm unilateral segmental defect was created in mandible and fixated with a titanium plate. anorganic bovine bone mineral with 10% collagen (abbm-c) was functionalized with 25 μg/ml of either chimeric anti-bmp-2 mab or isotype-matched mab (negative control). recombinant human (rh) bmp-2 served as positive control. morphometric analyses were performed on computed tomography (ct) and histologic images. bone densities within healed defect sites at 12 weeks after surgery were 1360.81 ± 10.52 hounsfield unit (hu), 1044.27 ± 141.16 hu, and 839.45 ± 179.41 hu, in sites with implanted anti-bmp-2 mab, rhbmp-2, and isotype mab groups, respectively. osteoid bone formation in anti-bmp-2 mab (42.99% ± 8.67) and rhbmp-2 (48.97% ± 2.96) groups was not significantly different but was higher (p < 0.05) than in sites with isotype control mab (26.8% ± 5.35). in view of the long-term objective of translational application of amor in humans, the results of the present study demonstrated the feasibility of amor in a large clinically relevant animal model. recently, it has been shown that tethered anti-bmp2 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) can trap bmp ligands and thus provide bmp inductive signals for osteo-differentiation of progenitor cells. the objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a co-delivery system based on murine anti-bmp2 mab-loaded alginate microspheres encapsulating human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hbmmscs); and (2) investigate osteogenic differentiation of encapsulated stem cells in alginate microspheres in vitro and in vivo. alginate microspheres of 1 ± 0.1 mm diameter were fabricated with 2 × 10(6) hbmmscs per ml of alginate. critical-size calvarial defects (5 mm diameter) were created in immune-compromised mice and alginate microspheres preloaded with anti-bmp mab encapsulating hbmmscs were transplanted into defect sites. alginate microspheres pre-loaded with isotype-matched non-specific antibody were used as the negative control. after 8 weeks, micro ct and histologic analyses were used to analyze bone formation. in vitro analysis demonstrated that anti-bmp2 mabs tethered bmp2 ligands that can activate the bmp receptors on hbmmscs. the co-delivery system described herein, significantly enhanced hbmmsc-mediated osteogenesis, as confirmed by the presence of bmp signal pathway-activated osteoblast determinants runx2 and alp. our results highlight the importance of engineering the microenvironment for stem cells, and particularly the value of presenting inductive signals for osteo-differentiation of hbmmscs by tethering bmp ligands using mabs. this strategy of engineering the microenvironment with captured bmp signals is a promising modality for repair and regeneration of craniofacial, axial and appendicular bone defects.
objectivesto examine the association between body composition (fat mass, lean mass and body mass index, bmi) and bone health (bone mineral density, bmd and fracture risk) in urban black south african women.designa cross sectional study examining associations between body composition, dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire), habitual physical activity (activity energy expenditure (aee) measured using an accelerometer with combined heart rate monitor and physical activity questionnaire) and bone health (bmd using dual-energy x ray absorptiometry, dxa and fracture risk).settingurban community dwellers from ikageng in the north-west province of south africa.participantsone hundred and eighty nine (189) healthy postmenopausal women aged ≥43 years.resultsfat mass and lean mass were significantly associated with bmd and fracture risk when adjusted for potential confounders. however, lean mass and not fat mass remained significantly associated with femoral neck bmd (β = 0.49, p <0.001), spine bmd (β = 0.48, p< 0.0001) and hip bmd (β = 0.59, p< 0.0001). lean mass was also negatively associated with fracture risk (β = −0.19 p =0.04) when both lean and fat mass were in the same model.conclusionlean mass and fat mass were positively associated with femoral neck, spine and hip bmds and negatively associated with fracture risk in urban black south african women. our finding suggests that increasing lean mass rather than fat mass is beneficial to bone health. our study emphasises the importance of positive lifestyle changes, intake of calcium from dairy and adequate weight to maintain and improve bone health of postmenopausal women. background the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral density (bmd) in postmenopausal and perimenopausal thai women. methods a cross-sectional study was conducted in 1579 healthy thai women aged 40–90 years. total body, lumbar spine, total femur, and femoral neck bmd and body composition were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. to evaluate the associations between fat mass and lean mass and various measures of bmd, multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the regression coefficients for fat mass and lean mass, first in separate equations and then with both fat mass and lean mass in the same equation. results among the study population, 1448 subjects (91.7%) were postmenopausal and 131 (8.3%) were perimenopausal. in postmenopausal women, after controlling for age, height, and duration of menopause, both fat mass and lean mass were positively correlated with bmd when they were analyzed independently of each other. when included in the same equation, both fat mass and lean mass continued to show a positive effect, but lean mass had a significantly greater impact on bmd than fat mass at all regions except for total body. lean mass but not fat mass had a positive effect on bmd at all skeletal sites except the lumbar spine, after controlling for age and height in perimenopausal women. conclusion lean mass had a significant beneficial effect on bmd in both postmenopausal and perimenopausal women and can be considered as one of the determinants of bone mass. the effect of the fat mass was related to menopausal status, but only demonstrated a positive impact in perimenopausal women.
thiol/disulfide interchange is one of the most common routes of aggregation of lyophilized protein drug products, but the mechanisms of the reaction in the solid state have not been established. here, we report perturbations in thiol/disulfide interchange upon lyophilization, using tocionic acid (cyclocyiqnc; ta(ox)) and glutathione (gsh) as model peptides. the results suggest that thiol/disulfide interchange reactions differ in aqueous solution and in dry lyophilized solids with regard to reversibility and regioselectivity. in solids, the reaction of ta(ox) with gsh is effectively irreversible and the less-hindered single mixed disulfide is formed exclusively. methodology is described for characterization of the kinetics and equilibria of thiol/disulfide interchange reactions of the disulfide bonds in the neurohypophyseal peptide hormones arginine vasopressin and oxytocin and the related peptides pressinoic acid and tocinoic acid. thiol/disulfide interchange reaction mixtures are analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. the effect of mobile-phase composition and ph on the hplc capacity factors for the native disulfide and reduced dithiol forms of each peptide was examined. in each case, the capacity factor decreases as the acetonitrile content of the mobile phase increases. for each disulfide/dithiol peptide pair, the capacity factor is larger for the dithiol form of the peptide, indicating that the hydrophobic side chains of the linear peptide are more accessible for interaction with the hydrophobic stationary phase. to illustrate application of the methodology, rate and equilibrium constants are reported for the thiol/disulfide interchange reactions of cysteine with arginine vasopressin at ph 7.0. cysteine reacts with arginine vasopressin to form two mixed disulfides, which in turn react with another molecule of cysteine to give the dithiol form of arginine vasopressin and cystine. rate and equilibrium constants were determined for each step by analysis of reaction mixtures by hplc. the results are compared to rate and equilibrium constants for reaction of cysteine with oxidized glutathione.
although hypoxia tolerance in heterothermic mammals is well established, it is unclear whether the adaptive significance stems from hypoxia or other cellular challenge associated with euthermy, hibernation, or arousal. in the present study, blood gases, hemoglobin o2 saturation (s(o2), and indexes of cellular and physiological stress were measured during hibernation and euthermy and after arousal thermogenesis. results show that arterial o2 tension (pa(o2)) and s(o2) are severely diminished during arousal and that hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1alpha accumulates in brain. despite evidence of hypoxia, neither cellular nor oxidative stress, as indicated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) levels and oxidative modification of biomolecules, was observed during late arousal from hibernation. compared with rats, hibernating arctic ground squirrels (spermophilus parryii) are well oxygenated with no evidence of cellular stress, inflammatory response, neuronal pathology, or oxidative modification following the period of high metabolic demand necessary for arousal. in contrast, euthermic arctic ground squirrels experience mild, chronic hypoxia with low s(o2) and accumulation of hif-1alpha and inos and demonstrate the greatest degree of cellular stress in brain. these results suggest that arctic ground squirrels experience and tolerate endogenous hypoxia during euthermy and arousal. venous and arterial blood gases in hibernating and normothermic ground squirrels, showing venous oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures reduction in hibernation
modifying behavior to maximize reward is integral to adaptive decision-making. in rodents, the μ-opioid receptor (mor) system encodes motivation and preference for high-value rewards. yet it remains unclear whether and how human mors contribute to value-based decision-making. we reasoned that if the human mor system modulates value-based choice, this would be reflected by opposite effects of agonist and antagonist drugs. in a double-blind pharmacological cross-over study, 30 healthy men received morphine (10 mg), placebo, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone (50 mg). they completed a two-alternative decision-making task known to induce a considerable bias towards the most frequently rewarded response option. to quantify mor involvement in this bias, we fitted accuracy and reaction time data with the drift–diffusion model (ddm) of decision-making. the ddm analysis revealed the expected bidirectional drug effects for two decision subprocesses. mor stimulation with morphine increased the preference for the stimulus with high-reward probability (shift in starting point). compared to placebo, morphine also increased, and naltrexone reduced, the efficiency of evidence accumulation. since neither drug affected motor-coordination, speed-accuracy trade-off, or subjective state (indeed participants were still blinded after the third session), we interpret the mor effects on evidence accumulation efficiency as a consequence of changes in effort exerted in the task. together, these findings support a role for the human mor system in value-based choice by tuning decision-making towards high-value rewards across stimulus domains. decision-making consists of selecting an action from a set of available options. this results in an outcome that changes the state of the decision-maker. therefore, decision-making is part of a homeostatic process. individuals with psychiatric disorders show altered decision-making. they select options that are either non-optimal or nonhomeostatic. these dysfunctional patterns of decision-making in individuals with psychiatric disorders may fundamentally relate to problems with homeostatic regulation. these may manifest themselves in (i) how the length of time between decisions and their outcomes influences subsequent decision-making, (ii) how gain and loss feedback are integrated to determine the optimal decision, (iii) how individuals adapt their decision strategies to match the specific context, or (iv) how seemingly maladaptive responses result from an attempt to establish an unstable homeostatic balance.
the word ‘‘associate’’ is incorrect in the article title. the correct title is: genetic variants in microrna machinery genes are associated with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss risk. the correct citation is: jung yw, jeon yj, rah h, kim jh, shin je, et al. (2014) genetic variants in microrna machinery genes are associated with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss risk. plos one 9(4): e95803. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095803 recent compelling evidence indicates that mutation, aberrant expression, and dysregulation of microrna (mirna) biogenesis are implicated in cancer development and progression. based on the important role of mirna biogenesis pathway in carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that genetic variations in this pathway genes may play a role as susceptibility factors for breast cancer. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the associations between 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in 14 genes involved in mirna biogenesis pathway and breast cancer risk in a case–control study of 559 korean breast cancer cases and 567 controls frequency-matched by age. in all women, 3 snps (ago1 rs595055, ago2 rs3864659, and p68 rs1991401) were significantly associated with breast cancer risk. in stratified analysis by menopausal status, altered risk associations were observed for 7 snps in postmenopausal breast cancer. when subjects were grouped by the number of high-risk genotypes, we found a progressive increase in gene-dosage effect (ptrend = 9.46e−7). the protective effects of ago2 rs3864659 and hiwi rs11060845 were more pronounced in progesterone receptor-positive (pr+) cancer than in progesterone receptor-negative (pr−) cancer (odds ratio (or), 0.50; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.30–0.84 vs. or, 0.94; 95% ci, 0.60–1.84; pheterogeneity = 0.04 and or, 0.57; 95% ci, 0.37–0.88 vs. or, 0.97; 95% ci, 0.65–1.44; pheterogeneity = 0.02, respectively), and the drosha rs644236 had stronger association with estrogen receptor-negative (er−) cancer than for estrogen receptor-positive (er+) cancer (or, 1.39; 95% ci, 1.08–1.78 vs. or, 1.05; 95% ci, 0.85–1.29; pheterogeneity = 0.04). our results suggest that genetic variants in mirna biogenesis pathway genes may be associated with breast cancer risk, and the modifiable effects might be different according to the menopausal status and hormone receptor status.
flagellar movement is caused by the coordinated activity of outer and inner dynein arms, which induces sliding between doublet microtubules. in trypsin-treated flagellar axonemes, microtubule sliding induced by atp is faster in the presence than in the absence of the outer arms. to elucidate the mechanism by which the outer arms regulate microtubule sliding, we studied the effect of trypsin-digested outer-arm fragments on the velocity of microtubule sliding in elastase-treated axonemes of sea urchin sperm flagella. we found that microtubule sliding was significantly slower in elastase-treated axonemes than in trypsin-treated axonemes, and that this difference disappeared after the complete removal of the outer arms. after about 95% of the outer arms were removed, however, the velocity of sliding induced by elastase and atp increased significantly by adding outer arms that had been treated with trypsin in the presence of atp. the increase in sliding velocity did not occur in the elastase-treated axonemes from which the outer arms had been completely removed. among the outer arm fragments obtained by trypsin treatment, a polypeptide of about 350 kda was found to be possibly involved in the regulation of sliding velocity. these results suggest that the velocity of sliding in the axonemes with only inner arms is similar to that in the axonemes with both inner and outer arms, and that the 350 kda fragment, probably of the alpha heavy chains, increases the sliding activity of the intact outer and inner arms on the doublet microtubules. conformational changes of dynein during atp hydrolysis are demonstrated by the difference in the tryptic fragments of the dynein heavy chain between in the absence and presence of atp and vanadate. here tryptic sites in the presence of atp and vanadate (tav sites) have been mapped on the betaheavy chain of outer arm dynein from sea urchin sperm flagella. tav sites are located not only near the central catalytic domain which includes four p-loops, but also near the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region. the tav2 site is located in the most carboxyl-terminal region, which is nearly 850 amino acid residues apart from the the fourth p-loop (p4 site). the region from the most amino-terminal tav site (tav1 site) to the tav2 site covers approximately 2,100 amino acid residues, which is almost half the whole betaheavy chain. comparison of the sequences around the tryptic sites of the sea urchin b chain and those of the dynein heavy chains from other organisms reveals that the sequence around the tav1 site is highly conserved in both cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins but that around tav2 sites is only conserved in axonemal dyneins, suggesting functional differences in the tav2 region between the two subfamilies of dynein.
this study was conducted to determine the effects of heat stress on ph, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and functionalities of breast meat in broilers. the experimental birds were exposed to 2 temperatures: 24 degrees c (control) and 41 degrees c (heat-stressed) for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h. as compared with control, the ph determinations after slaughter for 30 min and 24 h of chilling, respectively, of the pectoralis major in the heat-stressed groups were significantly lower (p < 0.05). oxidative stability of i.m. lipid in 3- and 5-h groups (p < 0.01) and protein in 2-, 3-, and 5-h groups (p < 0.01) increased. protein solubility of pectorilas major decreased after heat exposure. drip loss and cooking loss were increased in groups from 1 to 5 h of exposure. a reduced strength was noted for myofibrillar protein gels of heat-stressed breasts in exposed groups (p < 0.01); also water-holding capacity of the gels was reduced in treatments of 2, 3, and 5 h (p < 0.01). the results demonstrated that preslaughter exposures to heat reduced the oxidative stability of broiler muscle protein, which might be responsible for decreased protein functionalities such as gelation. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chemical oxidation on proteolysis susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins. myofibrils were prepared from pig m. longissimus dorsi and oxidised by a hydroxyl radical generating system. protein oxidation level was measured by the carbonyl content, free thiol group content and bityrosine formation. oxidised or non-oxidised myofibrillar proteins were exposed to papain and proteolysis was estimated by fluorescence using fluorescamine. oxidation of myofibrillar proteins was dependent upon the oxidising agent concentration. disulfide bridge and bityrosine formation indicated that oxidation by oh° can induce protein polymerization. electrophoretic study showed that myosin was the protein most sensitive to oxidation. results showed a direct and quantitative relationship between protein damages by hydroxyl radical and decreased proteolytic susceptibility. electrophoretic observations suggest that polymerization and aggregation may explain in part decreased susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins to proteolysis.
summary cortical computation arises from the interaction of multiple neuronal types, including pyramidal (pyr) cells and interneurons expressing sst, vip, or pvalb. to study the circuit underlying such interactions, we imaged these four types of cells in mouse primary visual cortex (v1). our recordings in darkness were consistent with a “disinhibitory” model in which locomotion activates vip cells, thus inhibiting sst cells and disinhibiting pyr cells. however, the disinhibitory model failed when visual stimuli were present: locomotion increased sst cell responses to large stimuli and vip cell responses to small stimuli. a recurrent network model successfully predicted each cell type’s activity from the measured activity of other types. capturing the effects of locomotion, however, required allowing it to increase feedforward synaptic weights and modulate recurrent weights. this network model summarizes interneuron interactions and suggests that locomotion may alter cortical computation by changing effective synaptic connectivity. the brain's response to sensory input is strikingly modulated by behavioral state. notably, the visual response of mouse primary visual cortex (v1) is enhanced by locomotion, a tractable and accessible example of a time-locked change in cortical state. the neural circuits that transmit behavioral state to sensory cortex to produce this modulation are unknown. in vivo calcium imaging of behaving animals revealed that locomotion activates vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip)-positive neurons in mouse v1 independent of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from basal forebrain. optogenetic activation of vip neurons increased v1 visual responses in stationary awake mice, artificially mimicking the effect of locomotion, and photolytic damage of vip neurons abolished the enhancement of v1 responses by locomotion. these findings establish a cortical circuit for the enhancement of visual response by locomotion and provide a potential common circuit for the modulation of sensory processing by behavioral state.
study hypothesis is the c-jun-n-terminal kinase (jnk) pathway implicated in primordial follicle activation?   study finding culture of ovine ovarian cortex in the presence of two different c-jun phosphorylation inhibitors impeded pre-antral follicle activation.   what is known already despite its importance for fertility preservation therapies, the mechanisms of primordial follicle activation are poorly understood. amongst different signalling pathways potentially involved, the jnk pathway has been previously shown to be essential for cell cycle progression and pre-antral follicle development in mice.   study design, samples/materials, methods ovine ovarian cortex pieces were cultured with varying concentrations of sp600125, jnk inhibitor viii or anti-mullerian hormone (amh) in the presence of fsh for 9 days. follicular morphometry and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), apoptosis and follicle activation (foxo3a) were assessed.   main results and the role of chance inhibition of primordial follicle activation occurred in the presence of sp600125, jnk inhibitor viii and amh when compared with controls (all p < 0.05) after 2 days of culture. however, only in the highest concentrations used was the inhibition of activation associated with induction of follicular apoptosis (p < 0.05). in growing follicles, pcna antigen expression was reduced when the jnk inhibitors or amh were used (p < 0.05 versus control), indicating reduced proliferation of the somatic compartment.   limitations, reasons for caution although we evaluated the effects of inhibition of c-jun phosphorylation on primordial follicle development, we did not determine the cellular targets and mechanism of action of the inhibitors.   wider implications of the findings these results are the first to implicate the jnk pathway in primordial follicle activation and could have significant consequences for the successful development of fertility preservation strategies and our understanding of primordial follicle activation.   large scale data n/a.   study funding and competing interests dr michael j. bertoldo and the laboratories involved in the present study were supported by a grant from 'région centre' (cryovaire, grant number #320000268). there are no conflicts of interest to declare. foxo transcription factors have been implicated in diverse biological processes, including metabolism, cellular stress responses, and aging. here, we show that foxo3a–/– female mice exhibit a distinctive ovarian phenotype of global follicular activation leading to oocyte death, early depletion of functional ovarian follicles, and secondary infertility. foxo3a thus functions at the earliest stages of follicular growth as a suppressor of follicular activation. in addition to providing a molecular entry point for studying the regulation of follicular growth, these results raise the possibility that accelerated follicular initiation plays a role in premature ovarian failure, a common cause of infertility and premature aging in women.
down syndrome (ds) is the leading chromosomal cause of intellectual disability, yet the neural substrates of learning and memory deficits remain poorly understood. here, we interrogate neural networks linked to learning and memory in a well-characterized model of ds, the ts65dn mouse. we report that ts65dn mice exhibit exploratory behavior that is not different from littermate wild-type (wt) controls yet behavioral activation of arc mrna transcription in pyramidal neurons of the ca1 region of the hippocampus is altered in ts65dn mice. in wt mice, a 5 min period of exploration of a novel environment resulted in arc mrna transcription in 39% of ca1 neurons. by contrast, the same period of exploration resulted in only ~20% of ca1 neurons transcribing arc mrna in ts65dn mice indicating increased sparsity of the behaviorally induced ensemble. like wt mice the ca1 pyramidal neurons of ts65dn mice reactivated arc transcription during a second exposure to the same environment 20 min after the first experience, but the size of the reactivated ensemble was only ~60% of that in wt mice. after repeated daily exposures there was a further decline in the size of the reactivated ensemble in ts65dn and a disruption of reactivation. together these data demonstrate reduction in the size of the behaviorally induced network that expresses arc in ts65dn mice and disruption of the long-term stability of the ensemble. we propose that these deficits in network formation and stability contribute to cognitive symptoms in ds. we have assessed the effects of enriched environment (ee) upon behavioral and cognitive performances of partially trisomic ts65dn (ts) mice and their control (co) littermates. enriched environment was applied to pups for 7 weeks after weaning. circadian spontaneous activity (actimetry), exploratory behavior (hole board), activity in the open field and spatial memory (morris water maze, repeated acquisition and cued paradigms) were analyzed in 86 female and 75 male mice, starting 15 days after completing enrichment. for each gender, mice were distributed in non-enriched and enriched control and trisomic groups. enriched environment reduced in trisomic females and enhanced in trisomic males' circadian activity. exploratory behavior was increased by enrichment in all groups, regardless of gender or presence of trisomy. in the morris water maze, a significant improvement of the spatial memory was observed in enriched-control females, but not in enriched-control male mice, as assessed by distances traveled. performances in the four groups of control animals were also consistently and significantly better than those of matching trisomic mice. in the acquisition trials, enrichment improved performance in trisomic female animals, but deteriorated in trisomic male mice. in all groups, changes in escape latencies and distances induced by enrichment were accounted for by changes in the total time spent in the periphery of the pool, indicating changes in learning strategy. working memory was the function more affected by enrichment. it is concluded that enriched environment induces behavioral and learning changes in trisomic mice, although gender plays a significant modulatory role.
aims and objectives: to assess and compare the tobacco use prevalence; to understand and compare attitudes and knowledge related to tobacco use and its health impact among urban and rural students; and to assess urban and rural disparity in the use of tobacco among 12 and 15-year-old adolescents in the urban and rural schools in chhattisgarh, india. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted among 12 and 15-year-old and urban and rural school going children in durg district. scientifically, based on the data obtained from the pilot study, sample size was calculated. a total of 1000 children were selected to be a part of the study and were interviewed face-to-face using a detailed pretested, close-ended questionnaire. the statistical package for the social sciences version 16.0 (spss pvt. ltd, chicago, il, usa) was used for the statistical analyses. results: prevalence of tobacco consumption was 48.8%. males were involved predominantly in consuming tobacco. the knowledge and attitude was better in the school children of urban areas than the school children of rural areas; more of the urban school children were involved in smoking cigarette. rural children outnumbered urban children in the smokeless tobacco consumption. conclusion: prevalence of tobacco consumption among school children remains high with a wide disparity among urban and rural children. there is an urgent need to have a rural orientation in the national tobacco control program that is currently being developed by the government of india and giving relevance to the youth. background: tobacco consumption is one of the major pre­ ventable causes of tobacco related cancer. in india, tobacco related cancer accounts for half the total cancer cases among males and 20% of the cancer cases among women. the preval­ ence of tobacco consumption among the tribal youths is high. aim: to know the prevalence and the pattern of tobacco con­ sumption among the adolescents of tribal areas. settings: five tribal villages under the primary health centre, waradh, in the district yavatmal, maharashtra state, india. design: a community based cross sectional study. methods and material: the study consisted of 502 adolescents of both the sexes. the data was collected on a predesigned proforma during the period from october 2009 to september 2010. after obtaining the consent of the subjects, the information which was related to their socio­demographic characteristics and tobacco consumption was collected. the statistical analysis was done by using the chi square test and percentage. results: overall, the prevalence of tobacco consumption among the adolescents of the tribal areas was 45.42%. 65.31% male and 26.46% female adolescents were habituated to it. all female, and majority of the male adolescents predominantly consumed a smokeless form of tobacco. most of them (89%) started chewing tobacco / gutkha between 5­15 years of age. the females had started consuming tobacco at younger ages than the males. social customs were the major influencing factor for the tobacco consumption, followed by peer pressure. the consumption of tobacco among the family members significantly (p<0.001) increased the tobacco use among the adolescents. conclusion: the prevalence of tobacco consumption was high in the tribal adolescents. social customs, peer pressure and the consumption of tobacco by the family members were the major contributing factors which emphasized the need of strengthening the information, education and communication (iec) activities.
several single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of the glutamate metabotrophic receptor 7 gene (grm7) have recently been identified by the genome-wide association study (gwas) as potentially playing a role in susceptibility to age-related hearing impairment (arhi), however this has not been validated in the han chinese population. the aim of this study was to determine if these snps are also associated with arhi in an elderly male han chinese population. in this case-control candidate genes association study, a total of 982 men with arhi and 324 normal-hearing controls subjects were studied. using k-means cluster analysis, four audiogram shape subtypes of arhi were identified in the case group: ‘‘flat shape (fl)’’, ‘‘sloping shape (sl)’’, ‘‘2-4 khz abrupt loss (al) shape’’ and ‘‘8 khz dip (8d) shape’’. results suggested that the snp rs11928865 (a>t) of grm7 was significantly associated with arhi after adjusting for non-genetic factors (p= 0.000472, or= 1.599, 95%ci= 1.229~2.081). furthermore, frequency of tt genotype (rs11928865) were significant higher in the sl subgroup and al subgroup with compared to controls group (p= 9.41e-05, or= 1.945, 95%ci= 1.393~2.715; p= 0.000109, or= 1.915, 95%ci= 1.378~2.661 adjusted, respectively) after bonferroni correction. however, there wasn’t significant difference in the frequency of the tt genotype between cases in the fl subgroup or the 8d subgroup with when compared with controls. results of the current study suggest that, in an elderly male han chinese population, grm7 snp rs11928865 (tt) occurs more frequently in arhi patients with sl and al phenotype patterns. the grainyhead‐like 2 gene (grhl2) was found to be associated with age‐related hearing impairment (arhi) in europeans. we tested whether the same association exists in the han chinese population.
the purpose of this study was to assess the clinical relevance, limitations and most common findings of axillary ultrasound and subsequent image-guided aspiration cytology in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients who are at high risk for axillary metastasis. following institutional review board approval and health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa) compliance, sonographic axillary surveys from 112 patients considered at high risk for axillary metastases were reviewed retrospectively for the following abnormal features: asymmetric cortical thickening/lobulations; loss or compression of the hyperechoic medullary region; absence of fatty hilum; abnormal lymph node shape; hypoechoic cortex; admixture of normal and abnormal appearing nodes; and increased peripheral blood flow. patients with either normal or abnormal ultrasound exams, but negative cytology, underwent sentinel node mapping. patients with abnormal ultrasound and positive cytology proceeded to complete axillary dissection. the number of positive nodes, the size of tumour deposits and the histological pattern of metastatic disease on the positive nodes were then correlated and compared with their corresponding sonographic abnormalities. abnormalities related to the lymph node cortex were indicative of n1a disease. features such as loss or compression of the hyperechoic medullary region, absence of fatty hilum, abnormal lymph node shape and increased peripheral blood flow were predictors of n2-3 disease. in conclusion, nodal sonographic characteristics of patients at high risk for metastases are useful predictors of tumour burden in the axilla. when combined with the results from aspiration cytology, these findings could modify the surgical approach to the axilla, eliminating the need for sentinel node mapping in a significant proportion of patients. backgroundsonographically directed fine-needle aspiration is a less invasive and less costly alternative to sentinel node (sn) mapping in breast cancer patients at high risk for metastatic disease but with clinically negative axillae.methodsradiographic, cytological, and histological diagnostic data on breast primary tumors from 114 consecutive sn candidates were prospectively assessed for clinicopathologic variables associated with an increased incidence of axillary metastases. patients in whom these variables were identified underwent sonographic examination of their axillae followed by fine-needle aspiration when abnormal nodes were detected. sn mapping was performed in patients with normal axillary sonogram results or negative cytological results. patients with positive cytological results proceeded to complete axillary dissection. final axillary histological outcomes from patients not meeting the high-risk criteria were recorded. additionally, a cost analysis was performed in which the costs of ultrasonography and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the axilla were compared with those of sn mapping.resultsaccording to our selection criteria, a third of the patients with clinically negative axillae (37 of 114; 32%) were considered at high risk for axillary metastases. fifty-nine percent of these patients (22 of 37) had metastatic disease on final histological analysis. forty percent (15 of 37) of high-risk patients were spared sn mapping, with a reduction in health care costs of 20% in this patient population. eighty-seven percent of patients not meeting high-risk criteria were sn negative.conclusionsthis study suggests that in patients at increased risk for axillary metastases, the use of sonographic evaluation of the axilla in combination with fine-needle aspiration is not only clinically justified, but also cost-effective.
the effects induced by exogenous manipulation of endocannabinoid neurotransmission on emotion and memory are often contradictory. among the different factors involved, of particular interest is the binding affinity of endocannabinoids, and their analogs, for other receptor families beyond cannabinoid receptors, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars), and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 1 (trpv1). the aim of this study was to investigate which receptor subtype mediates cannabinoid effects on memory consolidation for emotionally arousing experiences. we tested two cannabinoid compounds with different pharmacological properties in the inhibitory avoidance task, and evaluated whether the observed effects are mediated by cannabinoid, pparα or trpv1 receptor activation. we found that the synthetic cannabinoid agonist win55,212-2 and the faah inhibitor urb597 both enhanced memory consolidation for inhibitory avoidance training. win55,212-22 effects on memory consolidation were predominantly mediated by cb1 receptor activation but cb2 receptors were involved as well. the urb597-induced memory enhancement was dependent on the activation not only of cb1 and cb2 receptors but, notwithstanding, ppar-α and trpv1 receptors were involved as well. our findings drive beyond the classical hypothesis centered on the unique role of cb1 receptor activation for cannabinoid effects on memory, and reveal new insights in the neural mechanisms of memory consolidation. during the last eight years a number of bioactive lipid mediators, the amides or esters of long chain fatty acids, have been discovered or re-discovered. these are: anandamide (n-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine, aea) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-ag), two endogenous agonists of cannabinoid receptors; oleamide (cis-9-octadecenoamide), a putative endogenous sleep-inducing factor; n-palmitoylethanol amine (pea), a compound with promising anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activity. these compounds are all substrates for the same hydrolytic enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah), whose molecular characterization was obtained in 1996. the molecular and enzymatic properties, tissue distribution, substrate recognition properties, physiological regulation and biological role of faah are discussed in this article, with special emphasis on the possible pharmacological manipulation of the activity of this enzyme with therapeutic purpose.
objective the aim of this study was to assess the functional results of an early onset progressive eccentric and concentric training in patients with autogen hamstring anterior cruciate ligament (acl) reconstruction.   methods thirty-three patients with autogenous hamstring acl reconstruction were randomly divided into study (n=16, mean age; 33.87±8.19) and control (n=17, mean age; 32.64±8.21) groups and followed the same acl rehabilitation program. additionally, the study group followed a progressive eccentric and concentric training for 12 weeks on the monitorized functional squat system (mfss) beginning 3 weeks after surgery. the groups were compared according to the isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors, functional performance (the vertical jump test, a single hop for distance test) and the lysholm knee scale, the anterior cruciate ligament-quality of life questionnaire (acl-qol), before and 16 weeks after the surgery.   results the functional outcomes in terms of the vertical jump test (p=0.012), a single hop-for-distance test (p=0.027), the lysholm knee scale (p=0.002) and the acl-qol questionnaire (p=0.000) demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the study group. no significant difference was reported between groups for isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors (p>0.05).   conclusion adding progressive eccentric and concentric exercises to the standard rehabilitation protocol may improve the functional results after acl reconstruction with autogen hamstring grafts. we report isokinetic results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon or hamstring graft from the literature analysis. the literature was defined from two search "textwords": isokinetic and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and from three databases: medline, pascal, and herasmus. two independent physicians (physical medicine and rehabilitation) carried out an analysis according to the french national accreditation and health evaluation agency recommendations. fifty-three studies were selected: 29 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft, 15 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring graft, and 9 studies compared the two surgical procedures. after discussing different bias and in reference to prospective randomised and comparative studies, the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft involves a knee extensors deficit during several months. the hamstring surgical procedure involves a less important knee extensor deficit (from 6 to 19 % against 8 to 21 %). knee sprain and intra-articular surgery involve a long-lasting knee extensors deficit. anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings graft involves a knee flexors deficit over several months. the patellar tendon surgical procedure involves a less important knee flexors deficit (from 1 to 15 % against 5 to 17 %). in reference to isokinetic parameters, no difference between the two surgical procedures (patellar tendon graft or hamstring graft) is shown after more than twenty-four post-surgical months.
prostate tumor overexpressed 1 was recently identified as a novel gene and protein during a differential display screening for genes overexpressed in prostate cancer. it has been suggested that overexpression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 can contribute to the proliferative status of prostate tumor cells and, thus, to their biologic behavior. prostate tumor overexpressed 1 and ki-67 were immunohistochemically evaluated in prostate cancer, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal-looking epithelium in 20 cystoprostatectomies and 20 radical prostatectomies with pt2a gleason score 6 prostate cancer. the aim was to see whether there were differences in marker expression between cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies. the proportions of prostate tumor overexpressed 1- and ki-67-positive cells in the cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies increased from normal-looking epithelium through high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, away from and adjacent to prostate cancer, to prostate cancer. prostate tumor overexpressed 1 expression in prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomies was lower than in radical prostatectomies, the differences being significant; there were significant differences in ki-67 indices. in conclusion, our findings related to prostate tumor overexpressed 1 expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, evaluated adjacent and away from prostate cancer, and in incidental and clinical cancers give further support to the concept of field effect in prostatic carcinogenesis as well as to differences in the process of prostatic carcinogenesis between cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies. diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is usually not difficult in biopsy specimens. problems may occur in biopsy specimens, containing only a few suspicious lesions. recently, p504s has been tested as a new marker for prostatic carcinoma. when over-expressed in atypical glands without basal cells, it establishes the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma. we analysed the staining intensity of p504s in 208 biopsy specimens from prostates (1) with adenocarcinoma (n=132), (2) with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (hgpin) with adenocarcinoma (n=36), (3) with hgpin alone (n=40) and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to (n=54) or distant from adenocarcinoma (n=64). p504s expression was negative to weakly positive in biopsy specimens showing hgpin without carcinoma and weakly positive in radical prostatectomy specimens revealing hgpin distant from adenocarcinoma. in biopsy specimens with a combination of hgpin and adenocarcinoma and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to adenocarcinoma, p504s was strongly expressed. the same findings were made in radical prostatectomy specimens containing adenocarcinoma and hgpin adjacent to or distant from adenocarcinoma and in preoperative biopsies revealing adenocarcinoma and hgpin. these results suggest that moderate to strong p504s expression in hgpin of biopsy specimens is indicative of an associated adenocarcinoma and may be helpful in the choice of therapy.
this study sought to determine the effect of the pre-transition work rate (wr) and wr transition magnitude on the adjustment of pulmonary oxygen uptake (vo2p kinetics) in older men. seven men (69 ± 5 years; mean ± sd) each performed 4–6 cycling transitions from 20 w to either a wr corresponding to 90% estimated lactate threshold (full step, fs) or 2 equal-step transitions (lower step, ls; upper step, us) to the same end-exercise wr as in fs. gas exchange was analysed breath-by-breath and muscle deoxygenation (∆[hhb]) was measured with nirs. the time constant (τ) for vo2p was greater in us (53 ± 17 s) and fs (44 ± 11 s) compared to ls (37 ± 9 s); τvo2p for us also trended (p = 0.05) towards being greater than fs. the vo2p gain in us (9.97 ± 0.41 ml/min/w) was greater than ls (9.06 ± 1.17; p = 0.06) and fs (9.13 ± 0.54; p < 0.05). the o2 deficit was greater in us (0.25 ± 0.08 l) than ls (0.19 ± 0.06 l); yet the ‘accumulated o2 deficit’ (0.44 ± 0.13 l; o2 deficit from ls + us) was similar to that of fs (0.42 ± 0.13 l; p = 0.38). the effective δ[hhb] response time (τ′∆[hhb]) for us (36 ± 12 s) was greater than ls (27 ± 6 s; p = 0.07) and fs (26 ± 4 s; p < 0.05), suggesting that the slowed adjustment of muscle o2 extraction was associated with the slowed vo2 kinetics of the us. despite already slowed vo2p kinetics, older men exhibit further slowing when small wr transitions are initiated from an elevated pre-transition wr, yet this results in no cumulative impact on o2 deficit. this slowing in us compared to ls does not appear to be related to local o2 availability. abstract. pulmonary oxygen uptake (% mathtype!mtef!2!1!+- % feaaeaart1ev0aqatcvaufkttlearuavp1wzzbqedmvetj2bsbwexl % mbbxgbcf2cpn2qvrwzqf2zlnharywqvvncpvmcg4uz3bqee0evguee % 0jxyaibaieylf9irveeu0dxdh9vqqj-heeeu0xxdbba9frfj0-oqff % ea0dxdd9vqaq-jfrvkfhe9pgea0dxdar-jb9hs0dxdbpyxe9vr0-vr % 0-vqpwqaaeaabigaciaacaqabeaadaqaaqaaaoqaaiqbdafawzaaca % gaee4ta80aasbaasqaaiabbkdayaqabaaaaa!386a!$\dot v{\rm o}_{\rm 2} $ ) dynamics during moderate-intensity exercise are often assumed to be dynamically linear (i.e. neither the gain nor the time constant (τ) of the response varies as a function of work rate). however, faster, slower and unchanged % mathtype!mtef!2!1!+- % feaaeaart1ev0aqatcvaufkttlearuavp1wzzbqedmvetj2bsbwexl % mbbxgbcf2cpn2qvrwzqf2zlnharywqvvncpvmcg4uz3bqee0evguee % 0jxyaibaieylf9irveeu0dxdh9vqqj-heeeu0xxdbba9frfj0-oqff % ea0dxdd9vqaq-jfrvkfhe9pgea0dxdar-jb9hs0dxdbpyxe9vr0-vr % 0-vqpwqaaeaabigaciaacaqabeaadaqaaqaaaoqaaiqbdafawzaaca % gaee4ta80aasbaasqaaiabbkdayaqabaaaaa!386a!$\dot v{\rm o}_{\rm 2} $  kinetics have been reported during work-to-work transitions compared to rest-to-work transitions, all within the moderate-intensity domain. in an attempt to resolve these discrepancies and to improve the confidence of the parameter estimation, we determined the % mathtype!mtef!2!1!+- % feaaeaart1ev0aqatcvaufkttlearuavp1wzzbqedmvetj2bsbwexl % mbbxgbcf2cpn2qvrwzqf2zlnharywqvvncpvmcg4uz3bqee0evguee % 0jxyaibaieylf9irveeu0dxdh9vqqj-heeeu0xxdbba9frfj0-oqff % ea0dxdd9vqaq-jfrvkfhe9pgea0dxdar-jb9hs0dxdbpyxe9vr0-vr % 0-vqpwqaaeaabigaciaacaqabeaadaqaaqaaaoqaaiqbdafawzaaca % gaee4ta80aasbaasqaaiabbkdayaqabaaaaa!386a!$\dot v{\rm o}_{\rm 2} $  response dynamics using the averaged response to repeated exercise bouts in seven healthy male volunteers. each subject initially performed a ramp-incremental exercise test for the estimation of the lactate threshold (% mathtype!mtef!2!1!+- % feaaeaart1ev0aqatcvaufkttlearuavp1wzzbqedmvetj2bsbwexl % mbbxgbcf2cpn2qvrwzqf2zlnharywqvvncpvmcg4uz3bqee0evguee % 0jxyaibaieylf9irveeu0dxdh9vqqj-heeeu0xxdbba9frfj0-oqff % ea0dxdd9vqaq-jfrvkfhe9pgea0dxdar-jb9hs0dxdbpyxe9vr0-vr % 0-vqpwqaaeaabigaciaacaqabeaadaqaaqaaaoqaaiqbei7axzaaja % waasbaasqaaiabbyeambqabaaaaa!3801!$\hat \theta _{\rm l} $ ). they then performed an average of four repetitions of each of three constant-work-rate (wr) tests: (1) between 20 w and a work rate of 50% (wr50) between 20 w and 90% % mathtype!mtef!2!1!+- % feaaeaart1ev0aqatcvaufkttlearuavp1wzzbqedmvetj2bsbwexl % mbbxgbcf2cpn2qvrwzqf2zlnharywqvvncpvmcg4uz3bqee0evguee % 0jxyaibaieylf9irveeu0dxdh9vqqj-heeeu0xxdbba9frfj0-oqff % ea0dxdd9vqaq-jfrvkfhe9pgea0dxdar-jb9hs0dxdbpyxe9vr0-vr % 0-vqpwqaaeaabigaciaacaqabeaadaqaaqaaaoqaaiqbei7axzaaja % waasbaasqaaiabbyeambqabaaaaa!3801!$\hat \theta _{\rm l} $  (step 1→2), (2) between wr50 and 90% % mathtype!mtef!2!1!+- % feaaeaart1ev0aqatcvaufkttlearuavp1wzzbqedmvetj2bsbwexl % mbbxgbcf2cpn2qvrwzqf2zlnharywqvvncpvmcg4uz3bqee0evguee % 0jxyaibaieylf9irveeu0dxdh9vqqj-heeeu0xxdbba9frfj0-oqff % ea0dxdd9vqaq-jfrvkfhe9pgea0dxdar-jb9hs0dxdbpyxe9vr0-vr % 0-vqpwqaaeaabigaciaacaqabeaadaqaaqaaaoqaaiqbei7axzaaja % waasbaasqaaiabbyeambqabaaaaa!3801!$\hat \theta _{\rm l} $  (step 2→3), and (3) between 20 w and 90% % mathtype!mtef!2!1!+- % feaaeaart1ev0aqatcvaufkttlearuavp1wzzbqedmvetj2bsbwexl % mbbxgbcf2cpn2qvrwzqf2zlnharywqvvncpvmcg4uz3bqee0evguee % 0jxyaibaieylf9irveeu0dxdh9vqqj-heeeu0xxdbba9frfj0-oqff % ea0dxdd9vqaq-jfrvkfhe9pgea0dxdar-jb9hs0dxdbpyxe9vr0-vr % 0-vqpwqaaeaabigaciaacaqabeaadaqaaqaaaoqaaiqbei7axzaaja % waasbaasqaaiabbyeambqabaaaaa!3801!$\hat \theta _{\rm l} $  (step 1→3);

abstract pecam-1/cd31 is known to regulate inflammatory responses and exhibit pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. this study was designed to determine the functional role of pecam-1 in susceptibility to murine primary in vivo infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and in in vitro inflammatory responses of peritoneal macrophages. lectin profiling showed that cellular pecam-1 and recombinant human pecam-1-ig chimera contain high levels of mannose sugars and n-acetylglucosamine. consistent with this carbohydrate pattern, both recombinant human and murine pecam-1-ig chimeras were shown to bind s. typhimurium in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. using oral and fecal-oral transmission models of s. typhimurium sl1344 infection, pecam-1−/− mice were found to be more resistant to s. typhimurium infection than wild-type (wt) c57bl/6 mice. while fecal shedding of s. typhimurium was comparable in wild-type and pecam-1−/− mice, the pecam-1-deficient mice had lower bacterial loads in systemic organs such as liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes than wt mice, suggesting that extraintestinal dissemination was reduced in the absence of pecam-1. this reduced bacterial load correlated with reduced tumor necrosis factor (tnf), interleukin-6 (il-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (mcp) levels in sera of pecam-1−/− mice. following in vitro stimulation of macrophages with either whole s. typhimurium, lipopolysaccharide (lps) (toll-like receptor 4 [tlr4] ligand), or poly(i·c) (tlr3 ligand), production of tnf and il-6 by pecam-1−/− macrophages was reduced. together, these results suggest that pecam-1 may have multiple functions in resistance to infection with s. typhimurium, including binding to host cells, extraintestinal spread to deeper tissues, and regulation of inflammatory cytokine production by infected macrophages. in the human gut mucosa, specialized m cells deliver intact foreign macromolecules and commensal bacteria from the lumen to organized mucosal lymphoid tissues triggering immune responses. m cells are also major sites of adhesion and invasion for enteric pathogens. the molecular features of m cell apical surfaces that promote microbial normal attachment are still largely unknown. we have demonstrated previously that in the human colonic epithelium, carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) and cea-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (ceacam1) are integral components of the apical glycocalyx which participate in epithelial–microbial interactions. in this study, based on the reactivity of specific monoclonal antibodies and on immunoelectron microscopy, we show that m cells of human colonic solitary lymphoid follicles express cea and ceacam1 on the apical surface. recently these highly glycosylated molecules have been characterized as protein receptors for different bacteria. this leads us to propose a role for cea and ceacam1 in the adherence of enteric bacteria to the apical membrane of colonic m cells. we also hypothesize that, unlike colonic enterocytes, m cells lack the defense mechanism that eliminates cea and ceacam1 upon microbial binding and which is based on vesiculation of microvillus plasma membrane.
hairy root cultures of echinacea, one of the most important medicinal plants in the us, represent a valuable alternative to field cultivation for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. in this study, the three most economically important species of echinacea (echinacea purpurea, echinacea pallida, and echinacea angustifolia) were readily transformed with two strains of agrobacterium that produce the hairy root phenotype. transformed roots of all three species exhibited consistent accelerated growth and increased levels of alkamide production. optimization of the culture of echinacea hairy roots was implemented to enhance both growth and alkamide production concomitantly. the use of half-strength gamborg’s b5 medium supplemented with 3.0% sucrose was twice as effective in maintaining hairy root production than any other media tested. the addition of indolebutyric acid increased the growth rate of roots by as much as 14-fold. alkamide production increased severalfold in response to the addition of the elicitor, jasmonic acid, but did not respond to the addition of indolebutyric acid. induced accumulation of the important bioactive compounds, alkamides 2 and 8, was observed both in transformed roots and in response to jasmonic acid treatments. the results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of hairy root cultures of echinacea for the in vitro production of alkamides and establish guidelines for optimum yield. efficient plant regeneration was achieved via organogenesis from callus cultures derived from leaf tissue of echinacea purpurea. proliferating shoot cultures were obtained by placing leaf explants on murashige and skoog (ms) medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine (bap) and naphthaleneacetic acid (naa) combinations. ms medium supplemented with bap (4.44 μm) and naa (0.054 μm) was the most effective, providing high shoot regeneration frequencies (100%) associated with a high number of shoots per explant (7.7 shoots/explant). plantlets were rooted on ms medium alone or in combination with different concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (iba), and high rooting and survival was achieved using ms media without plant growth regulators (pgr). all plantlets survived acclimatization producing healthy plants in the greenhouse. this study demonstrated that adventitious shoot regeneration of e. purpurea from leaf explants can be a useful method for the multiplication of this important medicinal plant.
osteoporosis is one of the major complications of glucocorticoid (gc) therapy. few data are available on the usefulness of quantitative ultrasound (qus), a technique that could also theoretically provide information on bone structure, in the management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (gio). this study aimed (1) to evaluate the ability of qus in detecting bone impairment and in being associated with the prevalence of fragility fracture in gc patients; and (2) to assess whether qus parameters, and particularly the graphic trace analysis of qus signal at phalanges, show any peculiar pattern of gio. we studied 192 patients (136 women and 56 men, mean age 56.7 ± 14.2 years) on treatment with gcs for at least 6 months, and 192 sex- and age-matched controls. in all subjects, we measured bone mineral density (bmd) at lumbar spine and at femur by dxa, and ultrasound parameters at calcaneus and phalanges. all dxa and qus parameters were significantly lower in gc patients than in controls and in fracture than in nonfracture gc patients. bmd at lumbar spine showed the best ability in discriminating gc patients with or without fractures. among qus parameters, stiffness showed a discriminatory ability significantly better than ad-sos. bmd at lumbar spine and total femur, stiffness, and ad-sos are able to predict the odds of fragility fracture event. qus parameters of the postmenopausal gc patients (n=105) and of the postmenopausal healthy controls (n=101) were also compared with those obtained in a separate sample of 90 postmenopausal osteoporotic women (pmo). all parameters were significantly lower in gc patients and in pmo than in controls, without any significant difference between gc and pmo. our findings show that qus can be useful in the assessment of glucocorticoid-induced bone impairment. in addition, in this study we found no alteration in qus parameters or in the graphic trace analysis which could differentiate between gio and pmo. further longitudinal studies are needed to define the role of qus in the prediction of fracture risk and in the clinical management of gio. objective with increasing life span osteoporosis becomes a more recognized problem in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). the aim of this cross-sectional study in 75 adult patients with cf (mean age 25.3 years) was to assess the prevalence of low bone mineral density (bmd) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) and, for the first time, by quantitative ultrasound (qus), and to identify predicting factors.   design and methods bone status was assessed at the lumbar spine (l2-l4) and the femoral neck by dexa, and at the calcaneus by qus (stiffness index). these data were correlated with a variety of clinical and anthropomorphic variables. biochemical markers of bone turnover such as osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, crosslinks in urine, 25-hydroxy vitamin d (25-oh vitamin d), parathyroid hormone, calcium and free testosterone were determined by standard assays.   results the mean bmd t score (+/-s.e.m.) was -1.4+/-0.17 at the lumbar spine, and -0.54+/-0.16 at the femoral neck. the mean t score of the calcaneal stiffness index was -0.83+/-0.19. based on a lumbar spine t score <-2.5 by dexa, 27% of the patients had osteoporosis. multiple regression analysis showed that the forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) and the use of oral glucocorticoids were independent predictors of low lumbar spine bmd, whereas body mass index (bmi) and the use of oral glucocorticoids were independent predictors of low femoral neck bmd. the stiffness index correlated moderately with bmd (0.49-0.62, p<0.0001). qus had a sensitivity and specificity of only 57% and 89% respectively for diagnosing 'osteoporosis' (based on a femoral neck t score <-2.5 by dexa). positive and negative predictive values were 36% and 95% respectively.   conclusions low bmd is frequent in adults with cf and is most strongly correlated with disease severity (bmi, fev1) and the use of glucocorticoids. calcaneal qus might help to screen out patients with a normal bmd, but sensitivity and specificity were not sufficiently high to replace dexa in these patients.
hmgi-c and hmgi(y) are architectural dna-binding proteins that participate in the conformational regulation of active chromatin. their pattern of expression in embryonal and adult tissues, the analysis of the "pygmy" phenotype induced by the inactivation of the hmgi-c gene, and their frequent qualitative or quantitative alteration in experimental and human tumors indicate their pivotal role in the control of cell growth, differentiation, and tumorigenesis in several tissues representative of the epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic lineages. in contrast, very little information is available on their expression and function in neural cells. here, we investigated the expression of the hmgi(y) and hmgi-c genes in neuroblastoma (nb), a tumor arising from an alteration of the normal differentiation of neural crest-derived cells and in embryonal and adult adrenal tissue. although hmgi(y) is constitutively expressed in the embryonal and adult adrenal gland and in all of the nb cell lines and ex vivo tumors examined, its regulation appears to be associated to growth inhibition and differentiation because we observed that hmgi(y) expression is reduced by retinoic acid (ra) in several nb cell lines that are induced to differentiate into postmitotic neurons, whereas it is up-regulated by ra in cells that fail to differentiate. furthermore, the decrease of hmgi(y) expression observed in ra-induced growth arrest and differentiation is abrogated in cells that have been made insensitive to this drug by nmyc overexpression. in contrast, hmgi-c expression is down-regulated during the development of the adrenal gland, completely absent in the adult individual, and only detectable in a subset of ex vivo nb tumors and in ra-resistant nb cell lines. we provide evidence of a causal link between hmgi-c expression and resistance to the growth arrest induced by ra in nb cell lines because exogenous hmgi-c expression in hmgi-c-negative and ra-sensitive cells is sufficient to convert them into ra-resistant cells. therefore, we suggest that hmgi-c and hmgi(y) may participate in growth- and differentiation-related tumor progression events of neuroectodermal derivatives. retinoic acid (ra) induces the neuronal differentiation of many human neuroblastoma cell lines. in this study, we show that ra treatment of neuroblastoma cells induces the expression of trkb, the receptor for the neurotrophins bdnf, nt-3, and nt-4/5. bdnf addition to ra-treated sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of trkb and neuronal differentiation. ra treatment of kcnr neuroblastoma cells, which constitutively express bdnf mrna, resulted in the expression of trkb and differentiation in the absence of added bdnf. finally, in 15n neuroblastoma cells, which express bdnf mrna but do not differentiate in response to ra, ra induced only a truncated form of trkb. 15n cells transfected with full-length trkb differentiated in the absence of ra. these results indicate that ra induces the neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells by modulating the expression of neurotrophin receptors.
we combine multiple word representations based on semantic clusters extracted from the (brown et al., 1992) algorithm and syntactic clusters obtained from the berkeley parser (petrov et al., 2006) in order to improve discriminative dependency parsing in the mst-parser framework (mcdonald et al., 2005). we also provide an ensemble method for combining diverse cluster-based models. the two contributions together significantly improves unlabeled dependency accuracy from 90.82% to 92.13%. we present an effective training algorithm for linearly-scored dependency parsers that implements online large-margin multi-class training (crammer and singer, 2003; crammer et al., 2003) on top of efficient parsing techniques for dependency trees (eisner, 1996). the trained parsers achieve a competitive dependency accuracy for both english and czech with no language specific enhancements.
phytoene synthase (psy), which is encoded by the phytoene synthase 1 (psy1) gene, is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the plant carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. in order to examine the genetic diversity and evolution pattern of psy1 within the andropogoneae, sequences of 76 accessions from 5 species (maize, teosinte, tripsacum, coix, and sorghum) of the andropogoneae were tested, along with 4 accessions of rice (oryza sativa l.) included as outliers. both the number and the order of exons and introns were relatively conserved across the species tested. three domains were identified in the coding sequence, including signal peptide (sp), psy, and highly conserved squalene synthase (sqs) domain. although no positive selection signal was detected at an overall coding level among all species tested, the sp domain and the region upstream of the sqs–psy domain appear to have undergone rapid evolution, as evidenced by a high dn/ds ratio (>1.0). at the nucleotide level, positive selection and balancing selection were detected only among the yellow maize germplasm and the white maize germplasm, respectively. the phylogenetic tree based on full-length sequences of psy1-like regions supported the monophyletic theory of the andropogoneae and the closest relationship between zea and tripsacum among the andropogoneae. coix, which was theorized to have a closer relationship with maize due to similarities in morphology and chromosome number, has been shown in this study to have diverged relatively early from the other andropogoneae, including maize. several authors have proposed that changes in a small number of regulatory genes may be sufficient for the evolution of novel morphologies. recent analyses have indicated that teosinte branched1 (tb1), a putative bhlh transcription factor, played such a role during the morphological evolution of maize from its wild ancestor, teosinte. to address whether or not tb1 played a similar role during the evolution of the andropogoneae, the tribe to which maize belongs, and to examine the rate and pattern of tb1 evolution within this tribe, we analyzed tb1-like sequences from 23 members of the andropogoneae and five other grasses. our analysis revealed that the tb1 protein evolves slowly within three conserved domains but rapidly outside these domains. the nonconserved regions of the gene are characterized by both a high nonsynonymous substitution rate and frequent indels. the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (d(n)) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (d(s)) was not significantly greater than 1.0, providing no evidence for positive selection. however, the d(n)/d(s) ratio varied significantly among lineages and was high compared with those of other plant nuclear genes. variation in the d(n)/d(s) ratio among the andropogoneae could be explained by unequal levels of purifying selection among lineages. consistent with this interpretation, the rate of nonsynonymous substitution differed along several lineages, while the synonymous substitution rate did not differ significantly. finally, using tb1, we examined phylogenetic relationships within the andropogoneae. the phylogeny suggests that the tribe underwent a rapid radiation during its early history and that the monoecious andropogoneae are polyphyletic.
acute phase proteins (apps) and immune responses in pigs after experimental infection with h1n2 swine influenza virus (swh1n2) were studied. eight piglets were infected intranasally with swh1n2. four served as controls. antibodies against swine influenza virus (siv)s were measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay. the proliferation assay was used to measure influenza-specific cell-mediated response. hematological parameters were measured on a hematology analyzer. c-reactive protein (crp), haptoglobin (hp), serum amyloid a (saa) and pig major app (pig-map) concentrations in serum were measured using commercial elisas. antibodies against swh1n2 in the serum of infected pigs were detected from 7 dpi. swh1n2-specific t-cell response was observed from 5 dpi. a significant drop in lymphocyte numbers and an increase in medium-sized cell (mid) counts with no accompanying leukopenia was observed in all infected pigs from 3 to 7 dpi. in infected pigs, concentrations of crp, hp and saa increased significantly when the greatest amounts of virus were shed (from 1 to 3 dpi). the level of pig-map remained unchanged during study. the significant positive correlation found between maximum concentrations of saa in serum and lung scores, makes saa a potentially useful indicator in experimental infection studies (e.g. vaccine efficiency investigations) or as a marker for disease severity, but to confirm this hypothesis more studies are needed. in the present study, acute phase proteins (app) responses in pigs after infection with toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida (pm) were evaluated. twelve piglets from a herd free from toxigenic pm were used. six of them were infected intranasally with pm. crp, hp, saa and pig-map concentrations were measured using commercial elisa tests. crp and hp were significantly induced from 2 days post inoculation (dpi). the concentration of hp in inoculated pigs remained elevated until the end of the study. the concentrations of saa and pig-map increased significantly from 3 dpi, and remained elevated to 5 or 7 dpi, respectively. strong correlations were observed between concentration of hp or saa and changes in the lungs. no correlations were found between levels of app in serum and changes observed in the turbinates. on the basis of our investigation, we cannot state that evaluation of app concentrations in serum may provide useful information about severity of atrophic rhinitis. however, the concentration of all investigated app increased after inoculation. thus, app-measurements may reveal ongoing infection. monitoring of app concentrations in the pig herds may help to pinpoint infected animals even before clinical signs are present. if found, these "app-high" animals may be chosen next for pathogen-specific diagnostics. early diagnosis and therapy may prevent the infection from spreading in the herd. moreover, monitoring of app concentrations in serum may be useful for selecting clinically healthy pigs before integration into an uninfected herd. future studies should focus on the possibility of distinguishing infected and non-infected pigs under field conditions.
abstract the purpose of this study was to verify the effects of 16 weeks of practicing different exercise programmes on body composition. this is an exploratory and descriptive study of 89 women aged 25 to 55 years (41.42 ± 9.23 years). the subjects were randomly divided into three experimental groups (eg): practitioners of strength training (sg), dance (dg), hydrogymnastics (hg), and a control group (cg) with sedentary women. measurements of body mass and height, circumferences of the chest, waist, abdomen, hips, thighs, calves, and skinfolds of the triceps, suprailiac and thigh were registered in three different moments: prior to the commencement of the training program, again after 8 weeks of training, and finally after 16 weeks of training. body density was estimated by using the trifold protocol by jackson, pollock and ward. the anova and deltas of change (δ%) were used for data analysis. the level of significance was set at p<0.05. the effects of greater statistical significance on body composition related the variables "time", "group" and the interaction between the two (time x group) were observed for the percentage of fat - f% (f (1.79, 152.52) = 24.59, p <0.001, η 2 = 0.22), fat mass - fm (f (1.75, 149.01) = 12.65, p <0.001, η 2 = 0.13) and lean mass - lm (f (1.77, 150.66) = 47.38, p <0.001, η 2 = 0.36). the hg and sg were more beneficial in reducing f%. it was observed that the eg indicated healthier anthropometric aspects compared to the cg, regardless of the type of exercise programmes practiced. the time factor was more representative over the effects of exercise on anthropometric dimensions. objective:the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 12-month moderate-to-vigorous exercise program combining aerobic and muscle strength training on body composition among sedentary, postmenopausal women. methods:a randomized controlled trial was conducted. a total of 189 sedentary postmenopausal women (age 50-69 y, body mass index 22-40 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to an exercise (n = 96) or a control group (n = 93). study parameters measured at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months were as follows: body weight and body height (body mass index), waist and hip circumference (body fat distribution), and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (total body fat and lean mass). differences in changes in study parameters between exercise and control group were examined with generalized estimating equations analysis. results:the exercise program did not result in significant effects on weight, body mass index, and hip circumference. the exercise group experienced a statistically significant greater loss in total body fat, both absolute (−0.33 kg) (borderline) as in a percentage (−0.43%) compared with the control group. in addition, lean mass increased significantly (+0.31 kg), whereas waist circumference (−0.57 cm) decreased significantly compared with the control group. conclusions:we conclude that a 12-month exercise program combining aerobic and muscle strength training did not affect weight but positively influenced body composition of postmenopausal women. affecting body fat distribution and waist circumference may have important health implications because it is an independent risk factor in obese but also in nonobese people. therefore, this study gives further credence to efforts of public health and general practitioners aiming to increase physical activity levels of postmenopausal women.
this study investigates how secondhand smoke (shs) exposure influences neonatal birth weight in jordan, a country with high smoking prevalence. the findings revealed that as the average number of shs exposure hours per week increased in the second trimester, the neonatal birth weight decreased while holding all covariates constant. women who reported a higher average number of shs exposure hours per week from work in the second trimester, home in the third trimester, and outside in the third trimester were at greater risk for having a low birth weight neonate than women who reported a lower average number of shs exposure hours. we analysed the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy on fetal growth parameters in 129 term newborns. children were classified into four depending on exposure on the basis of a questionnaire completed by the mother. the results confirmed that tobacco smoking reduced weight, length, cranial and thoracic perimeters at birth when exposure was due to either active or passive smoking. weight deficits of infants whose mothers smoked heavily (458 g) were higher than those whose mothers were exposed to passive smoking (192 g). we conclude that passive smoking is a very important variable and should be taken into account in any study of neonatal growth parameters.
this article aims to illustrate the function of the spleen in traditional chinese medicine (tcm) in the context of modern medicine. tcm has been practiced since ancient times in china for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases. yet, the complete understanding of its theoretical basis in relation to clinical practice from the modern medicine perspective is still lacking. according to tcm theory, the spleen, as one of the five zang (i.e., visceral organs), plays an important role in various physiological functions, including digestion and absorption of nutrients, regulation of water retention and excretion, facilitation of blood perfusion to skeletal muscle and on the optimal functioning of the immune system. clinical applications of herbal formulations for the treatment of spleen dysfunction (i.e., spleen deficiency—a decline in spleen function) and their pharmacological activities are described. the view point of tcm on how emotions (or qing zhi) can influence the body function is introduced. the relationship between anxiety and spleen function has been analyzed by reviewing relevant research studies in modern medicine. these findings suggest that the cause/consequence relationship between anxiety and spleen function may be bi-directional. some types of mood disorders and drugs are suggested to affect peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors (pbr), but their mechanisms are unclear. the isolation of pure lymphocytes is requisite for the investigation of the function of pbr on lymphocytes, since platelets and monocytes also have many pbr. the objective of this study was to establish a method of binding assay for pbr using pure t lymphocytes. mononuclear cells and t lymphocytes were prepared by using a density gradient material and magnetic beads, respectively. the cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and a counting chamber. binding studies were performed using t lymphocytes from 10 normal volunteers. the t lymphocytes were incubated with [3h]pk11195, harvested on glass fiber filters, and counted with a plate scintillation counter. the binding data were analyzed by the scatchard method. with the magnetic bead technique, pure t cells were selected that contained only 1.5% monocytes and platelet/cell ratio of 1.4. the scatchard plot of the data indicated that only one type of specific binding site was involved in the binding. the dissociation constant (kd) was 3.8+/-1.3nm (mean+/-sd), and the bmax was 379+/-124 fmol//10(6) cells (mean+/-sd). the density gradient- magnetic beads technique can be used as an appropriate method of preparation of t cells for pbr binding assay.
backgroundimmunological markers (cd4 count) are used in developing countries to decide on initiation of antiretroviral therapy and monitor hiv/aids disease progression. hiv is an incurable chronic illness, making quality of life paramount. the direct relationship between quality of life and cd4 count is unclear. the purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between change in cd4 count and quality of life measures in a ugandan cohort of people living with hiv.methodswe prospectively assessed quality of life among 1274 hiv patients attending an hiv clinic within a national referral hospital over a period of 6 months. quality of life was measured using an objective measure, the medical outcomes study hiv health survey summarized as physical health score and mental health score and a subjective measure, the global person generated index. generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the data. the primary predictor variable was change in cd4 count, and the outcome was quality of life scores. we controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, clinical factors and behavioral factors. twenty in-depth interviews were conducted to assess patient perception of quality of life and factors influencing quality of life.resultsof the 1274 patients enrolled 1159 had cd4 count at baseline and six months and 586 (51 %) received antiretroviral therapy. there was no association found between change in cd4 count and quality of life scores at univariate and multivariate analysis among the study participants whether on or not on antiretroviral therapy. participants perceived quality of life as happiness and well-being, influenced by economic status, psychosocial factors, and health status.conclusionsclinicians and policy makers cannot rely on change in immunological markers to predict quality of life in this era of initiating antiretroviral therapy among relatively healthy patients. in addition to monitoring immunological markers, socioeconomic and psychosocial factors should be underscored in management of hiv patients. this study compared the level of cd4 count, viral load and health-related quality of life (hrqol) between treatment-naïve aids patients and a cohort of people living with hiv who have been on treatment for 12 months. this study is based on a secondary data analysis of the records of 642 people with hiv consisting of 311 treatment-naïve aids patients and 331 people with hiv who have been on treatment for 12 months. the study findings are mostly presented in tables and analysed using the t-test to compare hrqol scores, cd4 count and viral load in the two groups. the study generally noted poor financial capacity and low activity tolerance among the participants. significant changes were noted in all the domains of hrqol compared between the treatment-naïve patients and the 12 months treatment cohort. in the same manner, the median cd4 cell count and viral load differed significantly between both groups. the treatment-naïve and the 12 months treatment cohorts consistently reported much lower quality of life scores in the level of dependence domain which includes the measures of mobility, activity of daily living, dependence on medication and work capacity. there were little or no associations between the biomedical markers (cd4 count and viral load) and hrqol indicators. however, the quality of life tended to increase with increase in the cd4 cell count. the poor to no association between the biomedical markers and hrqol indicators show that these cannot be direct proxies of each other and that the cd4 cell count and viral load alone may be inadequate eligibility criteria for social support.
background animal lines such as alcohol-preferring (p) and nonpreferring (np) rats appear to be suitable animal models to investigate the biological basis of alcohol-drinking behaviors. the extended amygdala serves as a neuroanatomical substrate for alcohol-drinking behaviors. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) in the amygdala has been implicated in alcohol-drinking behaviors; however, its expression in the extended amygdala of p and np rats is unknown. therefore, we examined the basal expression of bdnf in the extended amygdala of alcohol naive p and np rats.   methods we determined the basal mrna and protein levels of bdnf by in situ rt-pcr and immuno-histochemical procedure, respectively, in the amygdaloid [central nucleus of amygdala (cea), medial nucleus of amygdala (mea), and basolateral amygdala (bla)], nucleus accumbal (nac shell and core), and bed nucleus of stria terminalis (bnst) [lateral bnst (lbnst), medial bnst (mbnst), and ventral bnst (vbnst)] brain structures of p and np rats. in addition, we examined the localization of bdnf in neurons using double-immunofluorescence labeling of bdnf with neuron-specific nuclear protein (neun) and also determined the number of neun-positive neurons in the amygdaloid structures of p and np rats.   results the mrna and protein levels of bdnf were found to be significantly lower in both the cea and mea, but not in the bla, of p compared with np rats. we also found that bdnf was expressed in neurons in the amygdaloid structures of p and np rats. in addition, we found that the number of neun-positive neurons was similar in the amygdaloid structures of p and np rats. interestingly, the mrna and protein levels of bdnf were also significantly lower in the lbnst, mbnst, and vbnst of p compared with np rats. on the other hand, mrna and protein levels of bdnf were similar in the nac shell and core structures of p and np rats.   conclusions p and np rats are selectively bred for higher and lower alcohol preference, respectively; therefore it is possible that lower bdnf levels in the amygdaloid and bnst structures may be associated with the excessive alcohol-drinking behaviors of p rats. abstract: the neuropeptide‐inducing activity of neurotrophic factors was tested in cultured cerebral cortical neurons. brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) specifically increased contents of the neuropeptides somatostatin (som) and neuropeptide y (npy), but its effect on contents of cholecystokinin octapeptide and gaba was much less significant. the maximal induction of npy content (15‐fold increase) was achieved by 20 ng/ml of bdnf. these changes were also reproduced at the mrna level. in contrast, neurotrophin‐3 was much less potent at increasing npy and som contents, and nerve growth factor had no effect on them. the expression of mrna for npy and som was fully dependent on the presence of bdnf in culture but irrelevant to the survival‐promoting activity of bdnf, which has been reported previously. most of the npy immunoreactivity induced by bdnf was colocalized with glutamate decarboxylase immunoreactivity in cultured cortical neurons. these results suggest that bdnf regulates the peptidergic expression of gabaergic neurons in the cerebral cortex.
in the present study we investigated whether imitation of artificial movement trajectories of meaningless objects has an effect on how these trajectories are later perceptually processed within the human brain. during observation of a sequence of artificial object movements 10 participants (experimental group) actively imitated the trajectories during motor training and 10 participants (control group) solved a working memory task without motor training. the haemodynamic responses were recorded before and after the intervention while participants observed the movements and either had to detect colour changes of one of the objects (colour task, motor‐irrelevant) or had to judge whether the movement pattern could be imitated with the hands (simulation judgement task, motor‐relevant). the between‐group comparison of the post‐intervention haemodynamic responses revealed stronger activity for the motor training than for the control group during the simulation judgement task. this activity appeared in motor‐related areas (supplementary motor area and inferior parietal lobe) and in the occipito‐temporal area. during the colour task, the motor training group showed stronger activity in the occipital lobe. the control group did not reveal any stronger activity than the motor training group for either task. the results suggest that motor training has task‐specific effects on neural processes that are involved in perception of movements. furthermore, they indicate that motor‐related areas are triggered by observed artificial object movements, but only if a motor‐relevant task is pursued. neuroimaging studies have recently provided support for the existence of a human equivalent of the "mirror-neuron" system as first described in monkeys [1], involved in both the execution of movements as well as the observation and imitation of actions performed by others (e.g., [2-6]). a widely held conception concerning this system is that the understanding of observed actions is mediated by a covert simulation process [7]. in the present fmri experiment, this simulation process was probed by asking subjects to discriminate between visually presented trajectories that either did or did not match previously performed but unseen continuous movement sequences. a specific network of learning-related premotor and parietal areas was found to be reactivated when participants were confronted with their movements' visual counterpart. moreover, the strength of these reactivations was dependent on the observers' experience with executing the corresponding movement sequence. these findings provide further support for the emerging view that embodied simulations during action observation engage widespread activations in cortical motor regions beyond the classically defined mirror-neuron system. furthermore, the obtained results extend previous work by showing experience-dependent perceptual modulations at the neural systems level based on nonvisual motor learning.
backgroundprevious research has demonstrated that trained rescuers have difficulties achieving and maintaining the correct depth and rate of chest compressions during both in and out of hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). feedback on rate and depth mitigate decline in performance quality but not completely with the residual performance decline attributed to rescuer fatigue. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of feedback (none, auditory only and visual only) on the quality of cpr and rescuer fatigue.methodsfifteen female volunteers performed 10 minutes of 30:2 cpr in each of three feedback conditions: none, auditory only, and visual only. visual feedback was displayed continuously in graphic form. auditory feedback was error correcting and provided by a voice assisted cpr manikin. cpr quality measures were collected using skillreporter® software. blood lactate (mmol/dl) and perceived exertion served as indices of fatigue. one-way and two way repeated measures analyses of variance were used with alpha set a priori at 0.05.resultsvisual feedback yielded a greater percentage of correct compressions (78.1 ± 8.2%) than did auditory (65.4 ± 7.6%) or no feedback (44.5 ± 8.1%). compression rate with auditory feedback (87.9 ± 0.5 compressions per minute) was less than it was with both visual and no feedback (p < 0.05). cpr performed with no feedback (39.2 ± 0.5 mm) yielded a shallower average depth of compression and a lower percentage (55 ± 8.9%) of compressions within the accepted 38-50 mm range than did auditory or visual feedback (p < 0.05). the duty cycle for auditory feedback (39.4 ± 1.6%) was less than it was with no feedback (p < 0.05). auditory feedback produced lower lactate concentrations than did visual feedback (p < 0.05) but there were no differences in perceived exertion.conclusionsin this study feedback mitigated the negative effects of fatigue on cpr performance and visual feedback yielded better cpr performance than did no feedback or auditory feedback. the perfect confounding of sensory modality and periodicity of feedback (visual feedback provided continuously and auditory feedback provided to correct error) leaves unanswered the question of optimal form and timing of feedback. background cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) guidelines recommend complete release between chest compressions (cc). no study has evaluated prevalence of leaning and the effect of real-time automated audiovisual feedback during in-hospital pediatric cpr.   objectives we hypothesize that leaning during in-hospital pediatric cpr will be common, and that real-time automated feedback will be associated with reduced leaning prevalence and force.   methods a feedback-capable monitor/defibrillator equipped with force transducer and accelerometer recorded cc leaning force and depth during in-hospital cardiac arrests (>/=8 years) at a children's hospital. automated feedback was enabled at the resuscitation leader's discretion, and audiovisual prompts were given when leaning force exceeded 2.5 kg. leaning force and depth cc with no feedback (nof) vs. with feedback (f) were compared.   results 20 pediatric (mean age 14.7+/-3.8 years) pulse less arrests generated 37,396 evaluable cc. median leaning force was 1.6 kg [0.9-2.7 kg] and leaning depth 2.9 (1.6-4.7)mm. leaning force was greater with nof (2.5 kg, [1.6-3.5 kg]; n=1921) vs. f (1.6 kg [0.9-2.6 kg]; n=35,164, p<0.001). leaning>2.5 kg (adult feedback threshold) occurred in 50% (n=969) of cc with nof and 27% (n=9367) cc with f (p<0.001). cc without leaning, defined as a leaning force of<0.5 kg, occurred in 2.2% (n=43) cc with nof vs. 10.5% (n=3681) cc with f (p<0.001).   conclusions leaning (residual force>2.5 kg) was common during pediatric cpr. the prevalence and force of leaning were reduced with automated audiovisual feedback. further study is necessary to determine the effect of the specific leaning threshold on cpr hemodynamics.
abstract the right planum temporale region is typically involved in higher‐order auditory processing. after deafness, this area reorganizes to become sensitive to visual motion. this plasticity is thought to support compensatory enhancements to visual ability. in earlier work we showed that enhanced visual motion detection abilities in early‐deaf people correlate with cortical thickness in a subregion of the right planum temporale. in the current study, we build on this earlier result by examining the relationship between enhanced visual motion detection ability and white matter structure in this area in the same sample. we used diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging and extracted the measures of white matter structure from a region‐of‐interest just below the grey matter surface where cortical thickness correlates with visual motion detection ability. we also tested control regions‐of‐interest in the auditory and visual cortices where we did not expect to find a relationship between visual motion detection ability and white matter. we found that in the right planum temporale subregion, and in no other tested regions, fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity correlated with visual motion detection thresholds. we interpret this change as further evidence of a structural correlate of cross‐modal reorganization after deafness. highlightsright planum temporale structure correlates with visual ability in deaf people.changes are in fractional anisotropy, mean and radial diffusivities.measures indicate altered myelination/axon density, or crossing fibres.evidence that white matter reorganizes to support compensatory visual enhancement. previous brain imaging studies have demonstrated responses to tactile and auditory stimuli in visual cortex of blind subjects, suggesting that removal of one sensory modality leads to neural reorganization of the remaining modalities. to investigate whether similar 'cross-modal' plasticity occurs in human auditory cortex, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to measure visually evoked activity in auditory areas of both early-deafened and hearing individuals. here we find that deaf subjects exhibit activation in a region of the right auditory cortex, corresponding to brodmann's areas 42 and 22, as well as in area 41 (primary auditory cortex), demonstrating that early deafness results in the processing of visual stimuli in auditory cortex.
the concentration of evolutionary breakpoints in primate karyotypes in some particular regions or chromosome bands suggests that these chromosomal regions are more prone to breakage. in this work our aim is to test whether fragile sites (fss) and intrachromosomal telomeric sequences (ttaggg)n are implicated in the evolutionary process of primate chromosomes. for this purpose, we have analyzed: (a) the cytogenetic expression of aphidicolininduced fss at two different aphidicolin concentrations (0.1μmol/l and 0.2μmol/l) in three specimens of cebus apella and cebus nigrivittatus (f. cebidae, platyrrhini) and four specimens of mandrillus sphinx (f. cercopithecidae, catarrhini), and (b) intrachromosomal telomeric sequences (itss) by fluorescent in situ hybridization with a synthetic (ttaggg)n probe in c. apella chromosomes. the use of a multinomial fsm statistical model allowed us to identify 53 fss in c. apella, 16 fss in c. nigrivittatus and 50 fss in m. sphinx. as expected, all telomeres hybridized with the probe, and 55 intrachromosomal loci were also detected. about 40% of the fragile sites detected in the primate species studied are conserved in the corresponding homologous human chromosomes and that a high number of evolutionary chromosomal reorganizations is located in chromosome bands that express fragile sites and/or contain intrachromosomal telomeric sequences. abstract. the intrachromosomal location of the telomeric sequence in the crab-eating macaque, macaca fascicularis (f. cercopithecidae, catarrhini) has been analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation with a long synthetic (ttaggg)n probe. a total of 237 metaphases was analysed. as expected, all telomeres hybridised with the probe and 90 intrachromosomal loci with different hybridisation frequencies were also detected. the chromosomal location of interstitial telomeric sequences in m. fascicularis and in homo sapiens was then compared, 37 sites (41.11%) being found to be conserved. some of these sequences can be derived from rearrangements, such as inversions (mfa13q23) or fusions (mfa2p13 and mfa13p12), that have taken place during karyotype evolution.
kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) is the cause of several tumors, including kaposi sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (pel). most viruses have evolved means of escaping immune recognition. kshv downregulates mhc-i expression during lytic infection, and expression of icam-1 and b7-2 (cd86) during latent infection, allowing evasion of t cell and natural killer immunity respectively. these effects are largely mediated by two kshv-encoded proteins, k3 and k5. we show here that lenalidomide (len) and pomalidomide (pom) prevent down-regulation of mhc-i during lytic activation, and restore icam-1 and b7-2 surface expression in latently infected pel cells. importantly, these changes occurred at clinically achievable concentrations and prior to any cytotoxic effects. exploration of the mechanism revealed that pom blocked lytic down-regulation of mhc-i induced by transfection with k3 but not k5. although pom alone did not significantly increase hla mrna expression in pel cells, it did blunt the butyrate-induced decrease in mhc-i mrna expression and decreased the upregulation of k3 mrna in lytic cells. virus-induced tumors express foreign antigens, but immunotherapy can be thwarted by viral strategies to evade immune recognition. the effects of pom and len described here can prevent these strategies and support the use of these drugs to treat kshv-induced tumors. tnf-alpha mediates both protective and detrimental manifestations of the host immune response. our previous work has shown thalidomide to be a relatively selective inhibitor of tnf-alpha production in vivo and in vitro. additionally, we have recently reported that thalidomide exerts a costimulatory effect on t cell responses. to develop thalidomide analogues with increased anti-tnf-alpha activity and reduced or absent toxicities, novel tnf-alpha inhibitors were designed and synthesized. when a selected group of these compounds was examined for their immunomodulatory activities, different patterns of cytokine modulation were revealed. the tested compounds segregated into two distinct classes: one class of compounds, shown to be potent phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, inhibited tnf-alpha production, increased il-10 production by lps-induced pbmc, and had little effect on t cell activation; the other class of compounds, similar to thalidomide, were not phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors and markedly stimulated t cell proliferation and il-2 and ifn-gamma production. these compounds inhibited tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-6 and greatly increased il-10 production by lps-induced pbmc. similar to thalidomide, the effect of these agents on il-12 production was dichotomous; il-12 was inhibited when pbmc were stimulated with lps but increased when cells were stimulated by cross-linking the tcr. the latter effect was associated with increased t cell cd40 ligand expression. the distinct immunomodulatory activities of these classes of thalidomide analogues may potentially allow them to be used in the clinic for the treatment of different immunopathological disorders.
in degraded soils, establishment of soil-improving legumes can be problematic and requires investment of labour and other resources. we investigated various aspects of managing herbaceous legumes in farmers’ fields in bukoba district, tanzania. biomass and n accumulation by crotalaria grahamiana was 1.1 mg ha−1 and 34 kg n ha−1 when established without farmyard manure (fym) and 3.0 mg ha−1 and 95 kg n ha−1 when established with 2 mg fym  ha−1, and incorporation of the biomass gave an increment of 700 kg ha−1 of grain in the subsequent maize crop. maize grain yield at different application rates of tephrosia candida residues ranged from 1.4 to 3.3 mg ha−1 and from 2.0 to 2.8 mg ha−1 in the high and low rainfall zone, respectively. application of tephrosia biomass at a rate of 2 mg ha−1 had no significant effect on maize yield whereas rates of 4, 6 and 8 mg ha−1 gave comparable yields. apparent n recovery efficiencies at all rates of tephrosia residues were maximally 27 and 13% for the high and low rainfall zones, respectively. mulching with mucuna pruriens suppressed weeds by 49 and 68% and increased maize yield by 57 and 103% compared with the weedy fallow in the respective zones. incorporated residues had a weaker effect on suppressing weeds and poor labour productivity (2 l and 36 kg grain person-day−1) compared with mulched residues (32 and 52 kg grain person-day−1) in the high and low rainfall zone, respectively. these results indicate that if well managed, legume residues have the potential to increase yields of subsequent maize crops on degraded soils. the review summarizes the current status of the utilization of n2-fixing organisms as biofertilizer in rice cultivation. heterotrophic bacteria, free-living cyanobacteria,azolla, and legume green manures are considered with regard to their potential for increasing yield, their current use and the prospects for their use with regard to the identified limiting factors.biological n2 fixation has been the most effective system for sustaining production in low-input traditional rice cultivation. on the other hand, the utilisation of n2-fixing organisms in intensified rice production encounters serious limitations. the utilization of free-living bacteria and cyanobacteria is refrained by their modest potential and the non establishment of inoculated strains.azolla and legumes used as green manures have a high potential as n source, but their utilization is severely limited by socio-economic factors.
abstract protein malnutrition promotes hepatic steatosis, decreases insulin-like growth factor (igf)-i production and retards growth. to identify new molecules involved in such changes, we conducted dna microarray analysis on liver samples from rats fed an isoenergetic low-protein diet for 8 h. we identified the fibroblast growth factor 21 gene (fgf21) as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes under conditions of acute protein malnutrition (p<0·05, false-discovery rate<0·001). in addition, amino acid deprivation increased fgf21 mrna levels in rat liver-derived rl-34 cells (p<0·01). these results suggested that amino acid limitation directly increases fgf21 expression. fgf21 is a polypeptide hormone that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. fgf21 also promotes a growth hormone-resistance state and suppresses igf-i in transgenic mice. therefore, to determine further whether fgf21 up-regulation causes hepatic steatosis and growth retardation after igf-i decrease in protein malnutrition, we fed an isoenergetic low-protein diet to fgf21-knockout (ko) mice. fgf21-ko did not rescue growth retardation and reduced plasma igf-i concentration in these mice. fgf21-ko mice showed greater epididymal white adipose tissue weight and increased hepatic tag and cholesterol levels under protein malnutrition conditions (p<0·05). overall, the results showed that protein deprivation directly increased fgf21 expression. however, growth retardation and decreased igf-i were not mediated by increased fgf21 expression in protein malnutrition. furthermore, fgf21 up-regulation rather appears to have a protective effect against obesity and hepatic steatosis in protein-malnourished animals. objective—fibroblast growth factor 21 (fgf21) has emerged as an important metabolic regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. the aims of the current study are to evaluate the role of fgf21 in energy metabolism and to provide mechanistic insights into its glucose and lipid-lowering effects in a high-fat diet–induced obesity (dio) model. research design and methods—dio or normal lean mice were treated with vehicle or recombinant murine fgf21. metabolic parameters including body weight, glucose, and lipid levels were monitored, and hepatic gene expression was analyzed. energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity were assessed using indirect calorimetry and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp techniques. results—fgf21 dose dependently reduced body weight and whole-body fat mass in dio mice due to marked increases in total energy expenditure and physical activity levels. fgf21 also reduced blood glucose, insulin, and lipid levels and reversed hepatic steatosis. the profound reduction of hepatic triglyceride levels was associated with fgf21 inhibition of nuclear sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and the expression of a wide array of genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. fgf21 also dramatically improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in both lean and dio mice independently of reduction in body weight and adiposity. conclusions—fgf21 corrects multiple metabolic disorders in dio mice and has the potential to become a powerful therapeutic to treat hepatic steatosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.
rationalesecond-generation antipsychotics occupy dopamine d2 receptors and act as antagonists or partial agonists at these receptors. while these drugs alleviate positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, they are less effective for treating cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. dopamine d3 receptors are highly expressed in areas of the brain thought to play a role in the regulation of motivation and reward-related behavior. consequently, the dopamine d3 receptor has become a target for treating negative symptoms in combination with d2 antagonism to treat positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.objectivethe purpose of this study was to determine the cariprazine receptor occupancies in brain for d2 and d3 receptors in patients with schizophrenia.methodsusing [11c]-(+)-phno as a radioligand, positron emission tomography (pet) scans were performed in eight patients at baseline and postdose on days 1, 4, and 15. plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples were analyzed for cariprazine concentrations.resultsa monotonic dose-occupancy relationship was observed for both receptor types. after 2 weeks of treatment, near complete (∼100 %) occupancies were observed for both receptors at a dose of 12 mg/day. at the lowest cariprazine dose (1 mg/day), mean d3 and d2 receptor occupancies were 76 and 45 %, respectively, suggesting selectivity for d3 over d2 receptors at low doses. an exposure-response analysis found a ∼3-fold difference in ec50 (d3 = 3.84 nm and d2 = 13.03 nm) in plasma after 2 weeks of dosing.conclusionthis pet imaging study in patients with schizophrenia demonstrated that cariprazine is a d3-preferring dual d3/d2 receptor partial agonist. we investigated the in vivo effects of orally administered cariprazine (rgh-188; trans-n-{4-[2-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl]-cyclohexyl}-n',n'-dimethyl-urea), a d(3)/d(2) dopamine receptor partial agonist with ∼10-fold preference for the d(3) receptor. oral bioavailability of cariprazine at a dose of 1mg/kg in rats was 52% with peak plasma concentrations of 91ng/ml. cariprazine 10mg/kg had good blood-brain barrier penetration, with a brain/plasma auc ratio of 7.6:1. in rats, cariprazine showed dose-dependent in vivo displacement of [(3)h](+)-phno, a dopamine d(3) receptor-preferring radiotracer, in the d(3) receptor-rich region of cerebellar lobules 9 and 10. its potent inhibition of apomorphine-induced climbing in mice (ed(50)=0.27mg/kg) was sustained for 8h. cariprazine blocked amphetamine-induced hyperactivity (ed(50)=0.12mg/kg) and conditioned avoidance response (car) (ed(50)=0.84mg/kg) in rats, and inhibited the locomotor-stimulating effects of the noncompetitive nmda antagonists mk-801 (ed(50)=0.049mg/kg) and phencyclidine (ed(50)=0.09mg/kg) in mice and rats, respectively. it reduced novelty-induced motor activity of mice (ed(50)=0.11mg/kg) and rats (ed(50)=0.18mg/kg) with a maximal effect of 70% in both species. cariprazine produced no catalepsy in rats at up to 100-fold dose of its car inhibitory ed(50) value. cariprazine 0.02-0.08mg/kg significantly improved the learning performance of scopolamine-treated rats in a water-labyrinth learning paradigm. though risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole showed antipsychotic-like activity in many of these assays, they were less active against phencyclidine and more cataleptogenic than cariprazine, and had no significant effect in the learning task. the distinct in vivo profile of cariprazine may be due to its higher affinity and in vivo binding to d(3) receptors versus currently marketed typical and atypical antipsychotics.
this retrospective study aims to evaluate epidemiologic characteristics of patients attending stop smoking courses, based on group therapy, testing their influence on smoking cessation in univariate and multivariate model. a total of 123 patients were included in this study. mean age was 53 (±11). sixty-seven percent were women. at the end of the courses 66% of patients stopped smoking, after 12 months only 39% remained abstinent. patients younger than 50 years statistically tended to continue smoking 6 months (p = .02–r.r. = 1.49, c.i. 95%: 1.06–2.44) and 12 months (p = .03–r.r. = 1.37, c.i. 95%: 1.02–2.52) after the end of the courses. a low self-confidence in quitting smoking was significantly related to continuing tobacco consumption after 6 months (p = .016–r.r. = 1.84, c.i. 95%: 1.14–2.99). low adherence to therapeutic program was statistically associated to maintenance of tobacco use at 6 months (p = .006–r.r. = 1.76, c.i. 95%: 1.32–2.35) and 12 months (p = .050–r.r. = 1.45, c.i. 95%: 1.11–1.88). this association was confirmed at 6 months in the analysis performed on logistic regression model (p = .013). community-based fresh start courses have been running at local community centres throughout victoria since february 1983. this paper describes the key features of this program and identifies the factors which relate to smoking cessation. data were collected from 3298 participants who attended a program between february 1983 and june 1988. all participants were asked to complete three short questionnaires: on arrival at the course, at the conclusion of the course and a year after finishing the course. although most participants had made previous unsuccessful quit attempts and perceived quitting to be difficult, attendance at the course had a major impact on their reported smoking. at the conclusion of the course at least 51% of participants had quit smoking and the remaining participants had reduced their smoking by an average of 50%. at the 1 year follow-up, at least 23% of participants were non-smokers and the remaining participants had reduced their smoking by an average of 21%. successful quitting at the end of the course and at the 12 month follow-up was positively related to the number of sessions attended and the perceived likelihood of quitting, and negatively related to initial cigarette consumption.
characterisation of fifteen commercial varieties of chrysanthemum was carried out through rapd analysis. varieties could be distinguished from each other and the level of similarity between varieties seemed to be not very high. in vitro cultures were establish from four varieties and were subjected to different proliferation conditions. five individuals from each variety and treatment were analysed using rapd at the beginning of the treatment and after a month of culture. variation was detected at both stages of the culture period. the rate of variation found showed differences between varieties, but no significant difference was found between culture conditions. several techniques of dna analysis were applied to identify chrysanthemum cultivars. unrelated cultivars could be distinguished by using rapds (random amplified polymorphic dnas), inter-ssr (simple sequence repeat) pcr (polymerase chain reaction), hybridization-based dna fingerprinting, as well as rflps (restriction fragment length polymorphisms). cultivars with different flower colours and belonging to one family, i.e. vegetatively derived from 1 cultivar, appeared to have the same dna fragment patterns, whichever technique was applied. the absence of polymorphisms between different accessions of the same cultivar indicated a high stability of the observed patterns.
purposethis study was directed to investigate the neuromuscular function of the plantar flexors and tibialis anterior (ta) before and after 8 weeks of balance training.methodstwenty-six young adult subjects were randomly assigned to an intervention group and a control group. during neuromuscular testing, rate of torque development (rtd), isometric maximum voluntary torque (imvt) and muscle activation were measured. triceps surae muscle activation and ta muscle co-activation were assessed by normalized root mean square of the emg signal during the initial phase of contraction (0–100, 0–200 ms) and maximum voluntary contraction (mvc) of the plantar flexors. furthermore, evoked spinal reflex responses of the soleus muscle (h-reflex evoked at rest and during mvc, v-wave), peak twitch torques induced by electrical stimulation at rest and balance performance were evaluated.resultswe found a significant difference between groups in rtd of the plantar flexors during mvc in the time interval 0–100 ms [37.0 n m s−1 (4.2–69.9 n m s−1, p = 0.029)]. this change was accompanied by reduced antagonistic muscle co-activity. the normalized h-reflex of the soleus muscle at rest as well as the sway of the center of pressure during balance performance assessment were significantly lower for the intervention group compared with controls. the training intervention had no effect on imvt, normalized muscle activity of the plantar flexors, normalized muscle activity of ta, normalized v-wave and normalized h-reflex evoked during mvc.conclusiondata suggest that balance training reduced antagonistic muscle co-activity at the onset of triceps surae contraction and, in turn, increased isometric explosive voluntary strength of the plantar flexors. balancing exercises on instable bases (sensorimotor training [smt]) are often used in the rehabilitation process of an injured athlete to restore joint function. recently it was shown that smt was able to enhance rate of force development (rfd) in a maximal voluntary muscle contraction. the purpose of this study was to compare adaptations on strength capacity following ballistic strength training (bst) with those following an smt during a training period of 1 microcycle (4 weeks). maximum voluntary isometric strength (mvc), maximum rfd (rfdmax) and the corresponding neural activation of m. soleus (sol), m. gastrocnemius (gas), and m. tibialis anterior (tib) were measured during plantar flexion in 33 healthy subjects. the subjects were randomly assigned to a smt, bst, or control group. rfdmax increased significantly stronger following bst (48 ± 16%; p < 0.01) compared to smt (14 ± 5%; p < 0.05), whereas mvc remained unchanged in both groups. median frequencies of the electromyographic power spectrum during the first 200 ms of contraction for gas increased following both bst (45 ± 21%; p < 0.05) and smt (45 ± 22%; p < 0.05), but median frequencies for sol increased only after smt (13 ± 4%; p < 0.05). additionally, mean amplitude voltage increased following bst for sol (38 ± 12%; p < 0.01) and for gas (73 ± 23%; p < 0.01) during the first 100 ms, whereas it remained unchanged after smt. it is concluded that bst and smt may induce different neural adaptations that specifically affect recruitment and discharge rates of motor units at the beginning of voluntary contraction. specific neural adaptations indicate that smt might be used complementarily to bst, especially in sports that require contractile explosive properties in situations with high postural demands, e.g., during jumps in ball sports.
objectives venous thromboembolism (vte) is a serious complication after intracranial meningioma surgery. to what extent systemic prophylaxis with pharmacotherapy is beneficial with respect to vte risk, or associated with increased risk of bleeding and postoperative hemorrhage, remains debated. the current study aimed to clarify the risk/benefit ratio of prophylactic pharmacotherapy initiated the evening before craniotomy for meningioma.   methods in a scandinavian population-based cohort, we conducted a retrospective review of 979 operations for intracranial meningioma between 2007 and 2013 at 3 neurosurgical centers with population-based referral. we compared 2 different treatment strategies analyzing frequencies of vte and proportions of postoperative intracranial hematomas requiring surgery or intensified subsequent observation or care (intensive care unit or other intensified observation or treatment). one neurosurgical center favored preoperative prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (lmwh) (lmwh routine group) in addition to mechanical prophylaxis, and 2 centers favored mechanical prophylaxis with lmwh only given as needed in cases of delayed mobilization (lmwh as needed group).   results in the lmwh routine group, vte was diagnosed after 24/626 operations (3.9%), and vte was diagnosed after 11/353 (3.1%) operations in the lmwh as needed group (p = 0.56). clinically relevant postoperative hematomas occurred after 57/626 operations (9.1%) in the lmwh routine group compared with 23/353 (6.5%) in the lmwh as needed group (p = 0.16). surgically evacuated postoperative hematomas occurred after 19/626 operations (3.0%) in the lmwh routine group compared with 8/353 operations (2.3%) in the lmwh as needed group (p = 0.26).   conclusions there is no benefit of routine preoperative lmwh starting before intracranial meningioma surgery. neither could we for primary outcomes detect a significant increase in clinically relevant postoperative hematomas secondary to this regimen. we suggest that as needed perioperative administration of lmwh, reserved for patients with excess risk because of delayed mobilization, is effective and also appears to be the safest strategy. individuals with brain tumors have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (vte). within this population, patients with meningiomas have been reported to have the highest incidence, exceeding rates associated with gliomas and brain metastases. however, earlier studies did not employ vte prophylaxis, and vte were detected with radionuclide scans, the reliability of which has since been questioned. therefore, we conducted a retrospective review of postoperative meningioma patients receiving contemporary vte prophylaxis and diagnostic methods to define the current incidence of and risk factors for symptomatic vte in this population.
up to date, information concerning the anaplasma phagocytophilum infection in fallow deer is scant, therefore, to verify its prevalence in these ungulates serological and pcr screenings were performed on blood of 72 fallow deer hunted in a central-northern italian preserve. molecular analyses were also performed on 90 ticks removed from the animals. a. phagocytophilum infection in fallow deer was confirmed in 20 out 72 by ifa assay and in 11 out 72 by pcr. the sequence obtained revealed a complete genetic homology among the blood samples and strong degrees of homology with other european isolates. considering the 90 ticks collected we found that 7.3% of ixodes ricinus harboured a. phagocytophilum specific dna. the data obtained confirmed that fallow deer can be a competent host for a. phagocytophilum and, therefore, that may represent a biological reservoir playing an important role in the epidemiological scenarios of the infection, in the geographical areas where is widespread. seasons. roe deer were sampled during the summer and the fall in 10 districts (czarnkow, krzykosy, oborniki, margonin, miedzychod, murowana-goslina, poniec, sierakow, trzcian- ka, wielen ´ ), whereas samples from red and fallow deer were obtained only during the fall in nine (listed above with the exception of krykosy) and two districts (margonin, murowa- na-goslina), respectively. in total, 238 partially or fully engorged female and 63 non-engorged male i. ricinus ticks were obtained from 51 animals (20 fallow deer, 18 roe deer and 13 red deer). total dna was extracted from blood and i. ricinus ticks using the genomic mini ax blood (a&a biotechnology, gdynia, poland) and sherlock ax kit (a&a biotechnology), respec- tively. blood and tick samples were analysed for the presence of a. phagocytophilum dna by pcr using three different primer sets: ehr521-ehr747, la6-la1 and hge396-hge921, based on the sequences of the 16s rdna, anka and hge-44 genes, respectively (4,5). pcr products were considered positive when a. phagocytophilum dna was detected by at least two primer sets. additionally, selected pcr-positive samples tested with the primers la6-la1 specific for a 444-bp region of the anka gene were sequenced with the abi prism 3100 genetic analyser (applied biosystem 850, foster city, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer's protocol. sequences were edited and compared with gene sequences deposited in the genbank database using the ncbi blast program (u.s. national institute of health, bethesda, maryland).
an important characteristic of arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) symbiosis is the transfer of phosphate from am fungi to plants. this transfer is facilitated by mycorrhiza-inducible phosphate transporter proteins. lysophosphatidylcholine (lpc) stimulates mycorrhiza-inducible phosphate transporter gene expression. this study aims to detect the pattern of five petunia hybrida phosphate transporter (phpt1–5) genes associated with am development and their response to lpc in petunia roots. using the method of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), we explored the transcriptional changes of phpt1–5 genes. our results reveal that the phpt4 transcript level is enhanced by 8,320-fold at 40 days after inoculation in mycorrhizal roots compared with uninoculated roots. however, phpt4 is depressed by lpc, which acts as a mycorrhiza signal in several mycorrhizal plants. our results suggest that phpt4 is a mycorrhiza-specific phosphate transporter and lpc is not always a universal signal in am fungi–plant symbiosis. the arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) symbiosis represents the most widely distributed mutualistic root symbiosis. we report that root extracts of mycorrhizal plants contain a lipophilic signal capable of inducing the phosphate transporter genes stpt3 and stpt4 of potato (solanum tuberosum l.), genes that are specifically induced in roots colonized by am fungi. the same signal caused rapid extracellular alkalinization in suspension-cultured tomato (solanum lycopersicum l.) cells and induction of the mycorrhiza-specific phosphate transporter gene lept4 in these cells. the active principle was characterized as the lysolipid lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lpc) via a combination of gene expression studies, alkalinization assays in cell cultures, and chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses. our results highlight the importance of lysophospholipids as signals in plants and in particular in the am symbiosis.
various cells types, including stem and progenitor cells, can exchange complex information via plasma membrane-derived vesicles, which can carry signals both in their limiting membrane and lumen. astrocytes, traditionally regarded as mere supportive cells, play previously unrecognized functions in neuronal modulation and are capable of releasing signalling molecules of different functional significance. in the present study, we provide direct evidence that human fetal astrocytes in culture, expressing the same feature as immature and reactive astrocytes, release membrane vesicles larger than the microvesicles described up to now. we found that these large vesicles, ranging from 1–5 to 8 μm in diameter and expressing on their surface β1-integrin proteins, contain mitochondria and lipid droplets together with atp. we documented vesicle content with fluorescent-specific dyes and with the immunocytochemistry technique we confirmed that mitochondria and lipid droplets were co-localized in the same vesicle. scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that astrocytes shed from surface membrane vesicles of the same size as the ones detected by fluorescence microscopy. our results report for the first time that cultured astrocytes, activated by repetitive stimulation of atp released from neighboring cells, shed from their surface large membrane vesicles containing mitochondria and lipid droplets. we have earlier shown that microglia, the immune cells of the cns, release microparticles from cell plasma membrane after atp stimulation. these vesicles contain and release il‐1β, a crucial cytokine in cns inflammatory events. in this study, we show that microparticles are also released by astrocytes and we get insights into the mechanism of their shedding. we show that, on activation of the atp receptor p2x7, microparticle shedding is associated with rapid activation of acid sphingomyelinase, which moves to plasma membrane outer leaflet. atp‐induced shedding and il‐1β release are markedly reduced by the inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase, and completely blocked in glial cultures from acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice. we also show that p38 mapk cascade is relevant for the whole process, as specific kinase inhibitors strongly reduce acid sphingomyelinase activation, microparticle shedding and il‐1β release. our results represent the first demonstration that activation of acid sphingomyelinase is necessary and sufficient for microparticle release from glial cells and define key molecular effectors of microparticle formation and il‐1β release, thus, opening new strategies for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.
abstract   termites live in nests that can differ in microbial load and thus vary in degree of disease risk. it was hypothesized that termite investment in immune response would differ in species living in nest environments that vary in the richness and abundance of microbes. using the drywood termite, incisitermes schwarzi banks (isoptera: kalotermitidae), as a model for species having low nest and cuticular microbial loads, the susceptibility of individuals and groups to conidia of the entomopathogenic fungus, metarhizium anisopliae sorokin (hypocreales: clavicipitaceae), was examined. the survivorship of i. schwarzi was compared to that of the dampwood termite, zootermopsis angusticollis hagen (termopsidae), a species with comparatively high microbial loads. the results indicated that i. schwarzi derives similar benefits from group living as z. angusticollis: isolated termites had 5.5 times the hazard ratio of death relative to termites nesting in groups of 25 while termites in groups of 10 did not differ significantly from the groups of 25. the results also indicated, after controlling for the influence of group size and conidia exposure on survivorship, that z. angusticollis was significantly more susceptible to fungal infection than i. schwarzi, the former having 1.6 times the hazard ratio of death relative to drywood termites. thus, disease susceptibility and individual investment in immunocompetence may not be dependent on interspecific variation in microbial pressures. the data validate prior studies indicating that sociality has benefits in infection control and suggest that social mechanisms of disease resistance, rather than individual physiological and immunological adaptations, may have been the principle target of selection related to variation in infection risk from microbes in the nest environment of different termite species. abstract the benefit of sociality in relation to disease susceptibility was studied in the dampwood termite zootermopsis angusticollis. although contact with high concentrations of fungal conidia is lethal, the survivorship of nymphs exposed to spore suspensions ranging from 6 × 106 to 2 × 108 spores/ml of the fungus metarhizium anisopliae increased with group size. the survivorship (measured as lt50) of isolated individuals ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 days, but infected nymphs living in groups of 10 and 25 individuals survived significantly longer (5.6–8.3 and 5.6–9.1 days, respectively). in most cases, there were no significant differences in the survival distributions of the 10- and 25-termite groups. when nymphs were infected with concentrations of 7 × 101–7 × 104 spores/ml and allowed to interact with healthy nestmates, fungal infections were not contracted by the unexposed termites. moreover, infected termites benefitted from social contact with unexposed nestmates: their survival rates were significantly higher than those of infected termites living with similarly infected nestmates. allogrooming, which increased in frequency during and after exposure to conidia, appeared to remove potentially infectious spores from the cuticle, thus increasing termite survivorship. these results suggest that allogrooming plays a crucial role in the control of disease and its death hazard in termites. the infection-reducing advantage of group living may have been significant in the evolution of social behavior in the isoptera.
context an autopsy case of cytomegalovirus (cmv) associated with fatal severe pancreatitis is reported.   case report a 76-year-old man presented with high fever and was admitted to our hospital for evaluation. imaging modalities, including chest x-ray, ct and mri, revealed interstitial pneumonia. blood laboratory tests showed positive anti-nuclear antigen (x 80), but collagen diseases were not identified. the patient was treated with steroids (prednisolone 30 mg/day). two months later, the patient developed acute abdominal pain. serum laboratory tests revealed an elevated amylase level (1,296 iu/l), and ct demonstrated acute pancreatitis. the patient died of multiple organ failure from the acute pancreatitis three days after the onset of the acute pancreatitis. an autopsy revealed severe necrotizing acute pancreatitis. numerous large inclusions of cmv were found in the acinar and ductal cells of the pancreas. numerous cmv inclusions were also seen in the degenerated and necrotic pancreatic acinar cells. cmv-infected cells were immunohistochemically positive for cmv antigen, cmv early antigen and cmv late antigen, indicating active replication and regression of cmv.   conclusion the findings strongly suggest that severe cmv infection can occur after steroid administration, and that cmv infection can be the cause of severe fatal acute necrotizing pancreatitis. diffuse pulmonary small nodules and pyrexia suddenly developed in a 27-year-old woman during immunosuppressive treatment for viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. miliary tuberculosis was suspected, however, bone marrow biopsy did not support the diagnosis. lung biopsy revealed interstitial pneumonitis admixed with characteristic inclusion-bearing cells, and cytomegalovirus (cmv) dna was demonstrated in polymerase chain reaction using bronchoalveolar lavage cells, establishing the diagnosis of cmv pneumonitis. no other opportunistic pathogens were identified, and the pneumonitis was subsided due to administration of gancyclovir. the present case illustrates cmv pneumonitis as a differential diagnosis for small nodular opacities which develop in immunocompromised patients.
bmi1, a stem cell factor and member of the polycomb group of genes, has been shown to contribute to growth and chemoresistance of several human malignancies including primary osteosarcoma (osa). naturally occurring osa in the dog represents a large animal model of human osa, however the potential role of bmi1 in canine primary and metastatic osa has not been examined. immunohistochemical staining of canine primary and metastatic osa tumors revealed strong nuclear expression of bmi1. an identical staining pattern was found in both primary and metastatic human osa tissues. canine osa cell lines (abrams, moresco, and d17) expressed high levels of bmi1 compared with canine osteoblasts and knockdown or inhibition of bmi1 by sirna or by small molecule bmi1-inhibitor ptc-209 demonstrated a role for bmi1 in canine osa cell growth and resistance to carboplatin and doxorubicin chemotherapy. these findings suggest that inhibition of bmi1 in primary or metastatic osa may improve response to chemotherapy and that the dog may serve as a large animal model to evaluate such therapy. there is increasing evidence that a variety of cancers arise from transformation of normal stem cells to cancer stem cells (cscs). cscs are thought to sustain cancer progression, invasion, metastasis, and recurrence after therapy. reports suggest that cscs are highly resistant to conventional therapy. emerging evidences show that the chemoresistance of cscs are in part due to the activation of b cell‐specific moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (bmi1), a stem cell factor, and a polycomb group family member. bmi1 is reported to regulate the proliferation activity of normal, stem, and progenitor cells. bmi1 plays a role in cell cycle, cell immortalization, and senescence. numerous studies demonstrate that bmi1, which is upregulated in a variety of cancers, has a positive correlation with clinical grade/stage and poor prognosis. although evidences are in support of the role of bmi1 as a factor in chemoresistance displayed by cscs, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. in this review, we provide summary of evidences (with mechanism of action established) suggesting the significance of bmi1 in chemoresistance and recurrence of cscs. stem cells 2012;30:372–378
dynamic contrast imaging techniques are considered the standard of care for the radiological diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) in cirrhosis. however, the accuracy of radiological diagnosis depends largely on the degree of arterial hypervascularization, which increases with tumor size. owing to the interplay and prognostic relevance of tumor vascularization and cell differentation, we asked ourselves whether tumor grade also affects the outcome of radiological diagnosis. sixty‐two hccs (47 of which measured 1‐2 cm) were consecutively detected in 59 patients with compensated cirrhosis under surveillance with ultrasound and confirmed by way of echo‐guided biopsy and concurrent investigations with contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (ce‐us), computed tomography (ct), and gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (mri). tumor cell differentiation was evaluated using edmondson‐steiner criteria in liver cores of 0.9‐5.0 cm (median 1.6 cm). eighteen (29%) hccs were grade i (1.5 cm), 28 (45%) were grade ii (1.5 cm), 16 (26%) were grade iii (1.8 cm), and none were grade iv. contrast wash‐in and wash‐out were concurrently demonstrated in 21 (34%) tumors by way of ce‐us, including three (16%) grade i and 18 (41%) grade ii‐iii (p = 0.08); in 32 (52%) tumors by way of ct, including three (16%) grade i and 29 (66%) grade ii‐iii (p = 0.0006); and 28 (47%) tumors by way of mri, including three grade i (16%) and 25 (57%) grade ii‐iii (p = 0.01). among 1‐ to 2‐cm tumors, the radiological diagnosis was achieved in two of 16 grade i and 17of 31 grade ii‐iii tumors (p = 0.006). conclusion: tumor grade, a relevant predictor of disease severity, influences the accuracy of dynamic contrast techniques in the diagnosis of hcc. hepatology 2010 background contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ce-us), contrast ct scan and gadolinium dynamic mri are recommended for the characterisation of liver nodules detected during surveillance of patients with cirrhosis with us. aim to assess the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and economic impact of all possible sequential combinations of contrast imaging techniques in patients with cirrhosis with 1–2 cm liver nodules undergoing us surveillance. patients/methods 64 patients with 67 de novo liver nodules (55 with a size of 1–2 cm) were consecutively examined by ce-us, ct, mri, and a fine-needle biopsy (fnb) as diagnostic standard. undiagnosed nodules were re-biopsied; non-malignant nodules underwent enhanced imaging follow-up. the typical radiological feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) was arterial phase hypervascularisation followed by portal/venous phase washout. results hcc was diagnosed in 44 (66%) nodules (2, <1 cm; 34, 1–2 cm; 8, >2 cm). the sensitivity of ce-us, ct and mri for 1–2 cm hcc was 26, 44 and 44%, with 100% specificity, the typical vascular pattern of hcc being identified in 22 (65%) by a single technique versus 12 (35%) by at least two techniques carried out at the same time point (p=0.028). compared with the cheapest dual examination (ce-us+ct), the cheapest single technique of stepwise imaging diagnosis of hcc was equally expensive (€26 440 vs €28 667), but led to a 23% reduction of fnb procedures (p=0.031). conclusions in patients with cirrhosis with a 1–2 cm nodule detected during surveillance, a single imaging technique showing a typical contrast pattern confidently permits the diagnosis of hcc, thereby reducing the need for fnb examinations.
background: anti-microbial hexapeptides trap holliday junctions and inhibit junction-processing enzymes. results: hexapeptides induce multiple conformations and dynamic fluctuations of two holliday junctions that differ in core sequence. conclusion: destabilization of the functional junction conformation likely contributes to inhibition of enzymes that process holliday junctions. significance: ligand-induced conformational dynamics may contribute generally to the action of anti-microbial agents that target specialized dna structures. holliday junctions are critical intermediates in dna recombination, repair, and restart of blocked replication. hexapeptides have been identified that bind to junctions and inhibit various junction-processing enzymes, and these peptides confer anti-microbial and anti-tumor properties. earlier studies suggested that inhibition results from stabilization of peptide-bound holliday junctions in the square planar conformation. here, we use single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smfret) and two model junctions, which are at- or gc-rich at the branch points, to show that binding of the peptide kwwcrw induces a dynamic ensemble of junction conformations that differs from both the square planar and stacked x conformations. the specific features of the conformational distributions differ for the two peptide-bound junctions, but both junctions display greatly decreased mg2+ dependence and increased conformational fluctuations. the smfret results, complemented by gel mobility shift and small angle x-ray scattering analyses, reveal structural effects of peptides and highlight the sensitivity of smfret for analyzing complex mixtures of dna structures. the peptide-induced conformational dynamics suggest multiple stacking arrangements of aromatic amino acids with the nucleobases at the junction core. this conformational heterogeneity may inhibit dna processing by increasing the population of inactive junction conformations, thereby preventing the binding of processing enzymes and/or resulting in their premature dissociation. holliday junctions (hj) are the central intermediates in both homologous recombination and site-specific recombination performed by tyrosine recombinases such as the bacteriophage lambda integrase (int) protein. previously, our lab identified peptide inhibitors of int-mediated recombination that prevent the resolution of hj intermediates. we now show that two of these inhibitors bind hj dna in the square-planar conformation even in the absence of int protein. the peptides prevent unwinding of branched dna substrates by the recg helicase of escherichia coli and interfere with the resolution of hj substrates by the ruvabc complex. our results suggest that these peptides target all proteins that process hj in the square-planar conformation. these inhibitors should be extremely useful for dissecting homologous recombination and recombination-dependent repair in vitro and in vivo.
purpose: molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (ctc) holds great promise. unfortunately, routinely isolated ctc fractions currently still contain contaminating leukocytes, which makes ctc-specific molecular characterization extremely challenging. in this study, we determined mrna and microrna (mirna) expression of potentially ctc-specific genes that are considered to be clinically relevant in breast cancer. experimental design: ctcs were isolated with the epithelial cell adhesion molecule–based cellsearch profile kit. selected genes were measured by real-time reverse transcriptase pcr in ctcs of 50 metastatic breast cancer patients collected before starting first-line systemic therapy in blood from 53 healthy blood donors (hbd) and in primary tumors of 8 of the patients. the molecular profiles were associated with ctc counts and clinical parameters and compared with the profiles generated from the corresponding primary tumors. results: we identified 55 mrnas and 10 mirnas more abundantly expressed in samples from 32 patients with at least 5 ctcs in 7.5 ml of blood compared with samples from 9 patients without detectable ctcs and hbds. clustering analysis resulted in 4 different patient clusters characterized by 5 distinct gene clusters. twice the number of patients from cluster 2 to 4 had developed both visceral and nonvisceral metastases. comparing transcript levels in ctcs with those measured in corresponding primary tumors showed clinically relevant discrepancies in estrogen receptor and her2 levels. conclusions: our study shows that molecular profiling of low numbers of ctcs in a high background of leukocytes is feasible and shows promise for further studies on the clinical relevance of molecular characterization of ctcs. clin cancer res; 17(11); 3600–18. ©2011 aacr. introductionwhen breast cancer patients develop distant metastases, the choice of systemic treatment is usually based on tissue characteristics of the primary tumor as determined by immunohistochemistry (ihc) and/or molecular analysis. several previous studies have shown that the immunophenotype of distant breast cancer metastases may be different from that of the primary tumor (receptor conversion), leading to inappropriate choice of systemic treatment. the studies published so far are however small and/or methodologically suboptimal. therefore, definite conclusions that may change clinical practice could not yet be drawn. we therefore aimed to study receptor conversion for estrogen receptor alpha (erα), progesterone receptor (pr), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) in a large group of distant (non-bone) breast cancer metastases by re-staining all primary tumors and metastases with current optimal immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods on full sections.methodsa total of 233 distant breast cancer metastases from different sites (76 skin, 63 liver, 43 lung, 44 brain and 7 gastro-intestinal) were ihc stained for erα, pr and her2, and expression was compared to that of the primary tumor. her2 in situ hybridization (ish) was done in cases of ihc conversion or when primary tumors or metastases showed an ihc 2+ result.resultsusing a 10% threshold, receptor conversion by ihc for erα, pr occurred in 10.3%, 30.0% of patients, respectively. in 10.7% of patients, conversion from er+ or pr+ to er-/pr- and in 3.4% from er-/pr- to er+ or pr+ was found. using a 1% threshold, erα and pr conversion rates were 15.1% and 32.6%. in 12.4% of patients conversion from er+ or pr+ to er-/pr-, and 8.2% from er-/pr- to er+ or pr+ occurred. her2 conversion occurred in 5.2%. of the 12 cases that showed her2 conversion by ihc, 5 showed also conversion by ish. one further case showed conversion by ish, but not by ihc. conversion was mainly from positive in the primary tumor to negative in the metastases for erα and pr, while her2 conversion occurred equally both ways. pr conversion occurred significantly more often in liver, brain and gastro-intestinal metastases.conclusionsreceptor conversion by immunohistochemistry in (non-bone) distant breast cancer metastases does occur, is relatively uncommon for erα and her2, and is more frequent for pr, especially in brain, liver and gastro-intestinal metastases.
a significant proportion of children (up to 7% in the uk) present with pronounced language difficulties that cannot be explained by obvious causes like other neurological and medical conditions. a substantial genetic component is predicted to underlie such language problems. copy number variants (cnvs) have been implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia, but it is not fully established to what extent they might contribute to language disorders. we conducted a cnv screen in a longitudinal cohort of young children with language-related difficulties (n = 85), focusing on single events at candidate loci. we detected a de novo deletion on chromosome 15q13.1–13.3. the adjacent 15q11-13.1 locus is disrupted in prader-willi and angelman syndromes, while disruptions across the breakpoints (bp1-bp6) have previously been implicated in different neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism, intellectual disability (id), seizures and developmental delay (dd). this is the first report of a deletion at bp3-bp5 being linked to a deficit confined to language impairment, in the absence of id, expanding the range of phenotypes that implicate the chromosome 15q13 locus. copy number variation has emerged as an important type of genetic risk factor for developmental disorders, including the neurodevelopmental disorders schizophrenia, autism and mental retardation. the highly pleiotropic effects observed for specific copy number variants (cnvs) challenge current classification of these disorders, but also provide opportunities to understand their origins and the relationships between them.
objective the objective of this study is to explore and compare the prevalence of categorical and dimensional personality disorders (pds) and their severity in spanish adolescents with eating disorders (eds).   method diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition and international classification of diseases, tenth revision-10 modules of the international personality disorder examination were administered to a sample of 100 female adolescents with eds (mean age=15.8 years, sd=0.9).   results 'thirty-three per cent of the sample had at least one pd, in most cases a simple pd. the rate of pds was 64-76% in bulimia patients, 22-28% in anorexia and 25% in eds not otherwise specified. the highest dimensional scores were observed in bulimia, [corrected] mainly in borderline and histrionic pds, and higher scores for anankastic pd in anorexia than in the other ed diagnoses. overall, purging type eds had higher cluster b personality pathology scores than restrictive type.'

the aim of the study described here was to compare ultrasound features, pathologic characteristics and prognoses of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (fvptc) according to cytology results. eighty-seven fvptcs were classified according to the first cytology results as the surgery group (n = 66, follicular neoplasm/hürthle cell neoplasm, suspicious for malignancy and malignancy) and the indeterminate group (n = 21, non-diagnostic and benign), for whom the management was follow-up. the indeterminate group had a longer mean interval to surgery (p = 0.020) and larger tumor size (p = 0.018). more tumors were assessed as probably benign in the indeterminate group than in the surgery group (p < 0.001). extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastasis did not significantly differ between the two groups, and no patient had a recurrence (mean follow-up interval: 54.9 ± 16.9 mo). the indeterminate group exhibited more probably benign features and larger size on ultrasound, with surgery being performed at a later date. however, aggressive pathologic characteristics and tumor recurrence did not significantly differ between the two groups. background follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (fv-ptc) has been increasingly diagnosed in recent years. however, little is known about its clinical behavior. the purpose of this study was to determine the disease characteristics of fv-ptc, and to compare it with classical papillary thyroid carcinoma (c-ptc) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (ftc).   methods all cases of c-ptc, fv-ptc, and ftc larger than 1 cm in the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (seer) cancer database from 1988 to 2007 were identified. tumor behavior and patient survival were compared among these three groups. different risk factors for disease-specific mortality in each group were evaluated by multivariate analysis.   results more than 36,000 surgical cases were identified, including 21,796 c-ptcs, 10,740 fv-ptcs, and 3958 ftcs. extrathyroidal extension and lymph-node metastases were more common in fv-ptc than in ftc, but significantly less common than in c-ptc (p<0.0001). distant metastasis rates were present in 2% of patients with fv-ptc, in 1% with c-ptc, and in 4% with ftc (p<0.0001). the 10-year disease-specific survival for patients with fv-ptc was 98%, similar to c-ptc (97%) but better than ftc (94%, p<0.0001). being over the age of 45 years remained a strong risk factor for disease-specific mortality in both fv-ptc and c-ptc, while the presence of extrathyroidal extension and distant metastases were stronger predictors of disease-specific mortality in fv-ptc than in c-ptc.   conclusions fv-ptc is a common variant of ptc. its clinical behavior is unique and represents an intermediate entity with clinical features that are between c-ptc and ftc. interestingly, despite the variations in clinical behavior, the long-term outcome of these patients remains excellent and similar to c-ptc.
predictive value for continuously reinforced cues is affected by context changes when they are trained within a context in which a different cue undergoes partial reinforcement. an experiment was conducted with the goal of exploring the mechanisms underlying this context-switch effect. human participants were trained in a predictive learning situation in which a cue received partial reinforcement while a target cue received continuous reinforcement in context a (c1) and another target cue was presented unreinforced in context b (u2). participants in group partial-one did not receive partial reinforcement in context b, while participants in group partial-both received the same training they received in context a, but with different cues. when target cues were tested in group partial-one, greater responding in context a than in context b was found. differences were smaller in cue u2 than in cue c1. no differences across contexts were found in group partial-both. these results are in agreement with the hypothesis that context-switch effects after partial reinforcement are mainly due to the formation of direct context-outcome associations, though the difference on the effect size on the reinforced and unreinforced cues suggests that a modulator mechanism may be also responsible for these context-switch effects. contextual conditioning during relative validity training was explored in 3 experiments that used an appetitive pavlovian conditioning preparation with rats. magazine entries were the conditioned response. in experiment 1, true-discrimination (td: ax+, bx-) training generated weaker conditioning of x than did pseudodiscrimination (pd: ax+/-, bx+/-) training. the context showed a similar relative validity effect. also, both pd training and simple partial reinforcement (x+/-) reduced contextual conditioning more than did unsignaled food, a demonstration of relative validity using partial reinforcement. experiments 2 and 3 used within-subject and between-subjects designs, respectively, and showed that relative validity was determined by the summation of differences in conditioning to both the common element (x) and the context. our results are consistent with an attentional model or with a computational comparator model but not with the rescorla-wagner (r. a. rescorla & a. r. wagner, 1972) model.
tree-ring width chronologies from 276 larix gmelinii cores taken in northeastern china were used to analyze spatial and age-dependent growth–climate response relationships. tree radial growth from five localities showed similar patterns, while exhibiting different tree-ring growth responses to local climate. the rotated principal component analysis (rpca) indicated that tree age, growing season moisture conditions, and ambient air temperature variations resulted from location differences (e.g., longitude, latitude, and altitude), which could explain the non-stationary spatial climate–growth relations observed. the study tested the fundamental assumption that the climate–growth of l. gmelinii was age independent after the removal of size trends and disturbance signals. the age-related climate–growth relationship might potentially improve the veracity of past climate reconstructions. bootstrapped correlation function analyses suggested that the response of l. gmelinii radial growth to climate differed between trees ≥150 years old and <150 years old. mean sensitivity and standard deviation for trees increased with age in the <150 years old tree class; whereas trees ≥150 years old had no significant relationship with age. these results showed that the assumption of age-independent climate–growth relationship is invalid at these sites. physiological processes and/or hydraulic constraints dependent on tree age, together with detrending techniques could be the possible causal factors of clear age-dependent responses. these results suggested the importance of incorporating trees of all ages into the chronology to recover a detailed climatic signal in a reconstruction of l. gmelinii for this region. qilian juniper (sabina przewalskii kom.) is one of the dominant tree species on qinghai-tibetan plateau and has been used in dendroclimatological studies. here we designed a test to examine whether or not the climate–growth responses in tree rings of qilian juniper vary with the change in tree's age. a total number of 135 increment cores were sampled from qilian juniper trees at five sites, in which 112 cores were selected and grouped into five 100-year age classes for analysis of age-dependent climate–growth relationships. chronology statistics, response functions and anova f-test were used to test the consistency of five age-class mean chronologies (agcs). the results showed that mean sensitivity (ms) and standard deviation (sd) did not change significantly with age. response function analysis indicated that (a) climate accounts for a high amount of variance in tree-ring widths; (b) tree-ring growth has significant positive correlation with mean monthly air temperature of previous october and november, and with total monthly precipitation of current january and june, while has significant negative correlation with mean monthly air temperature of current may; and (c) agc-2, agc-3 and agc-4 have stronger response to climate change than agc-1 and agc-5. the anova f-test showed that generally there are significant differences between the first age class and other four age classes, but among the four classes in which trees are older than 200 years, the differences are usually insignificant. overall the long-lived qilian juniper is still an ideal tree species for dendroclimatic reconstruction.
this study examined whether peer rejection and affiliation with deviant friends throughout childhood could mediate the link between early disruptiveness and two aspects of delinquent behaviors (i.e., violence and substance use) in a sample of 375 children. furthermore, we tested whether the two putative mediators operated in a sequential manner or in a parallel manner. participants' disruptiveness, peer rejection, and friends' deviancy were assessed throughout childhood (ages 7 to 13). delinquency-related outcomes were assessed at ages 14 and 15 years. results indicate that the sequential mediational model was supported when delinquency-related violence was the outcome, but not when substance use was the outcome. the discussion stresses the differential role of peer rejection and affiliation with deviant friends in regard to the two outcomes considered in this study and in regard to the time frame when they were measured. this study assessed the hypothesis that popularity in adolescence takes on a twofold role, marking high levels of concurrent adaptation but predicting increases over time in both positive and negative behaviors sanctioned by peer norms. multimethod, longitudinal data, on a diverse community sample of 185 adolescents (13 to 14 years), addressed these hypotheses. as hypothesized, popular adolescents displayed higher concurrent levels of ego development, secure attachment, and more adaptive interactions with mothers and best friends. longitudinal analyses supported a popularity-socialization hypothesis, however, in which popular adolescents were more likely to increase behaviors that receive approval in the peer group (e.g., minor levels of drug use and delinquency) and decrease behaviors unlikely to be well received by peers (e.g., hostile behavior with peers).
objective altered micrornas (mirnas) expression has been found in many cancer types, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (lscc). the aim of this study was to determine the role and clinical value of three lscc-related mirs, such as mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p in a homogeneous cohort of patients with primary lscc treated by primary surgery. methods expression levels of mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p were detected in 43 pairs of lscc and adjacent normal tissues by reverse-transcription quantitative pcr. overall survival and disease-free survival were evaluated using the kaplan–meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed using the cox proportional hazard analysis. results mir-21-5p is significantly upregulated, while mir-let-7a is significantly downregulated in lscc tumor tissues compared with the corresponding adjacent normal tissues. the downregulation of mir-34c-5p expression significantly correlated with a shorter disease-free survival and, in the multivariate analysis, low mir-34c-5p expression was associated with an increased risk of recurrence. conclusions mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p seem to play a critical role in lscc carcinogenesis and might have a diagnostic and prognostic clinical value. the mir-let-7a levels could have a predictive role for lymph node metastases and mir-34c-5p might be a promising biomarker of patient outcome. in this study, we report for the first time reduced expression of the let-7 microrna in human lung cancers. interestingly, 143 lung cancer cases that had undergone potentially curative resection could be classified into two major groups according to let-7 expression in unsupervised hierarchical analysis, showing significantly shorter survival after potentially curative resection in cases with reduced let-7 expression (p = 0.0003). multivariate cox regression analysis showed this prognostic impact to be independent of disease stage (hazard ratio = 2.17; p = 0.009). in addition, overexpression of let-7 in a549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line inhibited lung cancer cell growth in vitro. this study represents the first report of reduced expression of let-7 and the potential clinical and biological effects of such a microrna alteration.
a peptide designed to induce apoptosis of endothelium in white adipose tissue (wat) decreases adiposity. the goal of this work is to determine whether targeting of wat endothelium results in impaired glucose regulation as a result of impaired wat function. glucose tolerance tests were performed on days 2 and 3 of treatment with vehicle (hf-v) or proapoptotic peptide (hf-pp) and mice pair-fed to hf-pp (hf-pf) in obese mice on a high-fat diet (hfd). serum metabolic variables, including lipid profile, adipokines, individual fatty acids, and acylcarnitines, were measured. microarray analysis was performed in epididymal fat of lean or obese mice treated with vehicle or proapoptotic peptide (pp). pp rapidly and potently improved glucose tolerance of obese mice in a weight- and food intake–independent manner. serum insulin and triglycerides were decreased in hf-pp relative to hf-v. levels of fatty acids and acylcarnitines were distinctive in hf-pp compared with hf-v or hf-pf. microarray analysis in at revealed that pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, and branched-chain amino acid degradation were changed by exposure to hfd and were reversed by pp administration. these studies suggest a novel role of the at vasculature in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. obesity alters adipose tissue metabolic and endocrine function and leads to an increased release of fatty acids, hormones, and proinflammatory molecules that contribute to obesity associated complications. to further characterize the changes that occur in adipose tissue with increasing adiposity, we profiled transcript expression in perigonadal adipose tissue from groups of mice in which adiposity varied due to sex, diet, and the obesity-related mutations agouti (ay) and obese (lepob). we found that the expression of 1,304 transcripts correlated significantly with body mass. of the 100 most significantly correlated genes, 30% encoded proteins that are characteristic of macrophages and are positively correlated with body mass. immunohistochemical analysis of perigonadal, perirenal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous adipose tissue revealed that the percentage of cells expressing the macrophage marker f4/80 (f4/80+) was significantly and positively correlated with both adipocyte size and body mass. similar relationships were found in human subcutaneous adipose tissue stained for the macrophage antigen cd68. bone marrow transplant studies and quantitation of macrophage number in adipose tissue from macrophage-deficient (csf1op/op) mice suggest that these f4/80+ cells are csf-1 dependent, bone marrow-derived adipose tissue macrophages. expression analysis of macrophage and nonmacrophage cell populations isolated from adipose tissue demonstrates that adipose tissue macrophages are responsible for almost all adipose tissue tnf-alpha expression and significant amounts of inos and il-6 expression. adipose tissue macrophage numbers increase in obesity and participate in inflammatory pathways that are activated in adipose tissues of obese individuals.
this study describes the antichagasic potential of five compounds isolated from leaves of piper crassinervium (piperaceae). two prenylated benzoic acid derivatives, one prenylated hydroquinone and two flavanones, were evaluated. the in vitro trypanocidal activity was determined against epimastigote forms of trypanosoma cruzi (y strain), the etiologic agent of chagas disease. the most active compound was the prenylated hydroquinone [1,4-dihydroxy-2-(30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20-e,60-octadienyl)benzene] with an ic50 value of 6.10 µg ml−1, which was in the same order of activity if compared with the positive control benznidazole (ic50 = 1.60 µg ml−1). this is the first report of trypanocidal activity for prenylated hydroquinone and benzoic acid derivatives. the in vitro antiproliferative effects of 4 neolignans purified from the ethyl-acetate extract from leaves of piper regnellii (miq.) c. dc. var. pallescens (c. dc.) yunck against trypanosoma cruzi were investigated. these isolated compounds were identified through spectral analyses of uv, ei-ms, 1h-, 13c-nmr, h-h cosy, gnoe, hetcor, and hmbc. the compounds eupomatenoid-5, eupomatenoid-6, and conocarpan showed considerable activity against epimastigote forms of t. cruzi, with 50% inhibition concentrations (ic50) of 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 microg/ml respectively. after methylation, these compounds showed a lessened inhibitory activity to the growth of the protozoan, suggesting that loss of the hydroxyl group from their molecules reduces the activity. the compound eupomatenoid-3 showed lower activity than the hexane fraction. eupomatenoid-5 was significantly more active than benznidazole, the antiparasitic drug of choice for treatment of chagas' disease. the crude extract, hexane fraction, and eupomatenoid-5 caused no lysis in sheep blood at concentrations which inhibit the growth of epimastigote forms. the compound eupomatenoid-5 showed low cytotoxic effects against vero cells. these results provide new perspectives on the development of novel drugs obtained from natural products with trypanocidal activity. however, the extracts and active compound isolated from p. regnellii var. pallescens should be further studied in animal models for in vivo efficacy.
backgroudinterleukin-10(il-10) is a multifunctional cytokine with both immunosuppressive and antiangiogenic functions. polymorphisms in the il-10 gene promoter genetically determine interindividual differences in il-10 production. this study was performed to determined whether polymorphisms in the il-10 gene promoter were associated with breast cancer in a chinese han population.methodswe genotyped 315 patients with breast cancer and 322 healthy control subjects for -1082a/g, -819t/c and -592a/c single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the il-10 gene by polymerase chain reactionerestriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp).resultsthere were no significant differences in genotype, allele, or haplotype frequencies in all three loci between patients and healthy controls. analysis of breast cancer prognostic and predictive factors revealed that the -1082aa genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of lymph node (ln) involvement (p = 0.041) and larger tumor size (p = 0.039) at the time of diagnosis. furthermore, in the haplotype analysis of il-10 gene, we found that patients carrying ata haplotype were in higher ln involvement (p = 0.022) and higher tumor stage(p = 0.028) of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis compared with others.conclusionsour findings suggest that il-10 promoter polymorphisms participate in the progression of breast cancer rather than in its initial development in chinese han women. interleukin-10 (il-10) is an immunosuppressive cytokine which may facilitate development of cancer by supporting tumor escape from the immune response. a [tcata] haplotype formed by polymorphisms at positions −3575, −2763, −1082, −819 and −592 in the promoter of the il-10 gene is a strong determinant for il-10 expression. the presence of this haplotype can be determined by analysis of the −592c > a polymorphism. aim of the present study was to analyze the role of the il-10 [tcata] haplotype for breast cancer. we performed a case–control study including 500 female patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer and 500 female, age-matched, healthy control subjects from population-based screening studies. the −592c > a polymorphism was determined by a 5′-nuclease assay (taqman). frequency of the homozygous −592 aa genotype, indicating homozygosity for the [tcata] haplotype, was 4.2% among patients and 7.3% among controls (p=0.038; odds ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval 0.32–0.97). il-10 genotypes were not associated with tumor size, histological grading, estrogen or progesterone receptor status and age at diagnosis. therefore we conclude that the il-10 −592c > a promoter polymorphism may be associated with a reduced breast cancer risk.
summary the cues by which homing pigeons are able to return to a home loft after displacement to unfamiliar release sites remain debated. a number of experiments in which migratory birds have been treated with a magnetic pulse have produced a disruption in their orientation, which argues that a ferrimagnetic sense is used for navigation in birds. one previous experiment has also indicated an effect of magnetic pulses on homing pigeon navigation, although with inconsistent results. previous studies have shown that some magnetic-related information is transmitted by the trigeminal nerve to the brain in some bird species, including the homing pigeon. the function of this information is still unclear. it has been suggested that this information is important for navigation. previous studies with trigeminal nerve lesioned homing pigeons have clearly shown that the lack of trigeminally mediated information, even if magnetic, is not crucial for homing performance. however, this result does not completely exclude the possibility that other ferrimagnetic receptors in the homing pigeon play a role in navigation. additionally, recent studies on homing pigeons suggested the existence of a ferrimagnetic sense in a novel location presumably located in the inner ear (lagena). in the present study, we tested whether any ferrimagnetic magnetoreceptors, irrespective of their location in the bird's head, are involved in pigeons' homing. to do this, we treated homing pigeons with a strong magnetic pulse before release, tracked birds with gps loggers and analyzed whether this treatment affected homing performance. in the single previous magnetic pulse experiment on homing pigeons, only initial orientation at a release site was considered and the results were inconsistent. we observed no effect of the magnetic pulse at any of the sites used on initial orientation, homing performance, tortuosity or track efficiency, which does not support a role for the ferrimagnetic sense in homing pigeon navigation, at least not in this geographic area, where magnetic field variations are in the region of 200 nt intensity and 0.8 deg inclination. summary anatomical evidence and conditioning experiments have suggested that magnetoreceptors innervated by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve are located in the upper beak of homing pigeons. following these findings it has been proposed that the trigeminally-mediated magnetorececeptors are able to detect magnetic field intensity, which might be useful for a position finding mechanism for pigeons homing from unfamiliar locations. recent data have shown that, in inexperienced pigeons, section of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve does not impair navigational abilities. similarly, no impairment was observed if the trigeminal section was performed on young pigeons, before they have had the opportunity to learn a navigational map. by contrast, section of the olfactory nerve either in adult inexperienced pigeons or in young birds before map learning, disrupted their homing performance. nevertheless, because a magnetic map mechanism requires training flights for learning the magnetic gradient of the territory around the loft, the question remains as to whether the navigational performance of adult experienced pigeons can be affected by lack of magnetic information. to answer this question we extensively group-trained adult pigeons and then surgically deprived them of either olfactory or trigeminally mediated magnetic information, prior to testing their navigational abilities. the birds deprived of trigeminally mediated magnetic information displayed similar navigational abilities as intact control pigeons, whereas the olfactory-deprived pigeons were dramatically impaired in homing. our data show that even in trained adult pigeons, olfactory cues are needed for homing from unfamiliar locations and that the lack of magnetic information does not affect navigational abilities of experienced adult homing pigeons.
multiple fibroblast growth factor (fgf) axis alterations are known to occur in prostate cancer. here we simultaneously profiled key components of this axis to determine their relevance in disease progression. an optimized immunohistochemistry protocol was used in expression analysis of fgf2, fgf8, fgfr1, fgfr4, and sef (similar expression to fgf) in a single tma of prostate cancer. fgf ligands and receptors were overexpressed in cancers compared to benign samples (p < 0.0001), while sef expression was reduced (p < 0.0001). there was a positive association between higher grades and increased fgfr4 (p = 0.02), fgf2, and fgf8 (p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001). sef expression was progressively lower with increasing grade (p = 0.005). clinical stage was positively associated with fgf2, fgf8, and fgfr4 expression (p = 0.005, 0.03, and 0.012) but not with fgfr1 or sef expression. only reduced sef was associated with bone metastasis (p = 0.02) and was also predictive of subsequent metastasis in initially localized tumours (p = 0.004). down‐regulation of sef and increased fgfr4 were also the only independent variables associated with disease‐specific survival (hr 1.73, p = 0.04 and hr 0.56, p = 0.01). in in vitro studies, silencing sef enhanced the cell response to fgfs (p < 0.001) and substantially mitigated the effectiveness of an fgfr1 inhibitor. conversely, increased sef blocked the response to fgfs and had a comparable suppressive effect to the inhibitor. this study demonstrates that increased fgfr4 and reduced sef may be critical fgf alterations associated with prostate cancer progression. sef may also have a role in the tumour response to fgfr inhibition and warrants further investigation in this context. copyright © 2009 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd. fibroblast growth factors (fgf), and in particular fgf8, have been strongly implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. this study investigated the expression of sef, a key inhibitory regulator of fgf signalling, in prostate cancer. in a panel of cell lines, hsef was detected in both androgen-dependent and independent cells but was significantly reduced in highly metastatic derivative clones. hsef expression was not influenced by androgenic stimulation. forced downregulation of hsef by sirna increased fgf8b induced cell migration (p=0.02) and invasion (p=0.007). reduced hsef levels also enhanced fgf8b stimulated expression of mmp9 (p=0.005). mrna in situ hybridization revealed hsef expression in 80% (8/10) of benign biopsies but in only 69% (23/33) of gleason sum 4–7 and 35% (10/28) of gleason sum 8–10 cancer biopsies (p=0.004). quantitative pcr of microdissected glands confirmed this trend (p=0.001). hsef was expressed in 69% (27/39) of non-metastatic tumours but in only 18% (2/11) of metastatic tumours (p=0.004, n=50). hsef expression was next correlated with earlier data on fgf8b expression in a subgroup of cancers. in this cohort, 86% (19/22) of high-grade cancers expressed fgf8 but only 31% (7/22) expressed hsef. positive fgf8 expression but a loss of hsef was observed in 88% (7/8) of metastatic tumours. in contrast, metastasis was evident in only 10% (1/10) of tumours, which co-expressed both fgf8 and hsef (p<0.001). these results suggest evidence that hsef is downregulated in advanced prostate cancer and might facilitate an enhanced tumorigenic response to fgfs. further research into the role of hsef in cancer cell signalling and the mechanism of its downregulation may contribute to more effective targeting of growth factors in prostate cancer.
uses a known decryption process to recover the sender’s original message. if abstract: in this article, a new symmetric block cipher named msea is proposed. msea is based on arx cryptographic design technique. msea is simple in nature due to the use of combinations of elementary operations like modular addition, bit-wise rotation and bit-wise xor. in msea, plain text block, secret key, and number of encryption rounds are variable in size, while the size of cipher text is double of size of plain text. data-dependant rotation is the most vital feature of msea through which the unpredictability of encrypted text is increasing. key formation and encryption/decryption schemes of msea are significantly fast. a new secret-key block cipher is proposed as a candidate for a new encryption standard. in the proposed cipher, the plaintext and the ciphertext are 64 bit blocks, while the secret key is 128 bit long. the cipher is based on the design concept of "mixing operations from different algebraic groups". the cipher structure was chosen to provide confusion and diffusion and to facilitate both hardware and software implementations.
nowadays, modern biopsy techniques such as fine and wide needles are used instead of invasive biopsy techniques for examining malign and benign lesions. this study examines whether wide needle biopsy (tru-cut) possesses advantages as an alternative method to open biopsy. this study was performed on 40 patients with suspicious intra-jaw lesions. an 18-gauge, three-piece biopsy device was used. all the samples were sent to the tumor pathology unit at the oncology institute for histopathologic and cytopathologic examination. thirty-seven of the 40 samples were adequate for diagnosis and three inadequate were. when we considered the results of tru-cut and fine needle biopsy, the diagnostic value increased to 62.5%. in each lesion, the success rate of open biopsy is 92.5%, the success rate of tru-cut biopsy is 55% and that of fine needle biopsy is 42.5%. according to our results, if we can support the study of this technique with new studies and can improve the specific apparatus for the maxillo-facial region, this can be a good alternative technique for open biopsy applications. aspiration biopsy of bone is a simple and relatively safe diagnostic tool that had a diagnostic accuracy of 72 per cent in thirty-one patients who had a primary bone tumor that was suspected of being malignant and of 83 per cent in twelve patients who had a suspected giant-cell tumor. however, twenty-six primary lesions of bone that were thought likely to be benign were not as easily and definitively diagnosed (an accuracy rate of 23 per cent), and for these lesions, multiple needle-aspiration samples or open biopsy provides greater diagnostic accuracy.
prostate tumor overexpressed 1 was recently identified as a novel gene and protein during a differential display screening for genes overexpressed in prostate cancer. it has been suggested that overexpression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 can contribute to the proliferative status of prostate tumor cells and, thus, to their biologic behavior. prostate tumor overexpressed 1 and ki-67 were immunohistochemically evaluated in prostate cancer, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal-looking epithelium in 20 cystoprostatectomies and 20 radical prostatectomies with pt2a gleason score 6 prostate cancer. the aim was to see whether there were differences in marker expression between cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies. the proportions of prostate tumor overexpressed 1- and ki-67-positive cells in the cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies increased from normal-looking epithelium through high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, away from and adjacent to prostate cancer, to prostate cancer. prostate tumor overexpressed 1 expression in prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomies was lower than in radical prostatectomies, the differences being significant; there were significant differences in ki-67 indices. in conclusion, our findings related to prostate tumor overexpressed 1 expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, evaluated adjacent and away from prostate cancer, and in incidental and clinical cancers give further support to the concept of field effect in prostatic carcinogenesis as well as to differences in the process of prostatic carcinogenesis between cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies. diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is usually not difficult in biopsy specimens. problems may occur in biopsy specimens, containing only a few suspicious lesions. recently, p504s has been tested as a new marker for prostatic carcinoma. when over-expressed in atypical glands without basal cells, it establishes the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma. we analysed the staining intensity of p504s in 208 biopsy specimens from prostates (1) with adenocarcinoma (n=132), (2) with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (hgpin) with adenocarcinoma (n=36), (3) with hgpin alone (n=40) and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to (n=54) or distant from adenocarcinoma (n=64). p504s expression was negative to weakly positive in biopsy specimens showing hgpin without carcinoma and weakly positive in radical prostatectomy specimens revealing hgpin distant from adenocarcinoma. in biopsy specimens with a combination of hgpin and adenocarcinoma and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to adenocarcinoma, p504s was strongly expressed. the same findings were made in radical prostatectomy specimens containing adenocarcinoma and hgpin adjacent to or distant from adenocarcinoma and in preoperative biopsies revealing adenocarcinoma and hgpin. these results suggest that moderate to strong p504s expression in hgpin of biopsy specimens is indicative of an associated adenocarcinoma and may be helpful in the choice of therapy.
human sperm nucleoproteins consist of protamines and histones. changes in composition of these proteins are thought to correlate with spermatogenesis and may be involved in some instances of male infertility. we sought to separate sperm nucleoproteins including variants of protamine using an improved two-dimensional electrophoretic method, with the aim of comprehensively analysing all sperm nucleoprotein constituents. after extracting nuclear basic proteins from the sperm of normal volunteers, we analysed these proteins on a gel sheet by a radical free, highly reducing method based on kaltschmidt and whittmann's two-dimensional electrophoresis. basic proteins from sperm nuclei were separated clearly into 12 spots. by amino acid sequence analysis, these spots corresponded to protamine 1 (p1)- (five spots), protamine 2 (p2)-related proteins (six spots) and testis-specific histone h2b (one spot). the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the six p2-related proteins were compatible with those of hpi1, hpi2, hps1, hps2, hp2 and hp3, and quantitative comparison could be performed. in conclusion, human sperm nucleoproteins including all p2-related variants could be analysed quantitatively with high resolution on a single electrophoretic gel. the dna in human sperm chromatin is packaged into nucleoprotamine (approximately 85%) and nucleohistone (approximately 15%). whether these two chromatin fractions are sequence-specific subsets of the spermatozoon genome is the question addressed in this report. sequence-specific packaging would suggest distinct structural and functional roles for the nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine in late spermatogenesis or early development or both. after removal of histones with 0.65m nacl, exposed dna was cleaved with bam hi restriction endonuclease and separated by centrifugation from insoluble nucleoprotamine. the dna sequence distribution of nucleohistone dna in the supernatant and nucleoprotamine dna in the pellet was compared by cloning size-selected single-copy sequences and by using the derived clones as probes of nucleohistone dna and nucleoprotamine dna. two clones derived from nucleohistone dna preferentially hybridized to nucleohistone dna, and two clones derived from nucleoprotamine dna preferentially hybridized to nucleoprotamine dna, which demonstrated the existence of sequence-specific nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine components within the human spermatozoon.
the association between cyclin d1 (ccnd1) rs9344 g>a (g870a) polymorphism and gastric cancer (gc) has been extensively investigated; however, the results remain conflicting. in the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to further address this issue. we carried out a meta-analysis, recruiting seven publications with 1,350 gc cases and 1,823 controls, to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation between the ccnd1 rs9344 g>a polymorphism and the susceptibility of gastric cancer. after combining all eligible studies, we found null association between ccnd1 rs9344 g>a polymorphism and gc in all genetic models. in a stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant decreases in gc risk were observed for caucasians in one genetic model: aa vs. ga+gg (or, 0.65; 95% ci, 0.44-0.96; p = 0.032). begg’s funnel plots and egger’s tests were created to measure the publication bias, and the shape of funnel was symmetry in four genetic models, suggesting the stability of our findings. the results highlight that ccnd1 rs9344 g>a variants may be associated with the risk of gastric cancer among caucasians. objective. cyclin d1 (ccnd1) is a regulatory protein involved in the cell cycle of both normal and neoplastic cells. polymorphism of this gene at codon 242 in exon 4 (a870g) has an impact on the risk of several human cancers. the purpose of this study was to study the relation between the ccnd1 a870g gene polymorphism and the risk of non-cardiac gastric cancer in a chinese population. material and methods. the study population consisted of 159 patients with non-cardiac gastric cancer and 162 cancer-free controls. ccnd1 870a/g polymorphism was genotyped by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assay and sequencing. results. ccnd1 genotype distribution among the patients was significantly different from that among controls; aa (odds ratio (or)=0.348, 95% ci: 0.163–0.742) and ga (or=0.715, 95% ci: 0.506–1.012) genotypes were significantly lower in the gastric cancer patients than in the controls when subjects with the gg genotype served as the reference category. in other words, the risk of gastric cancer for subjects with the gg genotype was 2.8 times that of subjects with the aa genotype, and 1.4 times that of subjects with the ga genotype. furthermore, in the stratification analyses, the risk of gg genotype was more evident in subjects ≥60 years of age and those positive for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection. conclusions. the ccnd1870 gg genotype is associated with an increased risk for non-cardiac gastric cancer in patients in a high-risk area of china. larger studies with multiple polymorphisms are needed to verify this finding and the function of this polymorphism needs to be further investigated.
the objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of using electromyographic biofeedback in the early stages of rehabilitation after meniscal repair. in this randomised, controlled, parallel group study, the evolution of patients with meniscal lesions treated by meniscal suture who received (study group, n = 33) or did not receive (control group, n = 31) electromyographic biofeedback as part of their early rehabilitation programme has been compared. a total of 64 patients with previous meniscal repair participated in the study. the patients received a baseline assessment (after 1 postoperative week) and a follow-up (after 8 postoperative weeks) consisting of surface electromyography, dynamometry of thigh muscles and the assessment of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (koos). the electrical potential in contraction and the speed for contraction and relaxation for all monitored muscles increased significantly in the study group (p < 0.05). the difference between groups in the assessed score was significant for sport and recreational function (p < 0.05). the strength of the thigh muscles was not significantly influenced by the introduction of electromyographic biofeedback (emg- bfb) in the rehabilitation programme. electromyographic biofeedback helped patients to control their muscles after meniscal repair to accomplish physical activities that require better neuromuscular coordination and control. for these reasons, one may consider electromyographic biofeedback as an important component of rehabilitation after meniscal repair. key pointsexercises during the early phases of rehabilitation after meniscal repair are difficult to perform because of pain, oedema, and possibly a disruption in normal joint receptor activity.electromyographic biofeedback is a painless, non-invasive method that can be used in muscle recovery after meniscal repair and enhances the rehabilitation process, especially related to muscular function.the rehabilitation programme that includes electromyographic biofeedback after meniscal repair increased the speed of muscle response to acoustic stimulation in both the initiation of contraction (onset time) and relaxation (offset time) and, also, the capacity of performing some specific physical acti-vities after 8 weeks of rehabilitation (according to koos values).electromyographic biofeedback is not responsible for the decrease in pain, swelling or other postoperative symptoms but it is important in order to help the patient to conduct the activities which require neuromuscular coordination and muscle control. the patient with meniscal injury may present with pain, swelling, or mechanical symptoms and often requires surgical intervention for symptom resolution. treatment of such injuries relies on understanding the gross and microanatomic features of the meniscus that are important in maintaining meniscal function. the ability of the meniscus to participate in load bearing, shock absorption, joint lubrication, and joint stability depends on the maintenance of its structural integrity. the diagnosis of meniscal injury often can be made by clinical evaluation utilizing the history, physical examination, and plain radiographs. magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in confirming the diagnosis when clinical findings are inconclusive. treatment depends on tear pattern, vascularity, and an assessment of tissue quality. surgical decision making for the treatment of meniscal injury is based on patient factors and understanding of the meniscal structure, function, and pathology.
although a number of recent studies have examined functional connectivity at rest, few have assessed differences between connectivity both during rest and across active task paradigms. therefore, the question of whether cortical connectivity patterns remain stable or change with task engagement continues to be unaddressed. we collected multi-scan fmri data on healthy controls (n=53) and schizophrenia patients (n=42) during rest and across paradigms arranged hierarchically by sensory load. we measured functional network connectivity among 45 non-artifactual distinct brain networks. then, we applied a novel analysis to assess cross paradigm connectivity patterns applied to healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. to detect these patterns, we fit a group by task full factorial anova model to the group average functional network connectivity values. our approach identified both stable (static effects) and state-based differences (dynamic effects) in brain connectivity providing a better understanding of how individuals' reactions to simple sensory stimuli are conditioned by the context within which they are presented. our findings suggest that not all group differences observed during rest are detectable in other cognitive states. in addition, the stable differences of heightened connectivity between multiple brain areas with thalamus across tasks underscore the importance of the thalamus as a gateway to sensory input and provide new insight into schizophrenia. a growing number of studies have reported altered functional connectivity in schizophrenia during putatively “task-free” states and during the performance of cognitive tasks. however, there have been few systematic examinations of functional connectivity in schizophrenia across rest and different task states to assess the degree to which altered functional connectivity reflects a stable characteristic or whether connectivity changes vary as a function of task demands. we assessed functional connectivity during rest and during three working memory loads of an n-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) among: (1) individuals with schizophrenia (n = 19); (2) the siblings of individuals with schizophrenia (n = 28); (3) healthy controls (n = 10); and (4) the siblings of healthy controls (n = 17). we examined connectivity within and between four brain networks: (1) frontal–parietal (fp); (2) cingulo-opercular (co); (3) cerebellar (cer); and (4) default mode (dmn). in terms of within-network connectivity, we found that connectivity within the dmn and fp increased significantly between resting state and 0-back, while connectivity within the co and cer decreased significantly between resting state and 0-back. additionally, we found that connectivity within both the dmn and fp was further modulated by memory load. in terms of between network connectivity, we found that the dmn became significantly more “anti-correlated” with the fp, co, and cer networks during 0-back as compared to rest, and that connectivity between the fp and both co and cer networks increased with memory load. individuals with schizophrenia and their siblings showed consistent reductions in connectivity between both the fp and co networks with the cer network, a finding that was similar in magnitude across rest and all levels of working memory load. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered functional connectivity in schizophrenia reflects a stable characteristic that is present across cognitive states.
for cross-pollination trees, the optimal breeding method is hybridization. tree heterosis is commonly present and is the main research focus in tree crossbreeding. salt stress and interspecific hybridization may lead to dna methylation changes. the study crossed fraxinus mandshurica (female parent) with fraxinus velutina (male parent) to obtain interspecific f1 hybrid progenies that could obtain the good characters of parents. the results showed that growth and survival rate of the interspecific hybrid progenies (f1 hybrids of f. mandshurica × f. velutina) were significantly higher than those of intraspecific open pollinated plants from parental f. mandshurica and f. velutina. salt tolerance and cytosine methylation in interspecific f1 hybrids and the intraspecific open pollinated plants from parents were examined. membrane permeability, ros and antioxidant activity, malondialdehyde, and photosynthesis were measured after salt treatment and genomic methylation was analyzed using a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism protocol. f1 hybrids exhibited heterosis for growth in normal as well as high salt conditions. dna methylation in the f1 hybrids was lower than the intraspecific open pollinated plants from parents. salt treatments changed dna methylation patterns in f1 hybrids. genomic dna of the intraspecific open pollinated plants from parents had internal cytosine methylation (average of 13.22 %), whereas f1 hybrid seedlings had external cytosine methylation (average of 7.34 %). such changes in dna methylation patterns in f1 hybrids suggest a connection between salt tolerance and epigenetic mechanisms in plants. we observed that alteration of dna methylation was closely correlated with the adaptation to the salt stress and provided epigenetic mechanisms of salt tolerance in the interspecific hybridization of trees. abstract dna methylation is known to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. in this study, we assessed the extent and pattern of cytosine methylation in the rice genome, using the technique of methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (msap), which is a modification of the amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) method that makes use of the differential sensitivity of a pair of isoschizomers to cytosine methylation. the tissues assayed included seedlings and flag leaves of an elite rice hybrid, shanyou 63, and the parental lines zhenshan 97 and minghui 63. in all, 1076 fragments, each representing a recognition site cleaved by either or both of the isoschizomers, were amplified using 16 pairs of selective primers. a total of 195 sites were found to be methylated at cytosines in one or both parents, and the two parents showed approximately the same overall degree of methylation (16.3%), as revealed by the incidence of differential digestion by the isoschizomers. four classes of patterns were identified in a comparative assay of cytosine methylation in the parents and hybrid; increased methylation was detected in the hybrid compared to the parents at some of the recognition sites, while decreased methylation in the hybrid was detected at other sites. a small proportion of the sites was found to be differentially methylated in seedlings and flag leaves; dna from young seedlings was methylated to a greater extent than that from flag leaves. almost all of the methylation patterns detected by msap could be confirmed by southern analysis using the isolated amplified fragments as probes. the results clearly demonstrate that the msap technique is highly efficient for large-scale detection of cytosine methylation in the rice genome. we believe that the technique can be adapted for use in other plant species.
hiv-1 latency represents a major problem in the eradication of hiv-1 in infected individuals treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy. histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibits hiv-1 gene expression and virus production and may contribute to quiescence of hiv-1 within resting cd4+ t cells. here, we evaluated the effect of oxamflatin, a class i hdac inhibitor, on the epigenetic change at hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) and the induction of the latent viruses in the latency jurkat t cell line. flow cytometry assay showed that oxamflatin activate hiv-1 gene expression in these latently infected cells by 2–17 fold than background levels. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays further revealed that oxamflatin increase the acetylation level of histone h3 and histone h4 at the nucleosome 1(nuc-1) site of the hiv-1 ltr compared to mock treatment. we also found that oxamflatin had a synergization with prostratin, or 5-azacytidine or tumor necrosis factor-α to activate the hiv-1 promoter. taken together, our results suggest that the histone acetylation plays an important role in regulating hiv-1 ltr gene expression, and oxamflatin has potential as drug candidates as antilatency therapies. the persistence of transcriptionally silent but replication-competent hiv-1 reservoirs in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart)-treated infected individuals, represents a major hurdle to virus eradication. activation of hiv-1 gene expression in these cells together with an efficient haart has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy aimed at decreasing the pool of latent viral reservoirs. using the latently-infected u1 monocytic cell line and latently-infected j-lat t-cell clones, we here demonstrated a strong synergistic activation of hiv-1 production by clinically used histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis) combined with prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting nuclear factor (nf)- κb inducer. in j-lat cells, we showed that this synergism was due, at least partially, to the synergistic recruitment of unresponsive cells into the expressing cell population. a combination of prostratin+hdaci synergistically activated the 5′ long terminal repeat (5'ltr) from hiv-1 major group subtypes representing the most prevalent viral genetic forms, as shown by transient transfection reporter assays. mechanistically, hdacis increased prostratin-induced dna-binding activity of nuclear nf-κb and degradation of cytoplasmic nf-κb inhibitor, iκbα . moreover, the combined treatment prostratin+hdaci caused a more pronounced nucleosomal remodeling in the u1 viral promoter region than the treatments with the compounds alone. this more pronounced remodeling correlated with a synergistic reactivation of hiv-1 transcription following the combined treatment prostratin+hdaci, as demonstrated by measuring recruitment of rna polymerase ii to the 5'ltr and both initiated and elongated transcripts. the physiological relevance of the prostratin+hdaci synergism was shown in cd8+-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from haart-treated patients with undetectable viral load. moreover, this combined treatment reactivated viral replication in resting cd4+ t cells isolated from similar patients. our results suggest that combinations of different kinds of proviral activators may have important implications for reducing the size of latent hiv-1 reservoirs in haart-treated patients.
pharmaceutical grade trypsin is in ever-increasing demand for medical and industrial applications. improving the efficiency of existing biotechnological manufacturing processes is therefore paramount. when produced biotechnologically, trypsinogen—the inactive precursor of trypsin—is advantageous, since active trypsin would impair cell viability. to study factors affecting cell physiology and the production of trypsinogen in fed-batch cultures, we built a fusion protein of porcine trypsinogen and enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) in pichia pastoris. the experiments were performed with two different ph values (5.0 and 5.9) and two constant specific growth rates (0.02 and 0.04 1/h), maintained using exponential addition of methanol. all the productivity data presented rely on an active determination of trypsin obtained by proteolysis of the trypsinogen produced. the ph of the medium did not affect cell growth, but significantly influenced specific production of trypsinogen: a 1.7-fold higher concentration of trypsinogen was achieved at ph 5.9 (64 mg/l at 0.02 1/h) compared to ph 5.0. egfp was primarily used to facilitate detection of intracellular protein over the biosynthetic time course. using flow cytometry with fluorescence detection, cell disruption was avoided, and protein extraction and purification prior to analysis were unnecessary. however, western blot and sds-page showed that cleavage of egfp-trypsinogen fusion protein occurred, probably caused by pichia-endogenous proteases. the fluorescence analysis did therefore not accurately represent the actual trypsinogen concentration. however, we gained new experimentally-relevant insights, which can be used to avoid misinterpretation of tracking and quantifying as well as online-monitoring of proteins with the frequently used fluorescent tags. the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promoter and the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor prepro secretion signal were used to drive expression and secretion of a mucin-type fusion protein by pichia pastoris in 1 l scale bioreactors. the aim of the study was to understand how varying expression rates influenced the secretion dynamics of the fusion protein in terms of intracellular- and extracellular concentrations. endoplasmic reticulum (er) folding stress was assessed by the relative expression of the unfolded protein response controlled kar2 gene. three predefined methanol feeding models were applied to control the fusion protein synthesis rate. to track the fusion protein synthesis in a non-invasive manner and to follow its intracellular distribution, its c-terminal was linked to the green fluorescent protein. under all conditions the fusion protein was found to partially accumulate intracellularly, where the major fraction was an insoluble, fluorescent full-sized protein. the high degree of glycosylation of the insoluble fusion protein indicated a secretory bottle-neck in the golgi-system. this result was consistent with low er folding stress as quantified by the relative expression of the kar2 gene. reduction of recombinant protein synthesis rate, by using lower feed rates of methanol, enhanced extracellular concentrations from 8 to 18 mg·l–1 and reduced the rate of intracellular accumulation. this clearly demonstrates the importance of tuning the synthesis rate with secretory bottle-necks to maintain secretion.
the study investigated the effect of selection cues in working memory (wm) on the fate of not-selected contents of wm. experiments 1a and 1b showed that focusing on 1 cued item in wm does not impair memory for the remaining items. the nonfocused items are maintained in wm even when this is not required by the task. experiments 2 and 3 showed that items that were once focused in wm remain strengthened after the focus shifts away from them. when defocused items are presented as mismatching recognition probes, they are rejected better than other mismatching probes (experiments 2 and 3). when a defocused item was later cued again, such that the focus had to shift back to it, that item was recognized better than an item cued for the first time (experiment 3). the results support the distinction between mechanisms for temporary maintenance and the focus of attention in wm, and they challenge theories that explain maintenance and focusing by the same mechanisms, such as a limited number of slots or a limited resource. normal people have a strikingly low ability to detect changes in a visual scene. this has been taken as evidence that the brain represents only a few objects at a time, namely those currently in the focus of attention. in the present study, subjects were asked to detect changes in the orientation of rectangular figures in a textured display across a 1600 ms gray interval. in the first experiment, change detection improved when the location of a possible change was cued during the interval. the cue remained effective during the entire interval, but after the interval, it was ineffective, suggesting that an initially large representation was overwritten by the post-change display. to control for an effect of light intensity during the interval on the decay of the representation, we compared performance with a gray or a white interval screen in a second experiment. we found no difference between these conditions. in the third experiment, attention was occasionally misdirected during the interval by first cueing the wrong figure, before cueing the correct figure. this did not compromise performance compared to a single cue, indicating that when an item is attentionally selected, the representation of yet unchosen items remains available. in the fourth experiment, the cue was shown to be effective when changes in figure size and orientation were randomly mixed. at the time the cue appeared, subjects could not know whether size or orientation would change, therefore these results suggest that the representation contains features in their 'bound' state. together, these findings indicate that change blindness involves overwriting of a large capacity representation by the post-change display.
objective recent literature has suggested that trauma is heterogenic and that physiological response to it differs between sexes. the study represented in this manuscript aimed to describe gender differences in the mortality rates of trauma patients at the puerto rico trauma hospital (prth).   materials and methods this was a cross-sectional study performed at prth. a total of 14,874 injured patients admitted to the hospital from 2002 to 2011 were included in the sample and divided into 2 groups, based on sex. pearson's chi-square test was employed for categorical variables and the mann-whitney u test for continuous ones. a logistic regression model was undertaken to estimate the association between gender and study outcomes, after adjusting for confounders. a p-value lower than 0.05 was an indication of statistical significance. irb approval was received.   results the most common injury areas for women were the chest (32.50%), followed by the extremities (25.83%) and the head/neck (21.51%). road traffic collisions (rtcs) (45.08%), falls (19.62%), and pedestrian accidents (16.08%) were the most common injury mechanisms for women. the highest frequency of rtc injuries (57.52%) among females occurred in patients who were from 18 to 39 years old. females 65 years old and older exhibited the highest frequency of falls (39.78%) and pedestrian injuries (25.14%). males 17 years and under were more likely to have an injury severity score (iss) of 15 or greater (aor = 1.56; 95% ci: 1.19-2.03) than were their female counterparts; and, overall, males were more likely to have a glasgow coma score (gcs) under 9 (aor = 1.30; 95% ci: 1.11-1.53) than females were. despite these results, there were no differences between gender mortality rates (aor = 1.04; 95% ci: 0.86-1.25).   conclusion our results suggest that there is no sex dimorphism conferring protection on females. future studies should be conducted to assess this issue. background:  gender modifies immunologic responses caused by severe trauma or critical illness. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gender on hospital mortality, length of intensive care unit (icu) stay, and intensity of care of patients treated in icus.
to examine the role of the low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor on minor group human rhinovirus (rv) infection, primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells were infected with a minor group (rv2) or a major group (rv14) rv. viral infection was confirmed by showing with pcr that viral titers in supernatants and lysates from infected cells increased with time. rv2 and rv14 increased expression of mrna and protein of the ldl receptor on the cells and the cytokine production. rv2 induced activation of transcription factors sp1 and nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab). an antibody to the ldl receptor inhibited rv2 infection and rv2-induced cytokine production without an effect on rv14 infection and rv14-induced cytokine production. these findings imply that rv2 upregulates ldl receptor expression on airway epithelial cells, thereby increasing susceptibility to minor group rv infection. ldl receptor expression and cytokine production may be mediated, in part, via activation of transcription factors by rv2. these events may be important in airway inflammation after minor group rv infection in asthma. we have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) enhances expression of interleukin-6, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor genes in human omental microvascular endothelial (home) cells in culture. in this study, we found that treatment of home cells with tnf-alpha or interleukin-1 (il-1) caused enhanced expression of low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor. a few-fold increase in both ldl binding activity and the receptor mrna levels was observed when home cells were treated with either tnf-alpha or il-1. northern blot analysis showed that cellular expression of ldl receptor gene was significantly increased 12-24 h after exposure to tnf-alpha. no significant changes in the life-span of ldl receptor mrna were observed in untreated and tnf-alpha-treated cells. scatchard analysis showed an increased receptor number for ldl in tnf-alpha-treated cells. parallel to increased ldl binding activity, internalization and degradation of ldl were also increased in home cells treated with tnf-alpha or il-1. tnf-alpha-induced enhancement of ldl receptor gene expression was not observed when cycloheximide was present. cellular mrna level of sp-1 gene was increased about 3-4-fold at 12 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription of ldl receptor gene as well as sp-1 gene by tnf-alpha. gel retardation assay with the sp-1 consensus fragment showed that sp-1 binding activity was increased about 4-5-fold 12-24 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nf-kb binding activity was also dramatically increased, but there is no nf-kb motif on the promoter for ldl receptor gene. the induction of ldl receptor by tnf might be mediated through a transcription factor, sp-1.
immune thrombocytopenia (itp) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by anti-platelet autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. antigen-presenting cell (apc) dysfunction is considered to play crucial roles in itp. however, how apc affects autoreactive b cells in itp is still unknown. using a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenia, we demonstrated an increase in levels of tlr7 in splenic mononuclear cells (smcs). using both tlr7 agonist and tlr7 silencing lentivirus, we found stimulation of tlr7 decreased platelet counts and increased levels of platelet-associated igg (paigg) in itp mice, which correlates tlr7 with platelet destruction by autoantibodies. levels of serum baff increased significantly in itp mice and stimulation of tlr7 promoted secretion of baff. among the three baff receptors, only baff receptor (baff-r) increased in itp mice. however, activation of tlr7 showed no effect on the expression of baff receptors. these findings indicate that upregulation of tlr7 may augment baff secretion by apc and through ligation of baff-r promote autoreactive b cell survival and thus anti-platelet autoantibody production. the pathway of tlr7/baff/baff-r provides us with an explanation of how activation of apc affects autoantibody production by b cells in itp and thus might provide a reasonable therapeutic strategy for itp. increased levels of b lymphocyte stimulator (blys) are associated with systemic autoimmunity in animal models of spontaneous autoimmune disease, and transgenic animals expressing blys develop typical autoimmune disease. here, we demonstrate significant elevations of blys in the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). the blys isolated from the sera of sle patients had the same m.w. as the natural soluble form and was able to stimulate b cell activation in vitro. increased blys in sle patients was partially associated with higher levels of anti-dsdna ab of the igg, igm, and iga classes, but not associated with the disease activity. our results suggest that blys may be a useful marker for early activation of an autoimmune diathesis and likely plays a critical role in triggering activation of self-ag-driven autoimmune b cells in human sle. blys may provide an effective therapeutic target in systemic autoimmunity.
background and aimsan understanding of the root traits in overcoming the constraints to canola growth imposed by heat and drought stresses is increasingly needed. this research examines the feasibility of using an electrical measurement method to screen canola root traits and its response to heat and drought stresses.methodstwo genotypes were assessed under two temperature regimes (normal: 23/17 °c, vs. high: 27/24 °c, day/night) combined with three water levels in a controlled environment. all pots were subjected to root electrical capacitance (ec) and impedance (ei) measurements, followed by root morphological evaluation using a destructive method.resultsboth heat and drought stresses suppressed root morphological parameters significantly, accompanied with a decreasing ec and increasing ei. both 1 khz and 10 khz are acceptable current frequencies for effective measurement of ec and ei. a linear correlation was found between ec and most root parameters for canola plants grown in soil.conclusionsthis research illustrates the feasibility of using ec measurements to assess root morphological parameters of canola plants grown in soil. it is possible to apply this non–destructive method for studying the dynamics of roots subjected to abiotic stress. high ec can be associated with tolerance to heat and drought stresses. analysis of plant root systems is difficult under field conditions, especially root systems of adult trees, which are large and complex and include fine absorbing roots as well as conducting coarse roots. although coarse roots can be visualized by several methods, there are technical difficulties with root quantification. the method presented here focuses on the quantification of absorbing root surfaces through an electrical (the modified earth impedance) method. it is based on the experimentally verified fact that an applied electric current flows from the roots to the soil (or vice versa) through the same interfacial areas and predominantly in the same way as water (water solution of minerals or nutrients) flows from the soil to the tree. based on the different conductivities of tree tissues and soil, the interfacial area, which represents the absorbing root surfaces (or root absorption zones), can be calculated. only the theoretical description of the method is presented in this paper: the experimental verification of the method under field conditions is presented in the accompanying paper.
backgroundthe anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (apc/c) is the largest member of the ubiquitin ligase [e3] family. it plays a crucial role in the control of the cell cycle and cell proliferation by mediating the proteolysis of key components by the proteasome. apc/c is made of a dozen subunits that assemble into a large complex of ~1.5 mda, which interacts with various cofactors and targets.resultsusing comparative genomic and phylogenetic approaches, we showed that 24 out of 37 known apc/c subunits, adaptors/co-activators and main targets, were already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (leca) and were well conserved to a few exceptions in all present-day eukaryotic lineages. the phylogenetic analysis of the 24 components inferred to be present in leca showed that they contain a reliable phylogenetic signal to reconstruct the phylogeny of the domain eucarya.conclusionstaken together our analyses indicated that leca had a complex and highly controlled modern-like cell cycle. moreover, we showed that, despite what is generally assumed, proteins involved in housekeeping cellular functions may be a good complement to informational genes to study the phylogeny of eukaryotes. abstract. molecular phylogenetic analyses have recently shown that the unicellular amoeboid protist capsaspora owczarzaki is unlikely to be a nucleariid or an ichthyosporean as previously described, but is more closely related to metazoa, choanoflagellata, and ichthyosporea. however, the specific phylogenetic relationship of capsaspora to other protist opisthokont lineages was poorly resolved. to test these earlier results we have expanded both the taxonomic sampling and the number of genes from opisthokont unicellular lineages. we have sequenced the protein‐coding genes elongation factor 1‐α (ef1‐α) and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) from c. owczarzaki and the ichthyosporean sphaeroforma arctica. our maximum likelihood (ml) and bayesian analyses of a concatenated alignment of ef1‐α, hsp70, and actin protein sequences with a better sampling of opisthokont‐related protist lineages indicate that c. owczarzaki is not clearly allied with any of the unicellular opisthokonts, but represents an independent unicellular lineage closely related to animals and choanoflagellates. moreover, we have found that the ichthyosporean s. arctica possesses an ef‐like (efl) gene copy instead of the canonical ef1‐α, the first so far described in an ichthyosporean. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis shows that the ef‐like gene of s. arctica strongly groups with the ef‐like genes from choanoflagellates. finally, to begin characterizing the capsaspora genome, we have performed pulsed‐field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analyses, which indicate that its genome has at least 12 chromosomes with a total genome size in the range of 22–25 mb.
changes in snow cover might influence arctic ecosystems to the same extent as increased temperatures. although the duration of snow cover is generally expected to decrease in the future as a result of global warming, the amounts of snow might increase in arctic areas where much of the elevated precipitation will fall as snow. we examined the effects of an increased snow cover, as a result of a snow fence treatment, on soil nitrogen mineralization, plant phenology, plant chemistry (nitrogen and potential defense compounds), the level of invertebrate herbivory, and performance of invertebrate herbivores in an arctic ecosystem, using dwarf birch (betula nana) and the autumnal moth (epirrita autumnata) as study organisms. an enhanced and prolonged snow cover increased the level of herbivory on dwarf birch leaves. larvae feeding on plants that had experienced enhanced snow cover grew faster and pupated earlier than larvae fed with plant material from control plots, indicating that plants from enhanced snow-lie plots produce higher-quality food to herbivores. the increased larval growth rate was strongly correlated with higher leaf nitrogen concentration in plants subjected to snow manipulation, and also to certain phenolic acids. snow manipulation did not change net nitrogen mineralization rates in the soil or total carbon concentration in leaves, but it altered the within-season fluctuating pattern of leaf phenolic compounds. this study demonstrates a positive relationship between increased snow cover and level of herbivory on deciduous shrubs, thus proposing a negative feedback on the climate-induced dwarf shrub expansion in arctic areas. insect damage changes plant physiology and chemistry, and such changes may influence the performance of herbivores. we introduced larvae of the autumnal moth (epirrita autumnataborkh.) on individual branches of its main host plant, mountain birch (betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (orlova) hämet-ahti) to examine rapid-induced plant responses, which may affect subsequent larval development. we measured systemic responses to herbivory by analyzing chemistry, photosynthesis, and leaf growth, as well as effects on larval growth and feeding, in undamaged branches of damaged and control trees. larvae reared on leaves from intact branches of the herbivore-damaged trees grew faster than those reared on leaves of control trees, indicating systemic-induced susceptibility. herbivore damage did not lead to systemic changes in levels of primary nutrients or phenolic compounds. the analyses of photosynthetic activity and individual hydrolyzable tannins revealed a reversal of leaf physiology-herbivore defense patterns. on control trees, consumption by e. autumnata larvae was positively correlated with photosynthetic activity; on damaged trees, this correlation was reversed, with consumption being negatively correlated with photosynthetic activity. a similar pattern was found in the relationship between monogalloylglucose, the most abundant hydrolyzable tannin of mountain birch, and leaf consumption. among the control trees, consumption was positively correlated with concentrations of monogalloylglucose, whereas among herbivore-damaged trees, this correlation was reversed and became negative. our results suggest that herbivore performance is related to both concentrations of phenolic compounds and photosynthetic activity in leaves. this linkage between herbivore performance, leaf chemistry, and physiology was sensitive to induced plant responses caused by slight herbivore damage.
it is well established that certain stress proteins or molecular chaperones are highly efficient in cross-presenting tumor-derived antigens, resulting in a potent antitumor immune response. in this study we demonstrate that genetic modification of weakly immunogenic murine prostate tumor cells (tramp-c2) by stable transfection with a secretable form of endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone grp170 significantly enhances its immunogenicity in vivo. generation of systemic antitumor immunity is indicated by the growth suppression of distant parental tumors, which is associated with increased tumor infiltration, elevated effector functions of cd8+ t-cells. immunization with inactivated grp170-secreting c2 cells augments a cd8+ t-cell dependent, tumor-protective effect. furthermore, infection of c2 tumor cells with a nonreplicating adenoviral vectors encoding secretable grp170 promotes tumor immunogenicity more effectively than plasmid transduction, as shown by the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α by dendritice cells and enhanced therapeutic efficacy in treating pre-established tumors. given a repertoire of undefined antigens in prostate tumor, manipulation of cellular compartmentalization of immuno-stimulatory chaperone grp170 to elicit systemic tumor immunity may be used to improve treatment outcomes for prostate cancer when combined with other treatment modalities. abstract. several studies have suggested a positive correlation between heat shock protein (hsp) expression and tumor immunogenicity. independently, many studies have shown that hsp purified from tumors can be used as a tumor-specific vaccine. in this study, we have explored the connection between hsp expression and anti-tumor immunity by transducing murine ct26 colon carcinoma cells with the cdna of a major hsp, i.e. hsp110. we have shown that over-expression of hsp110 has no effect on ct26 tumor cell growth in vitro, and does not inhibit their anchorage-independent growth capacity. however, in situ, hsp110 over-expressing ct26 tumor (ct26-hsp110) grew at a significantly reduced rate as compared to the wild-type ct26 tumor in immunocompetent mice. moreover, immunization of mice with inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells significantly inhibited the growth of wild-type ct26 tumor. this immunity was associated with an increased frequency of tumor-specific t cells after vaccination. an in vivo antibody depletion assay demonstrated that inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells elicited anti-tumor responses involving cd8+ t cells and natural killer (nk) cells, but not cd4+ t cells. lastly, the effect of the addition of granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm–csf) to these vaccine formulations was determined. mice immunized with irradiated ct26-hsp110 cells combined with gm–csf-producing bystander cells revealed a complete inhibition of ct26 tumor growth, indicating a synergy between inactivated ct26-hsp110 vaccine activity and gm–csf. these observations demonstrate that manipulation of hsp110 expression in tumors, specifically when combined with gm–csf, represents a potentially powerful approach to cancer vaccine formulation.
we know that upper body obesity is associated with metabolic complications, but we don't know how regional body fat distribution influences postprandial lipemia in obese adults. thus, this study explored the respective effects of android or gynoid types of obesity and fasting triglyceridemia on postprandial lipid metabolism and especially triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. twenty-four obese and 6 lean normotriglyceridemic women (control), age 24-57 yr, were enrolled. among obese women with an android phenotype, 9 exhibited normal plasma triglyceride levels (mean: 1.38 mmol/l) (ntao), and 7 displayed a frank hypertriglyceridemia (mean: 2.40 mmol/l) (htao). the 8 patients with a gynoid phenotype had normal triglyceride levels (mean: 1.00 mmol/l) (go). all were given a mixed test meal providing 40 g triglycerides. serum and incremental chylomicron triglycerides 0-7 h areas under the curve (aucs) as well as triglyceride levels in apob-48-containing triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (trls) or chylomicrons were significantly higher in htaos and ntaos than in gos and controls postprandially. the size of chylomicron particles was bigger in controls and gos than in htaos and ntaos postprandially. android obese subjects showed abnormally elevated fasting apob-48 and apob-100 triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (trl) levels. most abnormalities that were found correlated to plasma levels of insulin and apoc-iii. in conclusion, an abnormal postprandial lipid pattern is a trait of abdominal obesity even without fasting hypertriglyceridemia. apoliprotein (apo) b-100-containing very low density lipoprotein (vldl) particles secreted from the liver accumulate in plasma during alimentary lipemia. to determine whether changes of vldl composition occur in the postprandial state that may render these lipoproteins more atherogenic, apoe, c-i, c-ii, and c-iii, and lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol) were measured in svedberg flotation (sf) 60-400 (large) and sf 20-60 (small) vldl before and after an oral fat load. ten normotriglyceridemic (ntg) and three hypertriglyceridemic (htg) healthy men were given a fat-rich mixed meal (1,000 kcal with 60.2 e% from fat). triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from plasma samples obtained before (fasting) and at 2-h intervals after the meal. vldl was then separated from chylomicrons and their remnants by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies 4g3 and 5e11, recognizing apob-100, but not apob-48 epitopes. large and small vldl isolated from the ntg group were enriched with apoe and c-i, and cholesterol, but depleted of apoc-ii in the postprandial state, whereas the apoc-iii, triglyceride, and phospholipid contents were essentially unchanged. the compositional changes of vldl in htg subjects were similar but more pronounced compared with ntg subjects. we conclude that postprandial lipemia in healthy men induces transient compositional alterations of vldl that link these lipoprotein species to the formation of atherosclerosis.
backgroundpercutaneous biopsy is the reference diagnostic procedure for adult musculoskeletal tumors. its place in pediatrics is controversial and open biopsy remains recommended.objectiveto assess diagnostic performance and feasibility of percutaneous biopsy performed on children and young adults for suspected malignant bone tumors.materials and methodswe conducted a 5-year retrospective study including patients ≤21 years who underwent a bone biopsy for a suspected malignant bone tumor. we assessed diagnostic yield (percentage of analyzable biopsies), accuracy (percentage of accurate diagnoses among all analyzable biopsies) and efficacy (percentage of accurate diagnoses among all biopsies), costs, anesthetic requirements and sample availability for biomedical research. patients diagnosed with an open biopsy were used to compare diagnostic performances, anesthetic requirements and costs.resultswe included 90 percutaneous and 27 open biopsies in 117 patients. for percutaneous biopsy, diagnostic yield was 95.5% (95% confidence interval [ci] 88.8–98.7%), accuracy was 96.2% (95% ci 86.8–99.5%) and efficacy was 89.3% (95% ci 78.1–96.0%). there was no statistical difference with open biopsy (fisher exact test, p > 0.05). mean costs were reduced with percutaneous biopsy: €1,937 (standard deviation [sd] €2,408) versus €6,362 (sd €5,033; mann-whitney, p < 0.0001). thirty-two of the 48 (67%) patients included in clinical trials and diagnosed with percutaneous biopsy had suitable samples for ancillary analyses.conclusionpercutaneous biopsy is a valid alternative to open biopsy for diagnosing pediatric and young adult primary malignant bone tumors. the most appropriate protocol for the biopsy of musculoskeletal tumours is controversial, with some authors advocating ct-guided core biopsy. at our hospital the initial biopsies of most musculoskeletal tumours has been by operative core biopsy with evaluation by frozen section which determines whether diagnostic tissue has been obtained and, if possible, gives the definitive diagnosis. in order to determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this protocol we have undertaken a retrospective audit of biopsies of musculoskeletal tumours performed over a period of two years. a total of 104 patients had biopsies according to this regime. all gave the diagnosis apart from one minor error which did not alter the management of the patient. there was no requirement for re-biopsy. this protocol was more labour-intensive and 38% more costly than ct-guided core biopsy (au$1804 vs au$1308). however, the accuracy and avoidance of the anxiety associated with repeat biopsy outweighed these disadvantages.
drugs often have undesired side effects. in the heart, they can induce lethal arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. the risk evaluation of a new compound is costly and can take a long time, which often hinders the development of new drugs. here we establish a high resolution, multiscale computational model to quickly assess the cardiac toxicity of new and existing drugs. the input of the model is the drug-specific current block from single cell electrophysiology; the output is the spatio-temporal activation profile and the associated electrocardiogram. we demonstrate the potential of our model for a low risk drug, ranolazine, and a high risk drug, quinidine: for ranolazine, our model predicts a prolonged qt interval of 19.4% compared to baseline and a regular sinus rhythm at 60.15 beats per minute. for quinidine, our model predicts a prolonged qt interval of 78.4% and a spontaneous development of torsades de pointes both in the activation profile and in the electrocardiogram. our model reveals the mechanisms by which electrophysiological abnormalities propagate across the spatio-temporal scales, from specific channel blockage, via altered single cell action potentials and prolonged qt intervals, to the spontaneous emergence of ventricular tachycardia in the form of torsades de pointes. our model could have important implications for researchers, regulatory agencies, and pharmaceutical companies on rationalizing safe drug development and reducing the time-to-market of new drugs. the underlying mechanism of torsade de pointes (tdp) remains of debate: perpetuation may be due to (1) focal activity or (2) re‐entrant activity. the onset of tdp correlates with action potential heterogeneities in different regions of the heart. we studied the mechanism of perpetuation of tdp in silico using a 2d model of human cardiac tissue and an anatomically accurate model of the ventricles of the human heart. we found that the mechanism of perpetuation tdp depends on the degree of heterogeneity. if the degree of heterogeneity is large, focal activity alone can sustain a tdp, otherwise re‐entrant activity emerges. this result can help to understand the relationship between the mechanisms of tdp and tissue properties and may help in developing new drugs against it.
protein malnutrition has a significant and measurable effect on the rate and timing of growth. heterochrony is generally viewed as the study of evolutionary changes in the relative rates and timing of growth and development. although changes in growth commonly result from experimental manipulations of diet, nobody has previously attempted to explain such changes from a heterochronic perspective. we use a heterochronic perspective to compare a group of squirrel monkeys fed a low-protein diet to individuals on a high-protein diet, but, in contrast to previous works, we focus particularly on the effects of environmental and not genetic factors. in the present study, gould's (1977) and godfrey and sutherland's (1996) methodologies for studying heterochrony, as well as geometric morphometrics, are used to compare two groups of saimiri sciureus boliviensis. two groups of saimiri were constructed on the basis of the protein content in their diets: a high-protein group (hp) (n=12) and a low-protein group (lp) (n=12). all individuals are males born in captivity. two major functional components of the skull, the neurocranium and the face, were analysed. four minor components were studied in each major component. comparison of craniofacial ontogeny patterns based on major and minor components suggests that changes in the skull of lp animals can be explained by heterochrony. the skull of lp animals exhibits isomorphism produced by proportioned dwarfism. our results suggest that heterochrony can be environmentally, rather than exclusively genetically, induced. the study of genetic assimilation (waddington, 1953, 1956; see scharloo, 1991; hallgrimsson et al., 2002) has demonstrated that environmentally induced phenotypes often have a genetic basis, and thus parallel changes can be easily induced genetically. it is possible that proportioned dwarfism is far more common than currently appreciated. improvements in data gathering technology have made it possible to quickly and accurately digitize large numbers of objects. the three dimensional coordinates of 44 homologous landmarks were obtained from a sample of 104 squirrel monkey (saimiri sciureus) crania. after sorting by sex, the crania were assigned to one of four dental age groups. two quantitative methods, euclidean distance matrix analysis (edma) and finite element scaling analysis (fesa), were used to study craniofacial form change during growth within each sex. form differences between the sexes at each developmental age were also examined. both sexes show a small amount of cranial growth overall; however, there are areas of substantial local growth. these areas include the anterior neurocranium and basicranium, the basioccipital, and the anterior palate. sexual dimorphism in the craniofacial complex is minimal. the most dimorphic regions are the orbitonasal portion of the lower face, the cranial base, and the palate.
background although early development of testes appears normal in boys with klinefelter syndrome (ks), spermatogonial stem cell (ssc) depletion occurs in mid puberty, leading to infertility. cryopreservation of sscs prior to stem cell loss is an option that is currently offered to boys who have to undergo gonadotoxic treatments. this study aimed to explore the possibility of preserving sscs in pubertal ks adolescents by testicular tissue banking.   methods a retrospective study was conducted in seven non-mosaic 47,xxy adolescents, aged 13-16 years, who were invited for an experimental testicular tissue banking programme during their follow-up at the paediatric endocrinology department of the uz brussel between 2009 and 2011. paraffin-embedded testicular tissue was sectioned and stained with haematoxylin-eosin, and immunostainings were performed for mage-a4, anti-mullerian hormone, inhibin α and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. the presence of spermatogenesis and/or spermatogonia was evaluated.   results massive fibrosis and hyalinization was observed in all but one ks patients. although spermatogonia were seen in five patients, spermatogonia were only present in tubules showing normal architecture in the youngest patient who also had normal follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin b concentrations.   conclusions testicular tissue cryopreservation in ks adolescents should be recommended as soon as possible, probably before hormonal changes of failing sertoli cell function are detected. context the pathogenesis and mechanisms behind the degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in testes of subjects with klinefelter syndrome (ks) are yet unknown.   objective the objective of this prospective clinical study was to characterize the testicular degeneration process during puberty in boys with ks by describing the immunoexpression of some developmentally regulated markers of testis maturation in relation to serum levels of reproductive hormones.   setting this study was conducted at a university central hospital pediatric referral endocrinology outpatient clinic.   patients patients consisted of 14 boys with ks aged 10.1 to 14.0 yr.   main outcome measures main outcome measures were immunoexpression of germ cell differentiation markers (ap-2gamma, chk2, oct-3/4, ny-eso-1, mage-a4) and androgen action-related proteins [androgen receptor (ar), anti-müllerian hormone (amh), mic2, inhibin b; alpha- and betab-subunits] in testicular biopsies of boys with ks in relation to serum reproductive hormone levels.   results in boys with ks, gonocytes differentiated to the spermatogonium stage, but no spermatocytes were visible. despite this, down-regulation of amh expression in the sertoli cells occurred concomitantly with decreasing serum amh levels. expression of inhibin alpha- and betab-subunits appeared in the biopsies even when circulating inhibin b levels were undetectable. in the boys with ks compared with age-matched controls, the proportion of sertoli cell nuclei expressing ar was smaller and cytoplasmic staining of sertoli cells was constantly present.   conclusions we showed with several testis-specific markers in ks that gonocytes differentiate to spermatogonia and that the degeneration of the testes accelerates at the onset of puberty. altered immunoexpression of ar indicates that a relative androgen deficiency, at least at the testicular level, develops in boys with ks during puberty.
backgroundas high-risk cardiac patients frequently remain within hospital while waiting for surgery, the aim of the present study was to determine the role of preoperative length of hospital stay on mediastinitis, and also, to assess contemporary risk factors for this complication.methodsthe source population consisted of 6653 consecutive patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, valve surgery, or both between september 2000 and september 2009 at a single tertiary care hospital. a retrospective cohort analysis was used to assess the effect of 18 preoperative variables, including length of stay, on mediastinitis.resultsmediastinitis developed in 108 patients (1.6%) resulting in an in-hospital mortality rate of 13.9%. independent predictors of mediastinitis included obesity (2.59, ci 1.58-4.23), copd (2.44, ci 1.55-3.84), diabetes (2.16, ci 1.44-3.24), and impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate. preoperative hospital stay was also found to be an independent risk factor leading to a 15% increased risk of mediastinitis per week of stay. the primary wound pathogen was coagulase negative staphylococcus (82%) followed by multi-flora isolates (49%), but was unrelated to hospital stay.conclusionsin addition to the traditional risk factors, prolonged preoperative hospital stay is also a significant and potentially modifiable predictor for the development of mediastinitis following cardiac surgery. all efforts should be made to minimize the delay in operating on hospitalized patients awaiting heart surgery. mediastinitis is a dreaded complication of cabg surgery. short-term outcomes have been described, but there have been only a few long-term studies. we examined the survival of patients undergoing isolated cabg surgery between 1992 and 2001. mediastinitis was identified during the index admission. proportional hazards regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci 95%). among 36,078 consecutive patients, there were 5749 deaths during 148,319 person years of follow-up. there were 418 cases of mediastinitis (1.16%). the incidence of death was 11.15 per 100 person/years with mediastinitis and 3.81 deaths/100 person years without. (p < 0.001). we also examined the mortality rates of patients who survived at least 6 months after their cabg surgery. patients with mediastinitis had an incidence rate of 5.70 deaths per 100 person/years while those without had a rate of 2.66 deaths per 100 person/years (p < 0.001). after adjustment for baseline differences in patient and disease characteristics, the hazard ratio was 2.12 (ci95% = 1.86,2.58; p < 0.001). the adjusted hazard ratios for patients who survived 6 months postsurgery was 1.70 (ci95% = 1.36,2.13; p < 0.001). mediastinitis is associated with a marked increase in both acute and long-term mortality rates.
olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, can acutely induce fasting insulin resistance, but we do not know whether it is able to modulate the meal-induced insulin sensitization (mis). two main experimental groups (control and olanzapine-treated) were created with two subgroups (fasted and re-fed) within each. after oral vehicle/olanzapine administration, the first meal size and duration and the total amount of consumed food was recorded in conscious rats. then, under anaesthesia, the carotid artery and jugular vein was prepared and cannulated to obtain samples for blood glucose and hormone determination as well as for insulin/glucose infusion, respectively. basal insulin sensitivity and mis was determined by homeostasis model assessment (homa) calculation and by rapid insulin sensitivity test, respectively. in fasted animals, olanzapine increased blood glucose and plasma insulin and reduced basal insulin sensitivity, but it failed to modify other hormone levels. postprandial leptin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) levels increased, and ghrelin level decreased significantly (p < 0.05) both in vehicle- and olanzapine-treated groups, but plasma insulin increased only in vehicle-treated animals. furthermore, decrement in ghrelin level was attenuated in olanzapine-treated animals compared to controls. there was no significant change in the first meal size and duration or in the total amount of food consumed. olanzapine had no effect on the mis. we demonstrated that olanzapine can induce insulin resistance without weight gain in healthy rats. furthermore, the mis was preserved after acute olanzapine treatment. the blunted postprandial ghrelin and insulin response could contribute to the effect of olanzapine on feeding behaviour. pharmacological induction of mis may improve the olanzapine-induced insulin resistance. selective dopamine d(2) antogonists increase meal size and decrease the rate of feeding within a meal. three experiments investigated the extent to which the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, and the prototypical antipsychotic, haloperidol, affected meal size and feeding rate. microstructural analyses of meal patterning were made over a range of drug doses administered to free feeding male lister hooded rats. haloperidol and clozapine produced a short-term increase in food intake. haloperidol (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) enhanced meal size (maximal at 0.1 mg/kg) and reduced feeding rate (monotonic decrease with increasing dose). neither clozapine (1-10 mg/kg) nor olanzapine (0.3-3 mg/kg) enhanced meal size, although both drugs produced similar reductions in feeding rate to haloperidol. these data suggest that enhancement of meal size may be correlated with a high level of extrapyramidal side effects in an antipsychotic drug. the absence of an increase in meal size by two atypical compounds suggests that the increase in body weight associated with clinical treatment with these drugs cannot be modelled by acute stimulation of meal size in the rat.
objective we conducted a cross-sectional study on the frequency and risk factors for adenomyosis in women who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions.   study design all women who consecutively underwent hysterectomy during the study period for benign gynecological conditions at 18 gynecological departments were eligible for the study. a total of 820 women entered the study. pathological data were collected prospectically.   results adenomyosis was identified in 231 women (28.2%, 95% confidence interval, ci, 24.6-32.5). the frequency of adenomyosis was similar in women with indication for surgery fibroids/menorrhagia (143 cases, 28.5%) or genital prolapse (69 cases, 28.2%). the rate ratio (rr) of adenomyosis was 1.9 (95% ci 1.2-2.8) in women reporting one or more induced abortions, in comparison with those reporting no induced abortion. women with adenomyosis reported more frequently dysmenorrhoea and chronic pelvic pain, but not dyspareunia.   conclusions this study shows that adenomyosis is common in women who undergo hysterectomy and that it is more frequent among women reporting induced abortions dysmenorrhoea and chronic pelvic pain. epidemiological studies of adenomyosis are difficult to interpret because the diagnostic criteria vary so widely that the disease may be easily over-diagnosed. this would severely hamper any attempt to define incidence and prevalence of the condition and the related risk factors, and would limit the possibility of clarifying to what extent adenomyosis contributes to clinical symptoms. there is a need for stringent and widely accepted diagnostic criteria in order to define not only the presence of adenomyosis but also depth of penetration and degree of spread of foci. moreover, the evidence available on epidemiological characteristics of women with adenomyosis is greatly biased by the type of population studied, i.e. women undergoing hysterectomy. therefore, a consensus on non-surgical diagnostic criteria at transvaginal ultrasonography and mri is indispensable and urgently needed in order to be able to conduct epidemiological studies in women younger than those evaluated until now.
this study was conducted to determine the effects of heat stress on ph, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and functionalities of breast meat in broilers. the experimental birds were exposed to 2 temperatures: 24 degrees c (control) and 41 degrees c (heat-stressed) for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h. as compared with control, the ph determinations after slaughter for 30 min and 24 h of chilling, respectively, of the pectoralis major in the heat-stressed groups were significantly lower (p < 0.05). oxidative stability of i.m. lipid in 3- and 5-h groups (p < 0.01) and protein in 2-, 3-, and 5-h groups (p < 0.01) increased. protein solubility of pectorilas major decreased after heat exposure. drip loss and cooking loss were increased in groups from 1 to 5 h of exposure. a reduced strength was noted for myofibrillar protein gels of heat-stressed breasts in exposed groups (p < 0.01); also water-holding capacity of the gels was reduced in treatments of 2, 3, and 5 h (p < 0.01). the results demonstrated that preslaughter exposures to heat reduced the oxidative stability of broiler muscle protein, which might be responsible for decreased protein functionalities such as gelation. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chemical oxidation on proteolysis susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins. myofibrils were prepared from pig m. longissimus dorsi and oxidised by a hydroxyl radical generating system. protein oxidation level was measured by the carbonyl content, free thiol group content and bityrosine formation. oxidised or non-oxidised myofibrillar proteins were exposed to papain and proteolysis was estimated by fluorescence using fluorescamine. oxidation of myofibrillar proteins was dependent upon the oxidising agent concentration. disulfide bridge and bityrosine formation indicated that oxidation by oh° can induce protein polymerization. electrophoretic study showed that myosin was the protein most sensitive to oxidation. results showed a direct and quantitative relationship between protein damages by hydroxyl radical and decreased proteolytic susceptibility. electrophoretic observations suggest that polymerization and aggregation may explain in part decreased susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins to proteolysis.
background staphylococcus aureus causes a variety of severe infections such as bacteremia and sepsis. at present, 60–80% of s. aureus isolates from taiwan are methicillin resistant (mrsa). it has been shown that certain mrsa clones circulate worldwide. the goals of this study were to identify mrsa clones in taiwan and to correlate the molecular types of isolates with their phenotypes. methods a total of 157 mrsa isolates from bacteremic patients were collected from nine medical centers. they were typed based on polymorphisms in agr, sccmec, mlst, spa, and dru. phenotypes characterized included panton-valentine leucocidin (pvl), inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance (mlsbi), vancomycin (va) and daptomycin (dap) minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), and superantigenic toxin gene profiles. difference between two consecutive samples was determined by mann-whitney-u test, and difference between two categorical variables was determined by fisher's exact test. results four major mrsa clone complexes cc1, cc5, cc8, and cc59 were found, including 4 cc1, 9 cc5, 111 cc8, and 28 cc59 isolates. these clones had the following molecular types: cc1: sccmeciv and st573; cc5: sccmecii and st5; cc8: sccmeciii, st239, and st241, and cc59: sccmeciv, sccmecvt, st59, and st338. the toxin gene profiles of these clones were cc1: sec-seg-(sei)-sell-selm-(seln)-selo; cc5: sec-seg-sei-sell-selm-(seln)-selp-tst1; cc8: sea-selk-selq, and cc59: seb-selk-selq. most isolates with sccmecvt, st59, spat437, and dru11 types were pvl + (13 isolates), while multidrug resistance (≥4 antimicrobials) were associated with sccmeciii, st239, spa t037, agri, and dru14 (119 isolates) (p<0.001). one hundred and twenty four isolates with the following molecular types had higher va mic: sccmecii and sccmeciii; st5, st239, and st241; spa t002, t037, and t421; dru4, dru10, dru12, dru13, and dru14 (p<0.05). no particular molecular types were found to be associated with mlsbi phenotype. conclusions four major mrsa clone complexes were found in taiwan. further studies are needed to delineate the evolution of mrsa isolates. abstract clonal complex 59 (cc59) community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa) strains were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, diagnostic dna microarrays, and pcrs targeting staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) elements and panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl). six distinct groups within cc59 were characterized. at least seven different variants of sccmec elements were identified (iva [2b], ivb [2b], ivd [2b], iv variant [2b], iva [2b&5], v variant [5c2], and v [5c2&5]). (the structural type is indicated by a roman numeral, with a lowercase letter indicating the subtype, and the ccr complex and the mec complex are indicated by an arabic numeral and an uppercase letter, respectively. where there is an extra ccr element, this is indicated by “&” and an arabic numeral designating the ccr type.) the first group is similar to the american sequence type 59 (st59) mrsa-iv ca-mrsa strain usa1000. the second group includes a pvl-negative st87 strain with an sccmec element of subtype ivb (2b). the third group comprises pvl-variable st59 mrsa-iv strains harboring multiple sccmec iv subtypes. pvl-negative st59 mrsa strains with multiple or composite sccmec elements (iva [2b&5]) form the fourth group. group 5 corresponds to the internationally known “taiwan clone,” a pvl-positive strain with a variant sccmec element (v [5c2&5]). this strain proved to be the most common cc59 mrsa strain isolated in western australia. finally, group 6 encompasses the st59 mrsa-v variant (5c2). the differentiation of cc59 into groups and strains indicates a rapid evolution and spread of sccmec elements. observed differences between groups of strains as well as intrastrain variability within a group facilitate the tracing of their spread.
the retinoic acid receptor beta2(rarβ2) is a type of nuclear receptor that is activated by both all-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid, which has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor gene in different types of human tumors. previous reports demonstrated that the frequency of rarβ2 methylation was significantly higher in prostate cancer patients compared with controls, but the relationship between rarβ2 promoter methylation and pathological stage or gleason score of prostate cancer remained controversial. therefore, a meta-analysis of published studies investigating the effects of rarβ2 methylation status in prostate cancer occurrence and association with both pathological stage and gleason score in prostate cancer was performed in the study. a total of 12 eligible studies involving 777 cases and 404 controls were included in the pooled analyses. under the random-effects model, the pooled or of rarβ2 methylation in prostate cancer patients, compared to non-cancer controls, was 17.62 with 95%ci = 6.30–49.28. the pooled or with the fixed-effects model of pathological stage in rassf1a methylated patients, compared to unmethylated patients, was 0.67 (95%ci = 0.40–1.09) and the pooled or of low-gs in rarβ2 methylated patients by the random-effect model, compared to high-gs rarβ2 methylated patients, was 0.54 (95%ci = 0.28–1.04). this study showed that rarβ2 might be a potential biomarker in prostate cancer prevention and diagnosis. the detection of rarβ2 methylation in urine or serum is a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool in prostate cancer. the present findings also require confirmation through adequately designed prospective studies. background gene expression can be silenced through the methylation of specific sites in the promoter region. this mechanism of gene silencing has an important role in the carcinogenesis of prostate and other cancers. although tumor-associated stromal cells also exhibit changes in gene expression, promoter methylation has not been described in these cells.   methods tumor epithelia, tumor-associated stroma and normal epithelia, and stroma adjacent to tumor tissues were isolated from whole-mount prostatectomy specimens (two per patient) of patients (n = 5) with localized prostate cancer and from normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens (two per patient) from men (n = 5) without prostate cancer by using laser capture microdissection or expression microdissection. the methylation status of three genes important in prostate carcinogenesis, gstp1, rarbeta2, and cd44, were evaluated using quantitative methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction.   results gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in the tumor epithelium of all five prostate cancer patients and in the tumor-associated stroma in four of the five patients. cd44 was methylated in the tumor epithelium from four of the five patients but not in the tumor stroma. gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in normal epithelium of two and four patients, respectively, and in normal stroma of one and two patients, respectively, that were isolated from regions adjacent to the tumors and may have resulted from a tumor-field effect; cd44 methylation was not observed in normal epithelium or stroma. in contrast, normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens showed no promoter methylation in gstp1, rarbeta2, or cd44.   conclusions the observation of promoter methylation in the non-neoplastic cells of the prostate tumor microenvironment may advance our understanding of prostate cancer development and progression and lead to new diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
goal: to investigate the hpv prevalence and characterize the expression of potential molecular surrogate markers of hpv infection in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. materials and methods: the prevalence of hpv in individuals with and without esophageal cancer (ec) was determined by using multiplex pcr; p16 and p53 protein levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry (ihc). results: high-risk hpv (hr-hpv) was found in the same frequency (13.8%) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) and in healthy individuals. the p53 expression was positive in 67.5% of tumor tissue, 20.0% of adjacent non-tumoral tissue and 1.8% of normal esophageal tissue. p16 was positive in 11.6% of esophageal cancer cases and 4.7% of adjacent non-tumoral tissue. p16 was undetectable among control group samples. p53 and p16 levels were not significantly associated with the hpv status. conclusions: these results suggest that hr-hpv types are not associated with the development of escc and that p53 and p16 protein expression have no relationship with hpv infection in normal or cancerous esophagus. molecular prognostic indicators for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (oscc), including hpv‐dna detection, epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and p16 expression, have been suggested in the literature, but none of these are currently used in clinical practice. to compare these predictors, 106 newly diagnosed oscc for the presence of hpv‐dna and expression of p16 and egfr were analyzed. the 5‐year disease‐free survival (dfs) and overall survival (os) were calculated in relation to these markers and a multivariate cox analysis was performed. twenty‐eight percent of the cases contained oncogenic hpv‐dna and 30% were positive for p16. the p16 expression was highly correlated with the presence of hpv‐dna (p < 0.001). univariate analysis of the 5‐year dfs revealed a significantly better outcome for patients with p16‐positive tumors (84% vs. 49%, p = 0.009). egfr‐negative tumors showed a tendency toward a better prognosis in dfs (74% vs. 47%, p = 0.084) and os (70% vs. 45%, p = 0.100). remarkable and highly significant was the combination of p16 and egfr expression status, leading to 5‐year dfs of 93% for p16+/egfr− tumors vs. 39% for p16−/egfr+ tumors (p = 0.003) and to a 5‐year os of 79% vs. 38%, respectively (p = 0.010). in multivariate analysis p16 remained a highly significant prognostic marker for dfs (p = 0.030) showing a 7.5‐fold increased risk for relapse in patients with p16‐negative tumors. our data indicate that p16 expression is the most reliable prognostic marker for oscc and further might be a surrogate marker for hpv‐positive oscc. hpv+/p16+ tumors tended to have decreased egfr expression, but using both immunohistological markers has significant prognostic implications. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
obstructive sleep apnea (osa) belongs to the sleep‐related breathing disorders and is associated with cognitive impairments in learning and memory functions. the impairments in attention‐demanding cognitive functions such as working memory and executive functions are well established in osa; however, it remains unknown if less attention‐demanding implicit sequence learning is affected. in the present study, we examined implicit sequence learning in osa to probe the functional integrity of this fundamental learning mechanism. we used listening span to measure complex working memory capacity and the alternating serial reaction time (asrt) task, which enables us to measure general skill learning and sequence‐specific learning separately. twenty osa patients and 20 healthy controls participated in this study. our data show dissociation between working memory and implicit sequence learning in osa. surprisingly, osa patients showed preserved general skill and sequence‐specific learning in spite of the possible hypoxia and sleep restriction. in contrast, working memory performance measured by listening span task was impaired in the osa group. this finding suggests selective susceptibility of more attention‐demanding cognitive functions in this patient population, while implicit learning remains intact. our findings draw attention the fact that disordered sleep may have less impact on the integrity of structures connected to implicit sequence learning. study objective to investigate which memory processes are affected by obstructive sleep apnea (osa).   design three separate memory systems were investigated in patients with osa and normal subjects. verbal episodic memory was tested after forced encoding, in order to control the level of attention during item presentation; procedural memory was tested using a simplified version of a standard test with an interfering task; lastly, working memory was examined with validated paradigms based on a theoretical model.   setting sleep laboratory and outpatient sleep clinic in a french tertiary-care university hospital.   participants ninety-five patients with osa and 95 control subjects matched for age and level of education. group 1 (54 patients, 54 controls) underwent an extensive battery of tasks evaluating verbal episodic, procedural, and working memory. group 2 (16 patients, 16 controls) underwent procedural memory tests only, and group 3 (25 patients, 25 controls) working memory tests only.   interventions n/a.   measurements and results compared with matched controls, patients with osa exhibited a retrieval deficit of episodic memory but intact maintenance, recognition, and forgetfulness; decreased overall performance in procedural memory, although pattern learning did occur; and impairment of specific working memory capabilities despite normal short-term memory. no consistent correlation was found between osa severity and memory deficit. the long duration of the test session did not negatively impact the patients' performance.   conclusions memory impairment in osa is mild and does not affect all memory processes but, rather, specific aspects, underscoring the need for extensive and specific memory testing in clinical and research settings.
temporal heterogeneity of water supply can alter the biomass growth of plants, even when the same total amount of water is provided. most studies of heterogeneous watering have focused on responses of whole populations rather than individuals in a population. the effects of water supply heterogeneity may also depend on nutrient levels. thus, we investigated the integrated effects of water supply heterogeneity and nutrient levels on plants within a population. six plants of perilla frutescens per pot were grown under different combinations of frequency of water supply and nutrient level. the effects on yield per pot, individual biomass, and allocation to roots were analyzed after a 44-day watering regime. a homogeneous water supply resulted in a greater yield per pot and greater biomass of individual plants than a heterogeneous supply. however, the interaction between water supply heterogeneity and nutrient level was significant only in larger individuals, not in smaller plants or at the p. water supply heterogeneity affected the growth of all plants, but the effects differed among individuals depending on their relative size within their population. it is therefore important to focus not only on whole-population characteristics such as yield but also on individuals in a population in order to reveal the detailed effects of water supply heterogeneity. background and aims size-asymmetric competition occurs when larger plants have a disproportionate advantage in competition with smaller plants. it has been hypothesized that nutrient heterogeneity may promote it. experiments testing this hypothesis are inconclusive, and in most cases have evaluated the effects of nutrient heterogeneity separately from other environmental factors. the aim of this study was to test, using populations of lolium perenne, plantago lanceolata and holcus lanatus, two hypotheses: (a) nutrient heterogeneity promotes size-asymmetric competition; and (b) nutrient heterogeneity interacts with both atmospheric co2 partial pressure (p(co2)) and nutrient availability to determine the magnitude of this response.   methods microcosms consisting of monocultures of the three species were grown for 90 d in a factorial experiment with the following treatments: p(co2) (37.5 and 70 pa) and nutrient availability (na; 40 and 120 mg of n added as organic material) combined with different spatial distribution of the organic material (nh; homogeneous and heterogeneous). differences in the size of individual plants within populations (size inequality) were quantified using the coefficient of variation of individual above-ground biomass and the combined biomass of the two largest individuals in each microcosm. increases in size inequality were associated with size-asymmetric competition.   key results size inequality increased when the nutrients were heterogeneously supplied in the three species. the effects of nh on this response were more pronounced under high nutrient supply in both plantago and holcus (significant na x nh interactions) and under elevated p(co2) in plantago (significant p(co2) x na x nh interaction). no significant two- and three-way interactions were found for lolium.   conclusions our first hypothesis was supported by our results, as nutrient heterogeneity promoted size-asymmetric competition in the three species evaluated. nutrient supply and p(co2) modified the magnitude of this effect in plantago and holcus, but not in lolium. thus, our second hypothesis was partially supported.
after 10 h osmotic stress in 25% polyethylene glycol (peg6000) solution (−1.8 mpa) at 25 °c in darkness, the etiolated mungbean seedlings were transferred to pure water for recovery. the ethylene release rate and the level of reactive oxygen species (ros), including superoxide radical (o2−) and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2), were investigated during the recovery process. the results showed that ethylene production rate and amount of ros increased dramatically after osmotic stress, and a close correlation was observed between ethylene release rate and concentrations of ros. inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (avg) or aminooxyacetic acid (aoa), could reduce the ethylene release rate, but had no significant influence to the content of o2− and h2o2. as well as, silver thiosulfate (sts), an inhibitor of ethylene action, exhibited no obvious effect to the concentration of ros, showing stress-inducible ethylene was not the cause for the increase of stress-inducible ros. on the other hand, exogenous generator of superoxide radical (methylviologen, mv, or sodium dithionite, na2s2o4) could enhance the ethylene production evidently, which could be inhibited by exogenous scavenger of superoxide radical (superoxide dismutase, sod, or 1, 4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2) octane, dabco). however, either exogenous h2o2 or catalase (cat) had no significant influence on ethylene production. the results suggested that it was superoxide radical but not h2o2which was involved directly in osmotic stress-inducible ethylene biosynthesis. the dual-role of superoxide radical on stress ethylene biosynthesis was also discussed. abstract. the production of ethylene by mesocarp tissue of winter squash is induced by mechanical wounding. we isolated a cdna fragment (wsacs2) from the wounded mesocarp tissue of winter-squash (cucurbita maxima duch.) fruit by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using primers that corresponded to two conserved amino acid sequences found in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) synthases. the sequence of wsacs2 cdna was almost identical to that of the cdna for a wound-inducible acc synthase (cm-acs1) reported by n. nakajima et␣al. 1990, plant cell physiol 31: 1021–1029, with only one nucleotide difference. the expression of the wsacs2 transcript in tissue disks was examined by northern blotting analysis. the accumulation of wsacs2 mrna in the wounded tissue disks was inhibited by treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, which is known as an inhibitor of superoxide-generating nad(p)h oxidases. the addition of xanthine and xanthine oxidase, which form a superoxide-generating system, strongly induced the accumulation of the wsacs2 transcript within 30 min and the level of the transcript fell thereafter. we measured levels of active oxygen species that were generated in the tissue disks by using chemiluminescence reagents and found that the chemiluminescence signal became apparent within a few seconds after wounding. the synthesis of the wsacs2 transcript was slightly inhibited by inhibitors of lipoxygenase, which is involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid. methyl jasmonate stimulated the synthesis of the wsacs2 transcript in the tissue disks.
the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of interpregnancy interval as a risk factor on multiple adverse perinatal outcomes. objective: to estimate whether interpregnancy interval is independently associated with increased risk of perinatal death and other adverse perinatal outcomes. methods: we investigated the effect of interpregnancy interval on perinatal outcomes in 1,125,430 pregnancies recorded in the perinatal information system database of the latin american center for perinatology and human development, montevideo, uruguay, between 1985 and 2004. odds ratios (ors) were adjusted for 16 major confounding factors using multiple logistic regression models. results: compared with infants with interpregnancy intervals of 18–23 months, those born to women with intervals shorter than 6 months had an increased risk of early neonatal death (adjusted or 1.49, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.06–1.96), fetal death (adjusted or 1.54, 95% ci 1.28–1.83), low birth weight (adjusted or 1.88, 95% ci 1.78–1.90), very low birth weight (adjusted or 2.01, 95% ci 1.73–2.31), preterm birth (adjusted or 1.80, 95% ci 1.71–1.89), very preterm birth (adjusted or 1.95, 95% ci 1.67–2.26), and small for gestational age (adjusted or 1.30, 95% ci 1.25–1.36). intervals of 6–11 months and 60 months and longer were also associated with a significantly greater risk for the 7 adverse perinatal outcomes. conclusion: in latin america, interpregnancy intervals shorter than 12 months and longer than 59 months are independently associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. these data suggest that spacing pregnancies appropriately could prevent perinatal deaths and other adverse perinatal outcomes in the developing world. level of evidence: ii-2
backgroundthe worldwide increase in obesity is becoming a major health concern. general practitioners (gps) play a central role in managing obesity. we aimed to examine swiss gps self-reported practice in diagnosis and treatment of obesity with a special focus on the performance of waist measurement.methodsa structured self-reported questionnaire was mailed to 323 gps recruited from four urban physician networks in switzerland. measures included professional experience, type of practice, obesity-related continuing medical education (cme) and practice in dealing with obesity such as waist measurement. we assessed the association between the performance of waist measurement and obesity-related cme by multivariate ordered logistic regression controlling for gp characteristics as potential confounders.resultsa total of 187 gps responded to the questionnaire. more than half of the gps felt confident in managing obesity. the majority of the gps (73%) spent less than 4 days in the last 5 years on obesity-related cme. more than half of gps gave advice to reduce energy intakes (64%), intakes of high caloric and alcoholic drinks (56%) and to increase the physical activity (78%). half of the gps seldom performed waist measurement and documentation. the frequency of obesity-related cme was independently associated with the performance of waist measurement when controlled for gps' characteristics by multivariate ordered logistic regression.conclusionsthe majority of gps followed guideline recommendations promoting physical activity and dietary counselling. we observed a gap between the increasing evidence for waist circumference assessment as an important measure in obesity management and actual clinical practice. our data indicated that specific obesity-related cme might help to reduce this gap. obesity is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with cvd and increased morbidity and mortality. when the bmi is > or = 30 kg/m2, mortality rates from all causes, and especially cvd, are increased by 50% to 100%. there is strong evidence that weight loss in overweight and obese individuals improves risk factors for diabetes and cvd. additional evidence indicates that weight loss and the associated diuresis reduce blood pressure in both overweight hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals, reduce serum tg levels, increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and may produce some reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. of interest, even if weight loss is minimal, obese individuals showing a good level of cardiorespiratory fitness are at reduced risk for cardiovascular mortality than lean but poorly fit subjects. insulin and catecholamines have pronounced metabolic effects on human adipose tissue metabolism. insulin stimulates lpl and inhibits hsl; the opposite is true for catecholamines. there is regional variation in adipocyte tg turnover favoring lipid mobilization in the visceral fat depots and lipid storage in the peripheral subcutaneous sites. the hormonal regulation of adipocyte tg turnover is altered in obesity and is most marked in central obesity. there is resistance to insulin stimulation of lpl; however, lpl activity in fasted obese subjects is increased and remains so following weight reduction. catecholamine-induced lipolysis is enhanced in visceral fat but decreased in subcutaneous fat. numerous adaptive responses take place with physical training. these adaptations result in a more efficient system for oxygen transfer to muscle, which is now able to better utilize the unlimited lipid stores instead of the limited carbohydrate reserves available. in addition, the reduced adipose tissue mass represents an important mechanical advantage, allowing better long-term work. gender differences have been reported in the adaptation of adipose tissue metabolism to aerobic exercise training. physical training helps counteract the permissive and affluent environment that predisposes reduced-obese subjects to regain weight. an exercise program using weight resistance modalities may also be included safely, and it improved program retention in a multidisciplinary weight management program that was designed for obese children. thirty to 45 minutes of physical activity of moderate intensity, performed 3 to 5 days a week, should be encouraged. all adults should set a long-term goal to accumulate at least 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, and preferably all days. public health interventions promoting walking are likely to be the most successful. indeed, walking is unique because of its safety, accessibility, and popularity. it is noteworthy that there is a clear dissociation between the adaptation of cardiorespiratory fitness and the improvements in the metabolic risk profile that can be induced by endurance training programs. it appears that as long as the increase in energy expenditure is sufficient, low-intensity endurance exercise is likely to generate beneficial metabolic effects that would be essentially similar to those produced by high-intensity exercise. the clinician should therefore focus on the improvement of the metabolic profile rather than on weight loss alone. realistic goals should be set between the clinician and the patient, with a weight loss of approximately of 0.5 to 1 pound per week. it should be kept in mind that since it generally takes years to become overweight or obese, a weight loss pattern of 0.5 or 1 pound per week will require time and perseverance to reach the proposed target. however, the use of physical activity as a method to lose weight seems inversely related to patients' age and bmi and directly related to the level of education. thus, public health interventions helping these groups to become physically active remain a challenge and further emphasize the importance of the one-on-one interaction between the clinician/health care professional with the obese individual "at risk" of cvd. this notion is critical, as it has been shown that less than half of obese adults have reported being advised to lose weight under the guidance of health care professionals.
the parasitic protozoan leishmania donovani is the causative organism for visceral leishmaniasis (vl) which persists in the host macrophages by deactivating its signaling machinery resulting in a critical shift from proinflammatory (th1) to an anti-inflammatory (th2) response. the severity of this disease is mainly determined by the production of il-12 and il-10 which could be reversed by use of effective immunoprophylactics. in this study we have evaluated the potential of arabinosylated lipoarabinomannan (ara-lam), a cell wall glycolipid isolated from non pathogenic mycobacterium smegmatis, in regulating the host effector response via effective regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) signaling cascades in leishmania donovani infected macrophages isolated from balb/c mice. ara-lam, a toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) specific ligand, was found to activate p38 mapk signaling along with subsequent abrogation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (erks) signaling. the use of pharmacological inhibitors of p38mapk and erk signaling showed the importance of these signaling pathways in the regulation of il-10 and il-12 in ara-lam pretreated parasitized macrophages. molecular characterization of this regulation of il-10 and il-12 was revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (chip) which showed that in ara-lam pretreated parasitized murine macrophages there was a significant induction of il-12 by selective phosphorylation and acetylation of histone h3 residues at its promoter region. while, il-10 production was attenuated by ara-lam pretreatment via abrogation of histone h3 phosphorylation and acetylation at its promoter region. this ara-lam mediated antagonistic regulations in the induction of il-10 and il-12 genes were further correlated to changes in the transcriptional regulators signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (socs3). these results demonstrate the crucial role played by ara-lam in regulating the mapk signaling pathway along with subsequent changes in host effector response during vl which might provide crucial clues in understanding the ara-lam mediated protection during leishmania induced pathogenesis. the cell wall component lipoarabinomannan (manlam) from mycobacterium tuberculosis is involved in the inhibition of phagosome maturation, apoptosis and interferon (ifn)‐γ signalling in macrophages and interleukin (il)‐12 cytokine secretion of dendritic cells (dc). all these processes are important for the host to mount an efficient immune response. conversely, lam isolated from non‐pathogenic mycobacteria (pilam) have the opposite effect, by inducing a potent proinflammatory response in macrophages and dcs. lams from diverse mycobacterial species differ in the modification of their terminal arabinose residues. the strong proinflammatory response induced by pilam correlates with the presence of phospho‐myo‐inositol on the terminal arabinose. interestingly, recent work indicates that the biosynthetic precursor of lam, lipomannan (lm), which is also present in the cell wall, displays strong proinflammatory effects, independently of which mycobacterial species it is isolated from. results from in vitro assays and knock‐out mice suggest that lm, like pilam, mediates its biological activity via toll‐like receptor 2. we hypothesize that the lam/lm ratio might be a crucial factor in determining the virulence of a mycobacterial species and the outcome of the infection. recent progress in the identification of genes involved in the biosynthesis of lam is discussed, in particular with respect to the fact that enzymes controlling the lam/lm balance might represent targets for new antitubercular drugs. in addition, inactivation of these genes may lead to attenuated strains of m. tuberculosis for the development of new vaccine candidates.
purpose to establish non-radioactive assays for detection of antibodies (abs) to the acetylcholine receptor (achr) and to muscle specific kinase (musk). to show that the assays can be used in tianjin for testing patients with mg.   method achr and musk abs in 51 chinese mg patients' sera were tested in oxford, uk, using the conventional radioimmunoprecipitation assay (ripa), a recently described cell-based assay (cba), and a new non-radioactive fluorescence immunoprecipitation assay (fipa) which can measure both achr and musk antibodies in one step. 102 mg sera were subsequently tested by cba and fipa in tianjin, china. based on the different serological subgroups, the clinical features of these 153 mg patients were analyzed.   results we first confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of the assays in oxford. there was good agreement between the fipa and the ripa for achr abs (r² = 0.6; p < 0.0001) with 80% positivity in the ripa and 76% in the fipa. two patients were positive for musk abs (4% of total) by both ripa and fipa assays. cba was more sensitive for musk abs, identifying an additional 3 patients. in tianjin, using the fipa and cba, 84/102 (82%) achr ab positive patients and four musk ab positive patients were identified. in the whole group of 153 mg patients, there were no differences in clinical features between different antibody subgroups. however, there were 30 patients with thymomas (20%), of whom one had musk antibodies. moreover, two patients with purely ocular mg also had musk antibodies.   conclusions both the fipa and cba were established in china and should prove useful for diagnostic testing. including the cba for musk antibodies increased the number of musk-mg patients to 6% of the total, and 33% of the patients without achr antibodies. the clinical features were mainly relatively mild but thymic tumors were common. approximately 15% of 1patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (mg) lack detectable circulating antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (achrab), referred to as seronegative mg (snmg). during the last 3 years, antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (muskab) were found in about 40 to 70% of patients with snmg.1–5⇓⇓⇓⇓ we report the first muskab survey among chinese patients with snmg and compare the features of muskab-positive patients with those of caucasian patients.  during last 10 years, we collected data from 774 myasthenic patients (389 with the ocular type and 385 generalized type) at the shin kong wu ho-su memorial hospital. among patients with generalized mg, 38 (9.8%) were seronegative for achrab. we enrolled 26 of these patients, who had been monitored regularly; 20 were women and 6 were men (table). twenty patients were in osserman stage iia, four were in iib, and two patients were in stage iii. limb weakness was the most common …
down syndrome (ds) is the leading chromosomal cause of intellectual disability, yet the neural substrates of learning and memory deficits remain poorly understood. here, we interrogate neural networks linked to learning and memory in a well-characterized model of ds, the ts65dn mouse. we report that ts65dn mice exhibit exploratory behavior that is not different from littermate wild-type (wt) controls yet behavioral activation of arc mrna transcription in pyramidal neurons of the ca1 region of the hippocampus is altered in ts65dn mice. in wt mice, a 5 min period of exploration of a novel environment resulted in arc mrna transcription in 39% of ca1 neurons. by contrast, the same period of exploration resulted in only ~20% of ca1 neurons transcribing arc mrna in ts65dn mice indicating increased sparsity of the behaviorally induced ensemble. like wt mice the ca1 pyramidal neurons of ts65dn mice reactivated arc transcription during a second exposure to the same environment 20 min after the first experience, but the size of the reactivated ensemble was only ~60% of that in wt mice. after repeated daily exposures there was a further decline in the size of the reactivated ensemble in ts65dn and a disruption of reactivation. together these data demonstrate reduction in the size of the behaviorally induced network that expresses arc in ts65dn mice and disruption of the long-term stability of the ensemble. we propose that these deficits in network formation and stability contribute to cognitive symptoms in ds. we have assessed the effects of enriched environment (ee) upon behavioral and cognitive performances of partially trisomic ts65dn (ts) mice and their control (co) littermates. enriched environment was applied to pups for 7 weeks after weaning. circadian spontaneous activity (actimetry), exploratory behavior (hole board), activity in the open field and spatial memory (morris water maze, repeated acquisition and cued paradigms) were analyzed in 86 female and 75 male mice, starting 15 days after completing enrichment. for each gender, mice were distributed in non-enriched and enriched control and trisomic groups. enriched environment reduced in trisomic females and enhanced in trisomic males' circadian activity. exploratory behavior was increased by enrichment in all groups, regardless of gender or presence of trisomy. in the morris water maze, a significant improvement of the spatial memory was observed in enriched-control females, but not in enriched-control male mice, as assessed by distances traveled. performances in the four groups of control animals were also consistently and significantly better than those of matching trisomic mice. in the acquisition trials, enrichment improved performance in trisomic female animals, but deteriorated in trisomic male mice. in all groups, changes in escape latencies and distances induced by enrichment were accounted for by changes in the total time spent in the periphery of the pool, indicating changes in learning strategy. working memory was the function more affected by enrichment. it is concluded that enriched environment induces behavioral and learning changes in trisomic mice, although gender plays a significant modulatory role.
the objectives of the present experiment were to determine whether supplementation with progesterone (lo, 1 ng ml(-1) or hi, 100 ng ml(-1)) during either the first (culture-1, day 1 to 3) or second (culture-2, day 4 to 7) phase of culture of in vitro-produced embryos alters embryo development, embryo metabolism or blastocyst cell number. the percentage of oocytes that cleaved, the percentage of cleaved embryos that developed to the morula stage or greater, the blastocyst stage or greater or the hatched blastocyst stage were similar among treatments. quantities of glucose metabolised per blastocyst per hour were similar, but when metabolic data was normalised for numbers of cells in each blastocyst, the lo treatment during culture-2 metabolised more glucose (p=0.03) compared with all other treatments. embryos receiving lo progesterone tended to have greater (p=0.085) metabolism of glucose compared with embryos receiving hi progesterone. quantities of pyruvate oxidised per blastocyst per hour, and per cell, were similar among treatments. the number of cells per blastocyst in the control group was increased (p=0.039) compared with cells in progesterone-treated groups. in conclusion, supplementation with progesterone during the culture of in vitro-produced embryos does not appear to improve embryo characteristics. the steroid hormone progesterone (p(4)) plays a key role in the reproductive events associated with pregnancy establishment and maintenance. high concentrations of circulating p(4) in the immediate post-conception period have been associated with an advancement of conceptus elongation, an associated increase in interferon-tau production and higher pregnancy rates in cattle. using in vitro and in vivo models and approximately 8500 bovine oocytes across six experiments, the aim of this study was to establish the route through which p(4) affects bovine embryo development in vitro and in vivo. mrna for p(4) receptors was present at all stages of embryo development raising the possibility of a direct effect of p(4) on the embryo. exposure to p(4) in vitro in the absence or presence of oviduct epithelial cells did not affect the proportion of embryos developing to the blastocyst stage, blastocyst cell number or the relative abundance of selected transcripts in the blastocyst. furthermore, exposure to p(4) in vitro did not affect post-hatching elongation of the embryo following transfer to synchronized recipients and recovery on day 14. by contrast, transfer of in vitro derived blastocysts to a uterine environment previously primed by elevated p(4) resulted in a fourfold increase in conceptus length on day 14. these data provide clear evidence to support the hypothesis that p(4)-induced changes in the uterine environment are responsible for the advancement in conceptus elongation reported previously in cattle and that, interestingly, the embryo does not need to be present during the period of high p(4) in order to exhibit advanced elongation.
several studies indicate that more than one cholinesterase form may be present in the blood of mammals. in this study the predominant plasma cholinesterase activity, the physiological cholinesterase activity as well as cholinesterase sex-dependent changes in non-exposed individuals of rabbit have been established. plasma cholinesterase was characterized using three substrates (acetylthiocholine iodide, propionylthiocholine iodide, and s-butyrylthiocholine iodide) and three cholinesterase inhibitors (eserine sulfate, bw284c51 and iso-ompa). the results indicated that propionylthiocholine was the preferred substrate by plasma cholinesterase followed by acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, and the predominant enzymatic activity was acetylcholinesterase. physiological plasma cholinesterase activity was 198.9 ± 5.8 nmol/min/ml for male and 205.2 ± 5.0 nmol/min/ml for female using acetylthiocholine as substrate. thus, sex had no significant effect on the physiological cholinesterase activity (p>0.05). in addition, the in vivo and in vitro sensitivity of plasma cholinesterase to diazinon was also investigated. in rabbits exposed to single doses of diazinon (25 or 125 mg/kg) the higher inhibitions of plasma cholinesterase were reached 9h after oral administration (53% and 87% inhibition, respectively). cholinesterase activity significantly recovered up to values similar to pre-administration between 3 and 7d depending on the administered dose and sex of the animals. plasma cholinesterase activity decreased to 24%, 53% and 74% of the initial activity at 9h of in vitro exposure to 1.25, 3.13 and 6.25mg/l of diazinon, respectively, and it remained steadily depressed throughout the experimental period (10d). this study has demonstrated the sensitivity of cholinesterase activity in plasma of rabbits following both in vivo and in vitro exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of diazinon. an automated procedure for estimation of blood cholinesterase activities was evaluated and used to determine baseline cholinesterase activities in rabbits. in addition, the kinetics of cholinesterase inhibition and recovery from diazinon challenge were determined by use of this procedure. the procedure developed is a modification of the colorimetric ellman technique, adapted for use with the instrumentation laboratory multistat iii plus centrifugal analyzer. the substrate used in this technique was acetylthiocholine. baseline cholinesterase activities in domestic rabbits were plasma cholinesterase, 360 mu/ml; red blood cell cholinesterase, 2,658 mu/ml; and whole blood cholinesterase, 1,332 mu/ml. rabbits were challenged with 0.3 ld50 (40 mg/kg) of diazinon, and blood samples were obtained at hourly, then daily intervals. cholinesterase activity in these samples was determined to monitor the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor diazinon in vivo, as estimated by the multistat iii plus centrifugal analyzer procedure. plasma cholinesterase activity decreased to 4% within 6 h, whereas red blood cell cholinesterase activity decreased to 51%. by 10 days, plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase activities had returned to 100 and 91%, respectively, of pre-challenge activities.
purposemulti-hour ski mountaineering energy balance may be negative and intake below recommendations.methodsathletes on the ‘patrouille des glaciers’ racecourses (17 on course z, 27 km, +2,113 m; 11 on course a, 26 km, +1,881 m) volunteered. pre-race measurements included body mass, stature, vo2max, and heart rate (hr) vs vo2 at simulated altitude; race measurements hr, altitude, incline, location, and food and drink intake (a). energy expenditure (ee) was calculated from altitude corrected hr derived vo2.resultsrace time was 5 h 7 min ± 44 min (mean ± sd, z) and 5 h 51 min ± 53 min (a). subjects spent 19.2 ± 3.2 mj (z), respectively, 22.6 ± 2.9 mj (a) during the race. energy deficit was −15.5 ± 3.9 mj (a); intake covered 20 ± 7 % (a). overall energy cost of locomotion (ec) was 9.9 ± 1.3 j m−1 kg−1 (z), 8.0 ± 1.0 j m−1 kg−1 (a). uphill ec was 11.7 ± 1 j m−1 kg−1 (z, 13 % slope) and 15.7 ± 2.3 j m−1 kg−1 (a, 19 % slope). race a subjects lost −1.5 ± 1.1 kg, indicating near euhydration. age, body mass, gear mass, vo2max and ec were significantly correlated with performance; energy deficit was not.conclusionsenergy expenditure and energy deficit of a multi-hour ski mountaineering race are very high and energy intake is below recommendations. aim the purpose of this study is to determine the energy cost (ec) of ski mountaineering and its variation with speed and ankle loading.   methods seven male skiers volunteered to participate in this study. field tests (500 m, gradient 21%) were executed on packed snow at an altitude of about 1600 m. measurements were carried out breath by breath by a portable gas analyzer. energy cost of uphill skiing was calculated from the steady state vo(2). in the speed protocol each subject was asked to repeat the same route at three different speed levels. in the weight protocol, subjects were instructed to maintain the preferred speed for three trials on the same track while wearing different weight bands on their ankle.   results at the self-selected speed of 1.07+/-0.05 m s(-1) and without extra load beside the normal equipment, the mean value of ec on packed snow is 10.6+/-0.4 j kg(-1m)(-1). a percentage variation of the speed (%speed) produces a corresponding percentage variation of the energy cost %ec = 0.32 x %speed. the %ec as a function of the percentage of added load, %weight, with respect to the total weight of the subject, including ski, bindings, and boots is given by %ec = 1.71 x %weight.   conclusions data obtained in the present study constitute the first quantitative description of ec for ski mountaineering and result higher than for walking or snowshoeing. effects due to ankle loading appear negligible for recreational skiers, while they should be taken into account in agonistic competition.
human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection regulates a number of genes involved in the host antiviral response. we have previously reported that hcmv attenuates the expression of beta interferon (ifn) and a number of proinflammatory chemokines, and this attenuation is mediated by the hcmv immediate-early protein ie86. the present study seeks to identify the mechanism by which ie86 blocks ifnexpression. we demonstrate that the induction of ifnduring hcmv infection requires the activation of both the irf-3 and the nf b pathways. therefore, ie86 may target either pathway to block ifnexpression. our results show that ie86 does not block irf-3 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, or target gene expression. however, using gel shift analysis, we demonstrate that ie86 efficiently inhibits virus-induced binding of nf b to the ifnpromoter, resulting in attenuation of ifnand nf b-dependent gene expression. furthermore, ie86 expression inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nf b dna binding and target gene expression. together, these results identify ie86 as a nf b antagonist, which results in the suppression of nf b-dependent cytokine and chemokine gene expression. the activation of nf-kappab has long been considered a positive factor for human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) replication. the hcmv immediate-early promoter, the initial transcriptional element in the hcmv replication cycle, is activated by the transcription factor nf-kappab, and several hcmv gene products have been demonstrated to activate this transcription factor. however, the role of nf-kappab in the full replication cycle of the virus has not been carefully examined. a series of experiments that demonstrate an important inhibitory role of nf-kappab for hcmv replication in fibroblasts is presented here. using both genetic and pharmaceutical methods, it was shown that blocking nf-kappab activation in cell culture does not inhibit hcmv replication, but rather leads to a modest increase in replication. two cytokines inhibitory for hcmv, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, no longer inhibit hcmv when nf-kappab activation is blocked. furthermore, forced expression of the nf-kappab activating ikappab kinase beta (ikkbeta), but not a kinase inactive mutant, also inhibits hcmv replication. in addition, it was shown that nf-kappab signalling is essential for the production of an anti-viral factor in the supernatant of hcmv-infected fibroblasts, and identified interferon-beta as this factor. thus, the role of nf-kappab in fibroblasts is to activate a host defence against hcmv.
orographic precipitation has a large impact on channel morphology and rock uplift via a positive feedback to erosion. we show that in the eastern cordillera of bolivia, channel concavities reach their highest values where annual precipitation increases in the downstream direction, exceeding 3000 mm. the steepest channels are upstream of this zone of high concavity, where precipitation rates are <1000 mm yr−1. channels exhibit graded forms both upstream and downstream of this transient reach. we conclude that the prolonged effect of orographic erosion and related tectonic uplift is the preservation of channels with extreme concavities in the eastern cordillera. the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
negative feedback between plant and soil microbial communities can be a key determinant of vegetation structure and dynamics. previous research has shown that negative feedback between black cherry (prunus serotina) and soil pathogens is strongly distance dependent. here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of negative feedback. to examine short–term changes, we planted successive cycles of seedlings in the same soil. we found that seedling mortality increased steadily with growth cycle when sterile background soil was inoculated with living field soil but not in controls inoculated with sterilized field soil. to examine long–term changes, we quantified negative feedback across successive growth cycles in soil inoculated with living field soil from a mature forest system (more than 70 years old) versus a younger successional site (ca. 25 years old). in both cases negative feedback developed similarly. our results suggest that negative feedback can develop very quickly in forest systems, at the spatial scale of a single seedling. the janzen–connell hypothesis proposes that host-specific, distance- and/or density-dependent predators and herbivores maintain high tree diversity in tropical forests. negative feedback between plant and soil communities could be a more effective mechanism promoting species coexistence because soil pathogens can increase rapidly in the presence of their host, causing conditions unfavourable for local conspecific recruitment. here we show that a soil pathogen leads to patterns of seedling mortality in a temperate tree (prunus serotina) as predicted by the janzen–connell hypothesis. in the field, the mean distance to parent of seedling cohorts shifted away from maternal trees over a period of 3 years. seedlings were grown in soil collected 0–5 m or 25–30 m from prunus trees. sterilization of soil collected beneath trees improved seedling survival relative to unsterilized soil, whereas sterilization of distant soil did not affect survival. pythium spp., isolated from roots of dying seedlings and used to inoculate healthy seedlings, decreased survival by 65% relative to controls. our results provide the most complete evidence that native pathogens influence tree distributions, as predicted by the janzen–connell hypothesis, and suggest that similar ecological mechanisms operate in tropical and temperate forests.
the purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of fatigue on the response of the trunk to various combinations of initial static loads and step inputed loads causing rapid sagittal trunk flexion. when attempting to overcome the moments associated with sudden loading, the spine maintains stabilty by increasing joint compression forces (cholewicki & mcgill, 1996) and increasing the level of muscle coactivation, even if it may result in an increased rate of fatigue (zetterberg et al., 1987). in a study that determined the response of the spine to sudden loads causing sagittal flexion, it was found that abdominal muscles rapidly responded to the sudden load with a large increase in muscle activation (krajcarski et al., 1999). also, krajcarski et al. concluded that increases in emg amplitudes of abdominal and trunk extensor muscles were determined predominantly by the added load magnitude and not the pre-loads. chiang (in press) conducted a similar study with the difference being the trunk motion investigated was lateral bend instead of trunk flexion. similar to krajcarski et al. (1999), chiang (in press) concluded that increased muscular activity due to pre-loads leads to increases in trunk muscle stiffness and spine stability. krajcarski et al (1999) and chiang (in press) have provided a greater understanding of the active muscular response that is responsible for maintaining stability. these two studies have demonstrated that a greater preload will result in an increase in trunk stiffness, which is beneficial to the stability of the spine when exposed to sudden loads. unfortunately, the increased trunk stiffness also contributes to trunk muscle fatigue because an increase in muscular activity is what causes the increased stiffness of the trunk. since, muscle fatigue has an effect on the ability of the spine to maintain stability, it would be of significant interest to determine whether a fatigued trunk system responds differently to the preand added loads that were described by krajcarski et al (1999). objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
the purpose of this study was to explore how origin-insertion length and lengthening velocity of hamstring and psoas muscle change as a result of crouch gait. the second purpose was to study the effect of changes in walking speed, in crouch, on muscle lengths and velocities. eight healthy female subjects walked on a treadmill both normally and in crouch. in the crouch condition, subjects walked at three different walking speeds. 3d kinematic data were collected and muscle lengths and velocities were calculated using musculoskeletal modeling. it was found that voluntary walking in crouch resulted in shorter psoas length compared to normal, but not in shorter hamstrings length. moreover, crouch gait did not result in slower muscle lengthening velocities compared to normal gait. these results do not support the role of hamstrings shortness or spasticity in causing crouch gait. decreasing walking speed clearly reduced muscle lengths and lengthening velocities. therefore, patients with short or spastic muscles are more likely to respond by walking slower than by walking in crouch. also, differences in walking speed should be avoided as a confounding factor when comparing patient groups with controls. the purpose of this study was to characterize biomechanically three different crouch walking patterns, artificially induced in eight neurologically intact subjects and to compare them to selected cases of pathological crouch walking. the subjects were equipped with a lightweight mechanical exoskeleton with artificial muscles that acted in parallel with hamstrings and iliopsoas muscles. they walked at a speed of approximately 1m/s along the walkway under four experimental conditions: normal walking (nw), hamstrings contracture emulation (ham), iliopsoas contracture emulation (ips) and emulation of both hamstrings and iliopsoas contractures (ipsham). reflective markers and force platform data were collected and ankle, knee and hip-joint angles, moments and powers were calculated. ham and ipsham shifted ankle-angle rotation profiles into dorsiflexion during midstance compared to ips and nw where ankle-angle trajectories were similar. ham, ips and ipsham shifted the knee angle of rotation profiles into flexion during stance, compared to nw. ips and ipsham shifted hip angle of rotation profiles toward pronounced flexion while ham shifted hip angle of rotation profile toward extension, compared to nw. ham and ipsham significantly increased ankle moment during midstance, compared to ips and nw where ankle moment profiles were similar. all experimental conditions exhibited similar behavior in the knee-moment profiles during midstance while ips and ipsham knee-moment profiles exhibited significantly higher knee-extension moment during terminal stance and pre-swing. in the hip joint all experimental conditions exhibited similar shape of hip moment profiles throughout the gait cycle. ham and ips kinematic and kinetic patterns were qualitatively compared to two selected clinical cases, showing considerable similarity. this implies that distinct differences in kinematics and kinetics between ham, ips and ipsham may be clinically relevant in helping determine the relative contribution of hamstrings and iliopsoas muscles contractures to particular crouch walking.
backgroundaristolochic acid (aa) is a natural compound found in many plants of the aristolochia genus, and these plants are widely used in traditional medicines for numerous conditions and for weight loss. previous work has connected aa-mutagenesis to upper-tract urothelial cell carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. we hypothesize that aa may also contribute to bladder cancer.methodshere, we investigated the involvement of aa-mutagenesis in bladder cancer by sequencing bladder tumor genomes from two patients with known exposure to aa. after detecting strong mutational signatures of aa exposure in these tumors, we exome-sequenced and analyzed an additional 11 bladder tumors and analyzed publicly available somatic mutation data from a further 336 bladder tumors.resultsthe somatic mutations in the bladder tumors from the two patients with known aa exposure showed overwhelming aa signatures. we also detected evidence of aa exposure in 1 out of 11 bladder tumors from singapore and in 3 out of 99 bladder tumors from china. in addition, 1 out of 194 bladder tumors from north america showed a pattern of mutations that might have resulted from exposure to an unknown mutagen with a heretofore undescribed pattern of a > t mutations. besides the signature of aa exposure, the bladder tumors also showed the cpg > tpg and activated-apobec signatures, which have been previously reported in bladder cancer.conclusionsthis study demonstrates the utility of inferring mutagenic exposures from somatic mutation spectra. moreover, aa exposure in bladder cancer appears to be more pervasive in the east, where traditional herbal medicine is more widely used. more broadly, our results suggest that aa exposure is more extensive than previously thought both in terms of populations at risk and in terms of types of cancers involved. this appears to be an important public health issue that should be addressed by further investigation and by primary prevention through regulation and education. in addition to opportunities for primary prevention, knowledge of aa exposure would provide opportunities for secondary prevention in the form of intensified screening of patients with known or suspected aa exposure. all cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. the catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the apobec family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in dna maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. in addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, ‘kataegis’, is found in many cancer types. the results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.
previous experimental results have revealed that garlic (alium sativum) can reduce lead toxicity and tissue lead content in lead-exposed rodents. in the present study, the effects of different doses of allicin, the main active constituent of garlic, in reducing of organ and blood lead levels were evaluated in mice exposed to 1,000 ppm of lead acetate in drinking water. three groups of mice received allicin at doses of 12, 24, and 48 µg/kg orally (twice daily) during ongoing 14-day lead exposure. mice were killed on experimental day 15. allicin treatment reduced lead retention in blood and tissues. reduction of lead concentration in blood and tissues was dose dependent. with the highest dose of allicin, the greatest rate of reduction of lead concentrations were observed in liver (73.7%), kidney (45%), brain (45%), and bone (44.4%), respectively. liver zinc concentration was significantly reduced in all treated groups. it was concluded that allicin administered during lead exposure in mice can reduce tissue lead retention and, therefore, might have some therapeutic effect on lead poisoning. the very young are more prone to lead poisoning than adults, and the treatment with chelating agents, either as monotherapy or combined treatment, is still a matter of dispute. the purpose of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of three chelating agents administered either as monotherapies or as combined treatments in sucklings. lead acetate (5 mg pb kg−1 i.p.) was administered to the 7‐day‐old rat pups in eight litters on experimental day 1 and chelating agents on experimental days 2 and 3. pups were divided into six groups: (1) untreated control; (2) edta (calcium disodium ethylendiaminetetraacetate, 0.3 mmol kg−1 i.p. at 4 p.m.); (3) meso‐dmsa (meso‐2,3‐dimeracaptosuccinic acid, 0.5 mmol kg−1 p.o. at 10 a.m.); (4) rac‐dmsa (racemic‐2,3‐dimeracaptosuccinic acid, 0.5 mmol kg−1 p.o. at 10 a.m.); (5) edta+meso‐dmsa; and (6) edta+rac‐dmsa. rats were killed on experimental day 5. tissue element concentrations were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. treatment with edta did not affect tissue pb, but it reduced zn in the carcass and liver. meso‐dmsa reduced pb in the kidneys and brain, and it did not affect organ essential elements. rac‐dmsa most efficiently reduced pb concentrations in the carcass, kidneys and brain, but it also reduced zn and cu in the liver and zn in the kidneys. combined treatments with edta never improved the efficiency of either dmsa isoform in decreasing tissue pb but they did reduce tissue zn concentrations. all treatments caused the same decrease in the carcass ca concentrations. the results do not support combined treatment in this age group, which is especially sensitive to trace element deficiencies, and suggest that meso‐dmsa might be the treatment of choice in acute lead poisoning in infants. copyright © 1999 john wiley & sons, ltd.
objectivedetermine the changes in shoulder strength, shoulder range of motion, and arm volume in breast cancer patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb) or axillary lymph node dissection (alnd)methodsixty-eight slnb and 44 alnd patients were followed up from pre-surgery to 5 years after surgery. primary outcomes were the differences between affected and non-affected sides for the following: shoulder strength measured by dynamometry, shoulder range of motion measured by goniometry, and lymphedema measured by volume. as a secondary outcome, health-related quality of life (hrql) was assessed by the short form-36 health survey (sf-36) and the functional assessment of cancer therapy for breast cancer (fact-b+4) questionnaires. changes over time were tested for slnb and alnd using univariate repeated measures analysis of variance. generalized estimating equation models were constructed to assess the effect of slnb and alnd over time.resultsafter 5 years, the alnd group had significant loss of strength for internal rotators (1.39 kg, p = 0.001) and significant arm volume increase (132.45 ml, p = 0.031). the alnd group had a greater number of patients with clinically relevant internal rotator strength loss (38.7 vs. 13.6%, p = 0.012) and a greater number of lymphedema requiring treatment (33.3 vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001) than the slnb group. a loss of strength for shoulder external rotators, shoulder range of motion, and hrql in physical and arm domains persisted at 5 years in both slnb and alnd groups.conclusionthese results could help understand and plan the prevention, needs, and long-term care of breast cancer patients. background although numerous studies have shown that the status of the sentinel node is an accurate predictor of the status of the axillary nodes in breast cancer, the efficacy and safety of sentinel-node biopsy require validation.   methods from march 1998 to december 1999, we randomly assigned 516 patients with primary breast cancer in whom the tumor was less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter either to sentinel-node biopsy and total axillary dissection (the axillary-dissection group) or to sentinel-node biopsy followed by axillary dissection only if the sentinel node contained metastases (the sentinel-node group).   results the number of sentinel nodes found was the same in the two groups. a sentinel node was positive in 83 of the 257 patients in the axillary-dissection group (32.3 percent), and in 92 of the 259 patients in the sentinel-node group (35.5 percent). in the axillary-dissection group, the overall accuracy of the sentinel-node status was 96.9 percent, the sensitivity 91.2 percent, and the specificity 100 percent. there was less pain and better arm mobility in the patients who underwent sentinel-node biopsy only than in those who also underwent axillary dissection. there were 15 events associated with breast cancer in the axillary-dissection group and 10 such events in the sentinel-node group. among the 167 patients who did not undergo axillary dissection, there were no cases of overt axillary metastasis during follow-up.   conclusions sentinel-node biopsy is a safe and accurate method of screening the axillary nodes for metastasis in women with a small breast cancer.
aim to investigate and describe nurses' and midwives' physical health, rates of symptoms and disease, and to determine if these factors contribute to intention to leave.   background the nursing and midwifery workforce is ageing yet little is known about their physical health or its relationship to intention to leave.   methods an online survey of health and work-related assessments was distributed through the new south wales nurses and midwives association and professional contacts.   results nurses and midwives (n = 5041) reported good-very good health overall. with 22.2% intending to leave in the next 12 months, older age, better perceived health and job satisfaction, regional residence and not working shifts predicted no intention to leave while breathing problems predicted intention to leave.   conclusions study findings flag the importance of health as an influence on intention to leave. alongside job satisfaction and shift-working, health presents opportunities for workplace initiatives to maintain nurses in the workforce.   implications for nursing management educators, managers and policy makers should heed the significant influence of health for retention of staff and consider what strategies may mitigate health risks for this workforce. backgroundprevious studies on self-rated health among nurses have indicated an association of low job satisfaction and stress in relation to poor self-rated health. the relationship between self rated health and the specific work characteristics and health related behaviours of nurses to our knowledge have not been adequately studied.objectiveto investigate the health profile of nurses working in hospitals in north west greece and to examine the associations between self rated health (srh) and health related behaviours and work characteristics in this group of hospital employees.methodsa self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 443 nurses working in all the hospitals in north west greece. regression analysis was used to examine the relationship of health related behaviours and work characteristics with self rated health among the nurses.resultsa total of 353 responded to the questionnaire (response rate 80%) of which 311 (88%) were female and 42 (12%) male. the mean age (standard deviation) of the respondents was 36 years (5.6) and their mean years of working as nurses were 13.5 years (5.9). almost half of the nurses' smoked, and about one third were overweight or obese. about 58% (206) of the nurses reported having poor health while 42% (147) reported having good health. self-rated health was independently associated with gender, effort to avoid fatty foods and physical activity, according to multiple logistic regression analysis.conclusionthe population studied presented a relatively poor health profile, and a high proportion of poor srh. though female gender and effort to avoid fatty foods were associated with poor srh, and exercise and white meat consumption with good srh, specific work characteristics were not associated with srh.
purposeulnar and median nerve transfers to arm muscles have been used to recover elbow flexion in infants with neonatal brachial plexus palsy, but there is no direct outcome comparison with the classical supraclavicular nerve grafting approach.methodswe retrospectively analyzed patients with c5-c7 neonatal brachial plexus palsy submitted to nerve surgery and recorded elbow flexion recovery using the active movement scale (0–7) at 12 and 24 months after surgery. we compared 13 patients submitted to supraclavicular nerve grafting with 21 patients submitted to distal ulnar or median nerve transfer to biceps motor branch. we considered elbow flexion scores of 6 or 7 as good results.resultsthe mean elbow flexion score and the proportion of good results were better using distal nerve transfers than supraclavicular grafting at 12 months (p < 0.01), but not at 24 months. two patients with failed supraclavicular nerve grafting at 12 months showed good elbow flexion recovery after ulnar nerve transfers.conclusiondistal nerve transfers provided faster elbow flexion recovery than supraclavicular nerve grafting, but there was no significant difference in the outcome after 24 months of surgery. patients with failed supraclavicular grafting operated early can still benefit from late distal nerve transfers. supraclavicular nerve grafting should remain as the first line surgical treatment for children with neonatal brachial plexus palsy. summary: obstetrical brachial plexus palsy is commonly attributed to excessive traction applied to the baby’s neck during a difficult delivery. the majority of infants with brachial plexus palsy recover spontaneously within the first 3 months of life. however, in 10 to 30 percent of cases, the recovery is incomplete. global palsy and the absence of biceps muscle function at 3 months of age have been adopted as the main indications for early brachial plexus microsurgery. in late cases or when primary reconstruction has not yielded satisfactory results, secondary reconstruction will intervene as an enhancement of a specific functional deficit or of the overall function of the upper extremity. in this article, the authors review the history of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy, the epidemiology and cause, and the indications for and the timing of surgery. the current diagnostic modalities and clinical evaluation of plexus injuries are also considered. the advances in electrophysiology, myelography, and computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging are presented, all of which are important diagnostic modalities that facilitate a more accurate diagnosis. obstetrical brachial plexus injuries may require multistaged reconstructive procedures, including neurolysis, resection of neuromas, identification of intraplexus and extraplexus donor nerves, selective neurotizations, selective nerve transfers, and nerve grafting. finally, the various secondary procedures in terms of anatomical location in the upper extremity are described. whatever the reports and results, the complex doctrine of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy continues to evolve with notable functional outcomes, but return to normal function remains a challenge for the future.

study objective hypotension frequently occurs during spinal anesthesia (sa), especially in the elderly. phenylephrine is effective to prevent sa-induced hypotension during cesarean delivery. the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine after sa for orthopedic surgery in the elderly.   design this prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study included 54 patients older than 60 years undergoing elective lower limb surgery under sa (injection of 10 mg of isobaric bupivacaine with 5 μg of sufentanyl).   intervention patients were randomized to group p (100-μg/ml solution of phenylephrine solution at 1 ml/min after placement of sa) or the control group c (0.9% isotonic sodium chloride solution). the flow of the infusion was stopped if the mean arterial blood pressure (map) was higher than the baseline map and maintained or restarted at 1 ml/min if map was equal to or lower than the baseline map. heart rate and map were collected throughout the case.   measurements hypotension was defined by a 20% decrease and hypertension as a 20% increase from baseline map. bradycardia was defined as a heart rate lower than 50 beats per minute.   main results twenty-eight patients were randomized to group p and 26 patients to group c. map was higher in group p than in group c (92 ± 2 vs 82 ± 2 mm hg, mean ± sd, p< .001). the number of hypotensive episodes per patient was higher in group c compared with group p (9 [0-39] vs 1 [0-10], median [extremes], p< .01), but the number of hypotensive patients was similar between groups (19 [73%] vs 20 [71%], p= 1). the time to onset of the first hypotension was shorter in group c (3 [1-13] vs 15 [1-95] minutes, p= .004). the proportion of patients without hypotension (cumulative survival) was better in group p (p= .04). the number of hypertensive episodes per patient and the number of bradycardic episodes per patient were similar between groups (p= not significant).   conclusion prophylactic phenylephrine infusion is an effective method of reducing sa-induced hypotension in the elderly. compared with a control group, it delays the time to onset of hypotension and decreases the number of hypotensive episodes per patient. more data are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes of such a strategy. unlabelled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we evaluated the effect of prophylactic im phenylephrine at doses of 1.5 and 3 mg on hyperbaric tetracaine spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in 90 normotensive and hypertensive patients aged >65 yr undergoing surgery for hip fracture. thirty normotensive patients received 1.5 or 3 mg of phenylephrine im (n/p-1.5 and n/p-3.0 groups; n = 15 in each), whereas controls received saline (n/c group; n = 15), and 45 hypertensive patients were treated in a similar manner (h/p-1.5, h/p-3.0, and h/c groups; n = 15 in each). all groups had a peak sensory block height of t9, with a range of t8 to t10. the incidence of hypotension (>25% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure [map] from baseline) was significantly lower in the patients who received phenylephrine 1.5 or 3 mg than in the controls, both in the normotensive and hypertensive groups (p < 0.01). the n/p-3.0 and n/p-1.5 groups and the h/p-3.0 group had significantly lower percentage reductions in map (p < 0.05) and required significantly smaller doses of rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05) than did the n/c group or the h/c group. the h/p-1.5 group also required significantly less rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05), although it was not sufficient to significantly attenuate the percentage decrease in map compared with that in the h/c group. bradycardia (heart rate <50 bpm) as an adverse effect after im administration of phenylephrine was not observed in any of the groups. hypertension (map >20% increase from baseline) after medication occurred in the n/p-3.0 and h/p-3.0 groups, but not in the n/p-1.5 and h/p-1.5 groups. we conclude that prophylactic im injection of 1.5 mg of phenylephrine is a safe (defined as the inhibition of bradycardia and hypertension) and effective means of reducing the incidence of hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients.   implications we evaluated the efficacy and safety of small-dose im phenylephrine for prophylaxis against spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients. phenylephrine 1.5 mg im was effective for reducing the incidence of hypotension and avoided adverse effects.
background temporomandibular disorder (tmd) represents a subgroup of painful orofacial disorders involving pain in the temporomandibular joint (tmj) region, fatigue of the cranio-cervico-facial muscles (especially masticatory muscles), limitation of mandible movement, and the presence of a clicking sound in the tmj. tmd is associated with multiple factors and systemic diseases. this study aimed to assess the prevalence of tmd in nepalese subjects for the first time. methods a total of 500 medical and dental students (127 men and 373 women) participated in this study from may 2016 to september 2016. the fonseca questionnaire was used as a tool to evaluate the prevalence of tmd, and fonseca's anamnestic index (fai) was used to classify the severity of tmd. results the majority of the participants with tmd had a history of head trauma, psychological stress, and dental treatment or dental problems. the prevalence of tmd in nepalese students was mild to moderate. conclusions the prevalence of tmd in nepalese subjects was mild to moderate. the majority of the study subjects had eyesight problems, history of head trauma, psychological stress, and drinking alcohol and had received dental treatments. purpose several clinical studies suggest that psychologic factors may play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of temporomandibular disorder (tmd) signs and symptoms. the goal of this study was to verify the prevalence of anxiety and depression in adolescents, and their relationship with signs and symptoms of tmd.   materials and methods the sample comprised 217 nonpatient adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. the subjective symptoms and clinical signs of tmd were evaluated, respectively, using a self-report questionnaire and the craniomandibular index (cmi, which has 2 subscales), the dysfunction index, and the palpation index. the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), a 14-item self-administered rating scale that was developed specifically to identify anxiety and depression in nonpsychiatric medical outpatients, assessed levels of anxiety and depression.   results in the total sample, anxiety and depression were present in 16.58% and 26.71% of subjects, respectively, including all levels of hads. the results showed that there were positive correlations between cmi and palpation index and anxiety (hadsa) (p < .01) but not with depression (hadsd). an association between the number of tmd subjective symptoms and hadsa/hadsd was found (p < .01).   conclusion anxiety and depression, although of mild intensity, are common in adolescents. in this study both hadsa and hadsd were associated with an increasing number of tmd subjective symptoms. however, only anxiety was correlated with clinical signs of tmd (cmi), primarily muscle tenderness (palpation index).
positron emission tomography (pet) plays an important role in neurodegenerative disorder diagnosis and neurooncology applications, especially detecting the early metabolism anomalies in human brains. current lesion detection algorithms can be roughly classified into voxel-based, region of interest (roi)-based, and global algorithms. these methods may capture the scale and/or location of the lesions in brain, but other important properties, such as lesion metabolism rate and contrast to non-lesion parts are often ignored. to capture these important features, we propose a novel lesion detector with three lesion-centric feature descriptors for brain pet. we analyze the lesion patterns of 331 pet datasets from the adni baseline cohort and further perform t-test between different disorder groups to validate the new lesion-centric features. the preliminary results show that the proposed lesion detector is robust in capturing the brain lesions and has a great potential to be a predictive biomarker for neurological disorders. pattern classification methods have been widely studied for analysis of brain images to decode the disease states, such as diagnosis of alzheimer's disease (ad). most existing methods aimed to extract discriminative features from neuroimaging data and then build a supervised classifier for classification. however, due to the rich imaging features and small sample size of neuroimaging data, it is still challenging to make use of features to achieve good classification performance. in this paper, we propose a hierarchical ensemble classification algorithm to gradually combine the features and decisions into a unified model for more accurate classification. specifically, a number of low-level classifiers are first built to transform the rich imaging and correlation-context features of brain image into more compact high-level features with supervised learning. then, multiple high-level classifiers are generated, with each evaluating the high-level features of different brain regions. finally, all high-level classifiers are combined to make final decision. our method is evaluated using mr brain images on 427 subjects (including 198 ad patients and 229 normal controls) from alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (adni) database. experimental results show that our method achieves an accuracy of 92.04% and an auc (area under the roc curve) of 0.9518 for ad classification, demonstrating very promising classification performance.
this study assessed the effect of quercetin (qe) on cadmium chloride (cdcl2) - induced testicular toxicity, as well as the effect of withdrawal of cdcl2 treatment on same. thirty male wistar rats aged 10 weeks old and weighing 270-300g were assigned into 5 groups and used for this study. rats in groups 1-4 were administered vehicle, cdcl2 (5mg/kg bwt), cdcl2+qe (5mg/kg bwt and 20mg/kg bwt, respectively) or qe (20mg/kg bwt) orally for 4 weeks. group 5 rats received cdcl2, with 4 weeks recovery period. results showed that cadmium accumulated in serum, testis and epididymis, decreased body weight, testicular and epididymal weights, sperm count, motility and viability. cadmium decreased serum concentrations of reproductive hormones, but increased testicular glucose, lactate and lactate dehydrogenase activity. cadmium decreased testicular enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and non-enzymatic (glutathione, vitamins c and e) antioxidants, and increased malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide. cadmium down-regulated bcl-2 protein, up-regulated bax protein, increased bax/bcl-2 ratio and cleaved caspase-3 activity. histopathology of the testis showed decreased johnsen's score and leydig cell count. these negative effects were attenuated by qe administration, while withdrawal of cdcl2 did not appreciably reverse toxicity. we conclude that qe better protected the testis from cdcl2 toxicity than withdrawal of cdcl2 administration. although it is well known that cadmium (cd) causes adverse effects on male rat reproductive organs, few studies have quantified alterations caused by its low doses. quantification of these alterations, especially in the testis, was measured using morphometry. a single dose of cadmium chloride (1 or 1.2 mg/kg bw) was injected i.p. in adult rats, killed after 7 or 56 days. the lower dose caused slight alterations as measured by morphometrical analysis. the higher dose caused significant reduction in testis and epididymis weight, gonadossomatic index and length of seminiferous tubule (st) after 7 and 56 days. cadmium significantly reduced the st diameter after 56 days. decreased volume density of st, after 7 and 56 days, was accompanied by an increase in interstitium volume density. the damage caused by the dose of 1.2 mg/kg can be clearly observed with light microscope. after 7 days, the tubule lumens were filled with degenerated germ cells and multinucleated spermatid aggregates. vacuolization of the seminiferous epithelium was also observed. after 56 days, increased damage resulted in vacuolated st, consisting only of sertoli cells. scanning electron microscopy examination of the testis showed that, in the group cadmium treated (1.2 mg/kg) and killed after 56 days, the interstitial tissue presents a compact and fibrous appearance with absence of fenestrae. the seminiferous epithelium height diminished and the absence of spermatozoa can be noted. the results show that a very small difference of cd dose causes a sudden increase in testicular damage, apparently overpowering this tissue’s natural defences.
abstract the release of so42–-s, k+, ca2+ and mg2+ from soil amended with spent mushroom compost (smc), a byproduct of mushroom production, was measured in leachate from field lysimeters for 30 weeks. rates of application were 0 and 80 t ha–1 moist smc. the smc contained 1.7% k, 6.5% ca, 0.4% mg and 1.2% s (of which 87% is so42–-s), and has a c : s ratio of 26. the break-through curves of ion leaching were polymodal indicating the preservation of soil structure in the lysimeters and its influence on leaching. so42–-s release from smc was rapid (first-order exponential) and was very similar to the release from a laboratory incubation. the release of k+, ca2+ and mg2+ was described using first/zero-order models which were also used to describe their release in the laboratory. the rate and amount of ca2+ release was similar in the field and laboratory, but the amount of k+ (and to a lesser extent mg2+) release was less in the field than in the laboratory. recoveries of smc applied nutrients in leachate were 80% of s (263 kg ha–1), 3% of k (14 kg ha–1), 16% of ca (284 kg ha–1) and 37% of mg (40 kg ha–1). little if any s was mineralised. using smc could provide plants with s, k, ca and mg but there is potential for so42–-s losses via leaching. abstract the release of sulphate-sulphur (so42–-s), potassium (k), calcium (ca) and magnesium (mg) from soil amended with spent mushroom compost (smc), a by-product of mushroom production, was measured for 16 weeks in an open laboratory incubation at 25°c. rates of application were up to 80 t ha–1 moist smc (0.84% smc dry weight) both with and without inorganic fertilizer. the rates of nutrient application in the inorganic fertilizer were: 338 kg ha–1 n, 100 kg ha–1 of both phosphorus and k, and 114 kg ha–1 s. smc contains 1.7% k, 6.5% ca, 0.4% mg and 1.2% s (of which 87% is inorganic), and has a carbon:sulphur ratio of 26. the release of so42–-s was rapid, and was described using either a first or mixed order exponential equation, or (underestimated) by the century model. the release of k, ca and mg was initially rapid (first order) and then declined to a constant rate (zero order). their release was also described using first/first order or first order/parabolic diffusion equations. model parameters indicated the relative sizes of both readily releasable and recalcitrant nutrient pools. the recovery of smc-supplied nutrients in the absence of fertilizer was 75–83% of the s, 40–45% of the k, 14–20% of the ca and 43–66% of the mg. when fertilizer was applied 33–45% of the s, 22–36% of the k, 12–24% of the ca and –4 to 20% of the mg that were supplied by the smc and fertilizer were recovered in the leachate. the generally lower nutrient recovery when fertilizer was applied could have resulted from the incomplete recovery of fertilizer s and k, from soil fixation of applied nutrients, and from the lower ph following fertilizer application.
objective altered micrornas (mirnas) expression has been found in many cancer types, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (lscc). the aim of this study was to determine the role and clinical value of three lscc-related mirs, such as mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p in a homogeneous cohort of patients with primary lscc treated by primary surgery. methods expression levels of mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p were detected in 43 pairs of lscc and adjacent normal tissues by reverse-transcription quantitative pcr. overall survival and disease-free survival were evaluated using the kaplan–meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed using the cox proportional hazard analysis. results mir-21-5p is significantly upregulated, while mir-let-7a is significantly downregulated in lscc tumor tissues compared with the corresponding adjacent normal tissues. the downregulation of mir-34c-5p expression significantly correlated with a shorter disease-free survival and, in the multivariate analysis, low mir-34c-5p expression was associated with an increased risk of recurrence. conclusions mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p seem to play a critical role in lscc carcinogenesis and might have a diagnostic and prognostic clinical value. the mir-let-7a levels could have a predictive role for lymph node metastases and mir-34c-5p might be a promising biomarker of patient outcome. in this study, we report for the first time reduced expression of the let-7 microrna in human lung cancers. interestingly, 143 lung cancer cases that had undergone potentially curative resection could be classified into two major groups according to let-7 expression in unsupervised hierarchical analysis, showing significantly shorter survival after potentially curative resection in cases with reduced let-7 expression (p = 0.0003). multivariate cox regression analysis showed this prognostic impact to be independent of disease stage (hazard ratio = 2.17; p = 0.009). in addition, overexpression of let-7 in a549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line inhibited lung cancer cell growth in vitro. this study represents the first report of reduced expression of let-7 and the potential clinical and biological effects of such a microrna alteration.
the purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of fatigue on the response of the trunk to various combinations of initial static loads and step inputed loads causing rapid sagittal trunk flexion. when attempting to overcome the moments associated with sudden loading, the spine maintains stabilty by increasing joint compression forces (cholewicki & mcgill, 1996) and increasing the level of muscle coactivation, even if it may result in an increased rate of fatigue (zetterberg et al., 1987). in a study that determined the response of the spine to sudden loads causing sagittal flexion, it was found that abdominal muscles rapidly responded to the sudden load with a large increase in muscle activation (krajcarski et al., 1999). also, krajcarski et al. concluded that increases in emg amplitudes of abdominal and trunk extensor muscles were determined predominantly by the added load magnitude and not the pre-loads. chiang (in press) conducted a similar study with the difference being the trunk motion investigated was lateral bend instead of trunk flexion. similar to krajcarski et al. (1999), chiang (in press) concluded that increased muscular activity due to pre-loads leads to increases in trunk muscle stiffness and spine stability. krajcarski et al (1999) and chiang (in press) have provided a greater understanding of the active muscular response that is responsible for maintaining stability. these two studies have demonstrated that a greater preload will result in an increase in trunk stiffness, which is beneficial to the stability of the spine when exposed to sudden loads. unfortunately, the increased trunk stiffness also contributes to trunk muscle fatigue because an increase in muscular activity is what causes the increased stiffness of the trunk. since, muscle fatigue has an effect on the ability of the spine to maintain stability, it would be of significant interest to determine whether a fatigued trunk system responds differently to the preand added loads that were described by krajcarski et al (1999). objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
to determine the accuracy of the 50‐g glucose challenge test (gct) in detecting hyperglycemia in pregnancy (hip) across a range of glucose thresholds relative to the international association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups diagnostic criteria, and to determine the accuracy of the 50‐g gct among patients with different risk status. background a 50-g oral glucose challenge test (ogct) is a widely accepted screening method for gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), but other options are being considered.   purpose to systematically review the test characteristics of various screening methods for gdm across a range of recommended diagnostic glucose thresholds.   data sources 15 electronic databases from 1995 to may 2012, reference lists, web sites of relevant organizations, and gray literature.   study selection two reviewers independently identified english-language prospective studies that compared any screening test for gdm with any reference standard.   data extraction one reviewer extracted and a second reviewer verified data from 51 cohort studies. two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality.   data synthesis the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for the ogct at a threshold of 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) were 70% to 88%, 69% to 89%, 2.6 to 6.5, and 0.16 to 0.33, respectively. at a threshold of 7.2 mmol/l (130 mg/dl), the test characteristics were 88% to 99%, 66% to 77%, 2.7 to 4.2, and 0.02 to 0.14, respectively. for a fasting plasma glucose threshold of 4.7 mmol/l (85 mg/dl), they were 87%, 52%, 1.8, and 0.25, respectively. glycated hemoglobin level had poorer test characteristics than fasting plasma glucose level or the ogct. no studies compared the ogct with international association of the diabetes and pregnancy study groups (iadpsg) diagnostic criteria.   limitations the lack of a gold standard for confirming gdm limits comparisons. few data exist for screening tests before 24 weeks' gestation.   conclusion the ogct and fasting plasma glucose level (at a threshold of 4.7 mmol/l [85 mg/dl]) by 24 weeks' gestation are good at identifying women who do not have gdm. the ogct is better at identifying women who have gdm. the ogct has not been validated for the iadpsg diagnostic criteria.
macroinvertebrate community taxonomic and trait structure showed consistent differences between riffles and pools across 12 headwater streams in the sierra nevada (california) even as flows varied from wet to dry years and between seasons. densities of ephemeroptera, plecoptera, trichoptera, elmidae, orthocladiinae and diamesinae midges, and mites were greater in riffles, whereas tanypodinae, chironominae, sialis, and pisidium were more abundant in pools. pools had higher densities but estimated biomass was greater in riffles. collector-gatherer and micropredator abundances were greater in pools whereas grazers, collector-filterers, and macropredators were more abundant in riffles. stonefly shredders were most abundant in riffles but some caddis shredders were more abundant in pools. trait state patterns were related to food resource and physical habitat differences between riffles and pools. of the distinct pool–riffle differences we found among taxa, only about half conformed to expectations from the literature. pool and riffle assemblages were most dissimilar at intermediate discharge and converged at low and high flows when one or the other habitat dominated. bioassessment sampling will need to account for these flow-related differences. benthic invertebrate communities in these mountain streams clearly differ between pools and riffles, but the relative extent of habitats and biological similarity shift with flow regime. ........................................................................................................................................
seed micromorphology of 24 taxa of the genera anacamptis and orchis was examined under light and scanning electron microscopy. seed qualitative characters appear very useful at the supraspecific level in the subtribe orchidinae. based on our observations, the sculpturing of the periclinal walls of the medial testa cells, the seed shape and several features of the anticlinal walls of the apical cells showed variability between the studied taxa, with special relevance of the first character. according to this factor, we found one type of seed for anacamptis and two for orchis. the taxonomic value of seed coat characters is compared with the last taxonomic proposals for the genera anacamptis and orchis. turtles are one of earth's most instantly recognizable life forms, distinguished for over 200 million years in the fossil record. even so, key nodes in the phylogeny of turtles remain uncertain. to address this issue, we sequenced >90% of the nuclear recombination activase gene 1 (rag-1) for 24 species representing all modern turtle families. rag-1 exhibited negligible saturation and base composition bias, and extensive base composition homogeneity. most of the relationships suggested by prior phylogenetic analyses were also supported by rag-1 and, for at least two critical nodes, with a much higher level of support. rag-1 also indicates that the enigmatic platysternidae and chelydridae, often considered sister taxa based on morphological evidence, are not closely related, although their precise phylogenetic placement in the turtle tree is still unresolved. although rag-1 is phylogenetically informative, our research revealed fundamental conflicts among analytical methods for estimating phylogenetic hypotheses. maximum parsimony analyses of rag-1 alone and in combination with two mitochondrial genes suggest the earliest phylogenetic splits separating into three basal branches, the pig-nosed turtles (carettochelyidae), the softshell turtles (trionychidae), and a clade comprising all remaining extant turtles. maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses group carettochelyidae and trionychidae (=trionychoidae) in their more traditional location as the sister taxon to all other hidden-necked turtles, collectively forming the cryptodira. our research highlights the utility of molecular data in identifying issues of character homology in morphological datasets, while shedding valuable light on the biodiversity of a globally imperiled taxon.
abstract the espf protein is secreted by the type iii secretion system of enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (epec and ehec, respectively). espf sequences differ between ehec o157:h7, ehec o26:h11, and epec o127:h6 in terms of the number of sh3-binding polyproline-rich repeats and specific residues in these regions, as well as residues in the amino domain involved in cellular localization. espfo127 is important for the inhibition of phagocytosis by epec and also limits epec translocation through antigen-sampling cells (m cells). espfo127 has been shown to have effects on cellular organelle function and interacts with several host proteins, including n-wasp and sorting nexin 9 (snx9). in this study, we compared the capacities of different espf alleles to inhibit (i) bacterial phagocytosis by macrophages, (ii) translocation through an m-cell coculture system, and (iii) uptake by and translocation through cultured bovine epithelial cells. the espf gene from e. coli serotype o157 (espf o157) allele was significantly less effective at inhibiting phagocytosis and also had reduced capacity to inhibit e. coli translocation through a human-derived in vitro m-cell coculture system in comparison to espf o127 and espf o26. in contrast, espf o157 was the most effective allele at restricting bacterial uptake into and translocation through primary epithelial cells cultured from the bovine terminal rectum, the predominant colonization site of ehec o157 in cattle and a site containing m-like cells. although lumier binding assays demonstrated differences in the interactions of the espf variants with snx9 and n-wasp, we propose that other, as-yet-uncharacterized interactions contribute to the host-based variation in espf activity demonstrated here. the epithelium that lines the gut is impermeable to macromolecules and microorganisms, except in peyer's patches (pps), where the lymphoid follicle-associated epithelium (fae) contains m cells that transport antigens and microorganisms. a cultured system that reproduces the main characteristics of fae and m cells was established by cultivation of pp lymphocytes with the differentiated human intestinal cell line caco-2. lymphocytes settled into the epithelial monolayer, inducing reorganization of the brush border and a temperature-dependent transport of particles and vibrio cholerae. this model system could prove useful for intestinal physiology, vaccine research, and drug delivery studies.
purpose and hypothesisimprovements in pain, function and sports activity are the main goals of patients following total knee arthroplasty (tka). participation in sports has become an increasingly important contributor to patients’ quality of life (qol). hiking is one of the most popular summer activities among elderly people in alpine regions. consequently, this randomized controlled trial investigates the impact of a 3-month guided hiking programme on patients’ functional abilities and qol following tka. it was hypothesized that patients who participate in this programme would demonstrate improvements in functional and qol parameters compared with a control group.methodsforty-eight tka patients were included and randomized into either the intervention group (ig; n = 25) or the control group (cg; n = 23). the ig participated in a 3-month hiking programme (2–3 times a week), whereas the cg performed activities of daily living. the stair climb test (sct), qol questionnaires and isokinetic force measurements were completed at three time points (i.e. pre-test, post-test, retention-test). anovas for repeated measurements were conducted for the sct results. the friedman test and the mann–whitney u test were performed for the qol parameters.resultsafter the 3-month hiking programme, the ig achieved faster overall walking times on the sct. the time decreased from 4.3 ± 0.6 s (pre-test) to 3.6 ± 0.4 s (post-test) for the stair ascent (p = 0.060) and from 3.6 ± 0.6 s (pre-test) to 3.2 ± 0.5 s (post-test) for the stair descent (p = 0.036). the ig showed significant improvement on some of the subscales of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score from pre-test to retention-test (p < 0.01). in the cg, no significant changes were observed (n.s.).conclusionsthe results indicate moderate improvement in the functional abilities and qol of tka patients who participated in a 3-month guided hiking programme compared with the patients in the cg. hiking did not have any acute detrimental effects on the tka patients during this study period.level of evidenceii. objective to study the validity and feasibility of a computerized version of the western ontario and mcmaster universities (womac) osteoarthritis index.   methods thirty patients with osteoarthritis (oa) of the knee completed both a paper and a computerized version of womac in random order. the visual analog scaled version of womac, va3.0, was used. we studied criterion validity by comparing the paper and computerized versions.   results all patients completed the computerized version without undue difficulty. criterion validity, based on aggregated subscale scores, was excellent: pain, icc = 0.89, stiffness, icc = 0.87, physical function, icc = 0.95.   conclusion the computerized version of womac va3.0 is a valid alternative to the paper version.
adolescent binge drinking is a public health challenge. the study analyzes data from add health, a longitudinal survey of seventh through eleventh grade students enrolled between 1995 and 1996. a stochastic actor-based model simulates the co-evolution of binge drinking and friendship connections. selection effects play a significant role in the creation of peer clusters with similar binge drinking. friendship nominations between two students with similar binge drinking frequency were 3.46 (95% ci: 2.38-5.01) times more likely than between otherwise identical students with differing alcohol use frequency. an adolescent who nominated binge drinkers as friends was 14% more likely to begin binge drinking than adolescents with non-binge drinking friends. the data demonstrate that strong family ties reduced the odds of adolescent binge drinking by 7%. objective similarity in alcohol consumption among adolescent friends could be caused by the influence of friends or by the selection of friends who consume similar levels of alcohol. this article aims to disentangle influence and selection processes while specifically examining changes over time in these processes and possible differences between reciprocal and nonreciprocal friendships.   method the design was longitudinal with four observations (time 1-time 4 [t1-t4]). data consisted of a longitudinal sample of 1,204 finnish adolescents in 10 junior high schools. the main measurements were adolescents' friendship networks and alcohol consumption. for three successive periods, t1-t2, t2-t3, and t3-t4, actor-based models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior were analyzed (mage: t1 = 13.6 years, t2 = 14.6 years, t3 = 15.6 years, t4 = 16.1 years).   results selection, as well as influence processes, played an important role in adolescent alcohol consumption. influence was found during the first period (t1-t2), whereas support for selection was found during the last two periods (t2-t3 and t3-t4). the strength of influence and selection processes did not differ for reciprocal and nonreciprocal friendships.   conclusions the impact of selection and influence processes changed over time such that influence was only present during early adolescence, whereas selection was present during mid-adolescence. during early adolescence, youngsters would benefit from learning to resist social influence. alcohol-consumption prevention programs targeting mid-adolescence should consider peer selection processes. these findings stress the importance of considering changes over time in future practice and research.
in light of the current modifications presented in the diagnostic criteria of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) in the dsm 5, this study aimed at revalidating well‐known ptsd risk factors, including gender, peritraumatic dissociation, social support, level of threat, and trait tendency for forgiveness. background the impact on individual survivors of human rights abuses of testifying before south africa's truth and reconciliation commission (trc) has not been established.   aims to examine the degree to which participation in the trc is related to current psychiatric status and forgiveness among survivors.   method survivors (n=134) who gave public, closed or no testimony to the trc completed instruments measuring exposure to human rights abuses, exposure to other traumatic events, current psychiatric status and forgiveness attitudes towards the perpetrator(s).   results there was no significant association between trc participation and current psychiatric status or current forgiveness attitudes, and low forgiveness was associated with poorer psychiatric health.   conclusions truth commissions should form part of, rather than be a substitute for, comprehensive therapeutic interventions for survivors of human rights abuses. lack of forgiveness may be an important predictor of psychiatric risk in this population.
backgroundnon-starch polysaccharide enzymes (nspes) have long been used in monogastric animal feed production to degrade non-starch polysaccharides (nsps) to oligosaccharides in order to promote growth performance and gastrointestinal (gi) tract health. however, the precise molecular mechanism of nspes in the improvement of the mammalian small intestine remains unknown.methodsin this study, isobaric tags were applied to investigate alterations of the small intestinal mucosa proteome of growing pigs after 50 days of supplementation with 0.6% nspes (mixture of xylanase, β-glucanase and cellulose) in the diet. bioinformatics analysis including gene ontology annotation was performed to determine the differentially expressed proteins. a protein fold-change of ≥ 1.2 and a p-value of < 0.05 were selected as thresholds.resultsdietary supplementation of nspes improved the growth performance of growing pigs. most importantly, a total of 90 proteins were found to be differentially abundant in the small intestinal mucosa between a control group and the nspe group. up-regulated proteins were related to nutrient metabolism (energy, lipids, protein and mineral), immunity, redox homeostasis, detoxification and the cell cytoskeleton. down-regulated proteins were primarily related to transcriptional and translational regulation. our results indicate that the effect of nspes on the increase of nutrient availability in the intestinal lumen facilitates the efficiency of nutrient absorption and utilization, and the supplementation of nspes in growing pigs also modulates redox homeostasis and enhances immune response during simulating energy metabolism due to a higher uptake of nutrients in the small intestine.conclusionsthese findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of nspes on the small intestine of pigs, which provides new information for the better utilization of this feed additive in the future. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) infection results in fluid and electrolyte losses in the small intestine. we investigated the effect of non-starch polysaccharides (nsp) hydrolysis products of wheat middlings (wm) and flaxseed (fs) on net absorption of fluid and solutes during etec challenge. products were generated by incubating wm and fs with a blend of carbohydrase enzymes to produce 2 products: 80% ethanol-soluble (es) and 80% ethanol-insoluble (ei) which were studied in 2 experiments in which 2 factors were investigated: products (ei vs. es) and time of etec challenge (before vs. after perfusion). pairs of small-intestine segments, one non-challenged and the other etec-challenged were perfused with products for 7.5 h. etec reduced fluid absorption by more than 380 microl/cm(2) in saline (control) perfused segments, whereas this reduction was significantly (p < 0.05) less for the wm and fs products. interaction (p > 0.05) between product and time of challenge was not observed. for wm, products effects on etec-challenged segments were such that perfusion of es resulted in higher total solute (measured as osmolality) absorption than ei (138 vs. 103 microosmol/cm(2)). in conclusion, hydrolysis products from wm and fs were beneficial in maintaining fluid balance during etec challenge, suggesting potential in controlling etec induced diarrhea in piglets.
currently, there are no standardized, objective, and clinically applicable methods to predict the outcome of pulsed dye laser (pdl) therapy on capillary vascular malformation (cvm) patients. the introduction of a method that can predict the outcome prior to treatment will be valuable for both the patients and the doctors. in this study, the authors treated cvm with 595-nm wavelength pdl in chinese patients (n = 686) and analyzed the efficacy of treatment and complications retrospectively in a 5-year period. nearly 18 % of patients (n = 122) had 76 % or more clearing of lesions; over 52 % of patients (n = 360) had more than 50 % of clearing. the lesions in head and neck region had the best effective rate (58.3 %), followed by trunk (42.9 %) and extremities (35.6 %). the efficacy of pdl therapy is related to age, type, and location of lesions. fifty-seven patients (8.3 %) had complications, including 2.0 % blistering (n = 14), 4.5 % hyperpigmentation (n = 31), 1.3 % hypopigmentation (n = 9), and 0.4 % hypertrophic scarring (n = 3). based on these preliminary data, the authors established a standardized, objective, and clinically applicable equation that may be applied to predict the efficacy of 595 nm pdl therapy on a newly diagnosed chinese cvm patients based on the age, type, and location of lesions. forty-three children with 49 separate port-wine stain vascular malformations were treated with the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser at 585 nm. the patients ranged in age from 2 weeks to 14 years. overall, 16% of patients had more than 95% resolution of their port-wine stains after an average of 4.8 (1 to 11) treatments. there was an average improvement of 69% in those lesions not clearing completely (average of 3.7 treatments). lesions in patients less than 4 years of age were almost twice as likely to clear than were those in older children (20% vs 12%), and in fewer treatments (3.8 vs 6.5). an approximate 50% clearing was obtained with one treatment. subsequent treatments resulted in an additional 10% clearing. there were no episodes of scarring or persistent pigmentary changes in any of the patients. lesions on the hand and arm responded less well than lesions on the face, neck, and torso. the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser has proved to be a safe and effective treatment modality for port-wine stain capillary malformations in infants and children.
iodine is the main constituent of thyroid hormones, which in turn are required for fetal brain development. however, the relation between iodine intake during pregnancy, thyroid function, and child neurodevelopment needs further evaluation. the authors assessed the association of maternal iodine intake from diet and supplements during pregnancy and of maternal and neonatal thyroid function with infant neurodevelopment. the mental development index and psychomotor development index (pdi) for 691 children were obtained between 2005 and 2007 using the bayley scales of infant development at age 1 year in a prebirth cohort in valencia, spain. in multivariate analyses, a maternal thyrotropin level >4 μu/ml was associated with an increased risk of a pdi <85 (odds ratio = 3.5, p = 0.02). maternal intake of ≥150 μg/day, compared with <100 μg/day, of iodine from supplements was associated with a 5.2-point decrease in pdi (95% confidence interval: -8.1, -2.2) and a 1.8-fold increase in the odds of a pdi <85 (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 3.3). when analyses were stratified by sex, this association was intensified for girls but was not observed for boys. further evidence on the safety and effectiveness of iodine supplementation during pregnancy is needed before it is systematically recommended in iodine-sufficient or mildly deficient areas. context thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development. limited data are available regarding whether thyroid function in neonates influences later cognitive development.   objective our objective was to study associations of newborn t4 levels with maternal thyroid function and childhood cognition.   design and setting we studied participants in project viva, a cohort study in massachusetts.   participants we studied a total of 500 children born 1999--2003 at 34 wk or more.   main outcome measures we determined cognitive test scores at ages 6 months and 3 yr.   results mean newborn t4 at a mean age of 1.94 d was 17.6 (sd 4.0) microg/dl, and levels were higher in girls [1.07 microg/dl; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.38, 1.76] and infants born after longer gestation (0.42 microg/dl; 95% ci 0.17, 0.67 per wk). newborn t4 levels were not associated with maternal t4, tsh, or thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. on multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, higher newborn t4 was unexpectedly associated with poorer scores on the visual recognition memory test among infants at age 6 months (-0.5; 95% ci -0.9, -0.2), but not with scores at age 3 yr on either the peabody picture vocabulary test (0.2; 95% ci -0.1, 0.5) or the wide range assessment of visual motor abilities (0.1; 95% ci -0.2, 0.3). maternal thyroid function test results were not associated with child cognitive test scores.   conclusions newborn t4 concentrations within a normal physiological reference range are not associated with maternal thyroid function and do not predict cognitive outcome in a population living in an iodine-sufficient area.
objectiveto investigate the effects of huaiqihuang granules (槐杞黄颗粒, hqh), a mixture of chinese herbs including trametes robiniophila murr, fructus lycii and polygonatum sibiricum, on adriamycininduced nephropathy (adrn) in rats and its underlying mechanisms.methodsrats with adrn were divided into four groups: the sham group, the model group (distilled water), the low-dose hqh-treated (2 g/kg) group, and the high-dose hqh-treated (4 g/kg) group. body weight and 24-h urinary protein (upro) were checked every week. after 5-week intervention, at the end of the study, the rats were sacrificed and blood samples were collected for examination of biochemical parameters, including glomerular morphological makers, podocyte shape, cellular apoptosis, expressions of nephrin, inflammatory and apoptosis markers.resultshqh ameliorated the rat’s general status, proteinuria, renal morphological appearance and glomerulosclerosis. the decreased expression of nephrin in adrn rats was increased by hqh, as well as the impaired podocyte foot process fusion. cytosolic levels of p65 and inhibitor of nuclear factor κbα (iκbα) were decreased in adrn rats, and recovered by the treatment of hqh. consistently, the induced expression of tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α), phosphorylated nuclear factor κb p65 (p-nfκb p65) and iκbα in adrn were markedly suppressed by hqh. in addition, induction of bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cytochrome c in adrn rats were suppressed by hqh, indicating the amelioration of apoptosis.conclusionhqh could ameliorate renal impairments in adrn rats by increasing nephrin expression, inhibiting nf-κb signaling pathway via the down-regulation of p-nf-κb p65 and p-iκbα, and suppression of glomerular and tubular apoptosis. in this study, we investigated the synergistic effects of panobinostat and bortezomib on adriamycin-resistant hl60/adr cells and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) primary cells. combination of both agents had synergistic cytotoxicity on these cells, and increased the sensitivity of hl60/adr cells to adriamycin. panobinostat plus bortezomib was shown to modulate multiple apoptotic and drug metabolic related molecules, including activation of caspases, down-regulation of xiap, bcl-2 and mrp1. these effects were likely to be mediated via inhibition of akt and nf-κb pathways. these findings provide evidence for clinic protocols using panobinostat and borezomib to overcome drug resistance in refractory aml patients.
we investigated the possible association between susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the interleukin-6 gene (−174 g/c) in a sample of the egyptian population and the contribution of this polymorphism in the clinical or immunological manifestation of the disease. forty-two egyptian patients with sle and 40 unrelated healthy control volunteers were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by visualization on 4% agarose gel electrophoresis on ultraviolet transilluminator to detect the genotype distribution and allelic frequencies of the polymorphisms. the homozygous gg genotypes was significantly increased in sle patients compared to control group (p value = 0.04). on the other hand, the heterozygous g/c genotype was significantly elevated in the controls compared to sle patients (p value = 0.01). the odds ratio value for g/g was 2.6 with a 95% ci from 1.1 to 6.7. as regard the association of clinical manifestations to the genotype frequency, we found a statistical significant increase in the frequency of gg genotype with chest disease, nephritis, and arthritis. from this study, we suggest that g carrier is more susceptible to develop sle and that snp may have a role in the pathogenesis of the disease and may be associated with some of its clinical manifestations. autoreactive b cells and plasma cells appear to be of central importance in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) characterized by a plethora of autoantibodies. recent insights into abnormalities of b cell and plasma cell compartments in human sle have identified a number of cellular disturbances within these compartments that in part correlate with the disease activity. this review discusses these findings and the potential underlying extrinsic and/or intrinsic influences apparently driving general b cell activation in this entity.
abstract little is known about the effects of inhalant anaesthetics on the avian electroencephalogram (eeg). the effects of halothane on the avian eeg are of interest, as this agent has been widely used to study nociception and analgesia in mammals. the objective of this study was to characterize the effects of halothane anaesthesia on the eeg of the chicken. twelve female hyline brown chickens aged 8–10 weeks were anaesthetized with halothane in oxygen. for each bird, anaesthesia was progressively increased from 1–1.5 to 2 times the minimum anesthetic concentration (mac), then progressively decreased again. at each concentration, a sample of eeg was recorded after a 10‐min stabilization period. the mean total power (ptot), median frequency (f50) and 95% spectral edge frequency (f95) were calculated at each halothane mac, along with the burst suppression ratio (bsr). burst suppression was rare and bsr did not differ between halothane concentrations. increasing halothane concentration from 1 to 2 mac resulted in a decrease in f50 and increase in ptot, while f95 increased when mac was reduced from 1.5 to 1. the results indicate dose‐dependent spectral eeg changes consistent with deepening anaesthesia in response to increasing halothane mac. as burst suppression was rare, even at 1.5 or 2 times mac, halothane may be a suitable anaesthetic agent for use in future studies exploring eeg activity in anaesthetized birds. methodology for assessment of depth of anaesthesia based on analysis of the electroencephalogram (eeg) is controversial. techniques range from display of single measures, for example median value of the frequency spectrum, to dedicated pattern recognition systems based on measures of several eeg features. we have compared the performance of four techniques using tape-recorded data from 23 patients anaesthetized with either halothane or isoflurane using standardized regimens. the techniques were: (1) median frequency, (2) spectral edge frequency, (3) the cerebral function analysing monitor (cfam1) and (4) a depth of anaesthesia monitor based on eeg pattern recognition (adam). dose-response curves are presented for stepwise increases in stable end-tidal concentrations of each agent. results indicated considerable inter-patient variability and the limitations of single eeg measures, particularly with deeper anaesthesia producing a burst suppression pattern in the eeg. pattern recognition techniques reduced these difficulties and appeared to be promising over a wide range of anaesthetic levels.
backgrounddiagnosis and prognosis in breast cancer are mainly based on histology and immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) material. recently, gene expression analysis was shown to elucidate the biological variance between tumors and molecular markers were identified that led to new classification systems that provided better prognostic and predictive parameters. archived ffpe samples represent an ideal source of tissue for translational research, as millions of tissue blocks exist from routine diagnostics and from clinical studies. these should be exploited to provide clinicians with more accurate prognostic and predictive information. unfortunately, rna derived from ffpe material is partially degraded and chemically modified and reliable gene expression measurement has only become successful after implementing novel and optimized procedures for rna isolation, demodification and detection.methodsin this study we used tissue cylinders as known from the construction of tissue microarrays. rna was isolated with a robust protocol recently developed for rna derived from ffpe material. gene expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription pcr.resultssixteen tissue blocks from 7 patients diagnosed with multiple histological subtypes of breast cancer were available for this study. after verification of appropriate localization, sufficient rna yield and quality, 30 tissue cores were available for gene expression measurement on taqman® low density arrays (16 invasive ductal carcinoma (idc), 8 ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) and 6 normal tissue), and 14 tissue cores were lost. gene expression values were used to calculate scores representing the proliferation status (pro), the estrogen receptor status and the her2 status. the pro scores measured from entire sections were similar to pro scores determined from idc tissue cores. scores determined from normal tissue cores consistently revealed lower pro scores than cores derived from idc or dcis of the same block or from different blocks of the same patient.conclusionwe have developed optimized protocols for rna isolation from histologically distinct areas. rna prepared from ffpe tissue cores is suitable for gene expression measurement by quantitative pcr. distinct molecular scores could be determined from different cores of the same tumor specimen. although distinct pathological stages of breast cancer have been described, the molecular differences among these stages are largely unknown. here, through the combined use of laser capture microdissection and dna microarrays, we have generated in situ gene expression profiles of the premalignant, preinvasive, and invasive stages of human breast cancer. our data reveal extensive similarities at the transcriptome level among the distinct stages of progression and suggest that gene expression alterations conferring the potential for invasive growth are already present in the preinvasive stages. in contrast to tumor stage, different tumor grades are associated with distinct gene expression signatures. furthermore, a subset of genes associated with high tumor grade is quantitatively correlated with the transition from preinvasive to invasive growth.
motor imagery (mi) is defined as mental execution without any actual movement. while healthy adults usually show temporal equivalence, i.e., isochrony, between the mental simulation of an action and its actual performance, neurological disorders are associated with anisochrony. unlike in patients with stroke and parkinson disease, only a few studies have investigated differences of mi ability in multiple sclerosis (ms). however, the relationship among disease severity, anisochrony and brain activation patterns during mi has not been investigated yet. here, we propose to investigate mi in ms patients using fmri during a behavioral task executed with dominant/non-dominant hand and to evaluate whether anisochrony is associated with disease severity. thirty-seven right-handed ms patients, 17 with clinically isolated syndrome (cis) suggestive of ms and 20 with relapsing-remitting ms (rr-ms) and 20 right-handed healthy controls (hc) underwent fmri during a motor task consisting in the actual or imaged movement of squeezing a foam ball with the dominant and non-dominant hand. the same tasks were performed outside the mri room to record the number of actual and imagined ball squeezes, and calculate an index of performance (ip) based on the ratio between actual and imagined movements. ip showed that a progressive loss of ability in simulating actions (i.e., anisochrony) more pronounced for non-dominant hand, was found as function of the disease course. moreover, anisochrony was associated with activation of occipito-parieto-frontal areas that were more extensive at the early stages of the disease, probably in order to counteract the changes due to ms. however, the neural engagement of compensatory brain areas becomes more difficult with more challenging tasks, i.e., dominant vs. non-dominant hand, with a consequent deficit in behavioral performance. these results show a strict association between mi performance and disease severity, suggesting that, at early stages of the disease, anisochrony in mi could be considered as surrogate behavioral marker of ms severity. background movement-associated cortical reorganisation is known to occur in multiple sclerosis (ms). we aimed to define the development of such cortical reorganisation by comparing data from patients with different disease phenotypes.   methods we studied patients with different phenotypes of ms: 16 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (cis), 14 patients with relapsing-remitting ms (rrms) and no disability, 15 patients with rrms and mild clinical disability, and 12 patients with secondary progressive ms (spms). patients did a simple motor task with their unimpaired dominant hand during mri, which was compared across the phenotype groups.   findings patients with a cis activated more of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex than those with rrms and no disability, whereas patients with rrms and no disability activated more of the supplementary motor area than those with a cis. patients with rrms and no disability activated more of the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally, and more of the ipsilateral supplementary motor area than patients with rrms and mild clinical disability. conversely, patients with rrms and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, and the ipsilateral precuneus. patients with rrms and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral thalamus and of the ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex than those with spms. however, patients with spms activated more of the inferior frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the middle frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the contralateral precuneus, and the ipsilateral cingulate motor area and inferior parietal lobule.   interpretation movement-associated cortical reorganisation in patients with ms seems to vary across individuals at different stages of disease. our study suggests that early in the disease course more areas typically devoted to motor tasks are recruited. then bilateral activation of these regions is seen, and late in the disease course, areas that healthy people recruit to do novel or complex tasks are activated.
transient focal cerebral ischemia leads to extensive excitotoxic glial damage in the subcortical white matter. efficient reuptake of released glutamate is essential for preventing glutamate receptor overstimulation and neuronal and glial death. the present study evaluates the expression of the main glutamate transporters (eaat1, eaat2, and eaat3) in subcortical white matter of the rat after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry show an increase in the expression of eaat1 and eaat2 in subcortical white matter early after ischemia which subsequently decreases at longer reperfusion periods. however, expression of both eaat1 and eaat2 remains higher in astrocytes forming the gliotic scar and in microglial/macrophage cells at the border of or within the infarct area, respectively. taken together, these results indicate that there is a transient enhanced expression of eaats in the subcortical white matter early after ischemia. our findings reveal an adaptive response of subcortical white matter to increased levels of glutamate during focal cerebral ischemia which may limit excitotoxic damage. since it has been suggested that microglia in vivo act as glutamate scavengers, this possibility was investigated in primary cultured microglia. the microglia showed specific abilities to uptake (14)c-glutamate depending on incubation time and numbers of cells used. the activity was suppressed by a specific inhibitor for a glial cell-type transporter, glutamate transporter-1 (glt-1) (eaat2). however, that of cultured astrocytes was not affected. these results suggest that microglia uptake glutamate by means of glt-1. supporting these results, immunoblotting revealed the presence of glt-1 in the microglia, while only glutamate-aspartate transporter (glast) (eaat1: another glial cell-type transporter) was detected in the astrocytes. all together, these results indicate that microglia can act as glutamate scavengers in vivo by expressing the glutamate transporter glt-1.
aim: to examine and compare the prevalence of morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae in children with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate and in children without a cleft. subjects and method: the cleft group consisted of 325 children (150 girls and 175 boys) born with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (mean age 11.1 years). the control group consisted of 325 children without a cleft, matched on age and gender. lateral cephalograms exposing upper cervical vertebrae (c1 c3) were examined regarding morphological anomalies such as posterior arch deficiencies, fusion anomalies, odontoid anomalies and vertebral artery canal. results: the prevalence of morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae was 24.3 per cent (n=79) in children with cleft and 12.6 per cent (n=41) in children without a cleft. the occurrence of cervical vertebral anomalies in children with clefts were two times more often in comparison with the children without a cleft (p<0.001). posterior arch deficiency and vertebral fusion were found to occur significantly more often in children with cleft (p<0.001). no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding odontoid anomalies and vertebral artery canal. conclusion: morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae occurred in children with clefts significantly more often in comparison with the children without a cleft. objective: to investigate anatomical variations and abnormalities of cervical spine morphology in unoperated infants with cleft lip and palate. design: retrospective cross-sectional investigation of infants born with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate using computed tomography scans acquired for investigation of a spectrum of clinical conditions. setting: computed tomography scan data were obtained from 29 unoperated cleft lip and palate infants and 12 noncleft infants of malay origin, ages 0 to 12 months. methods: observational study of cervical spine computed tomography scans. heights of cervical vertebral bodies (c2-c7) and intervertebral spaces were measured from landmarks identified from computed tomography reformats and three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions. linear modeling of heights and spaces, with age as a covariate, was undertaken to identify differences between the samples. results: anomalous features observed in the cleft lip and palate sample included short posterior arch of c1 (2/29), abnormal development of the anterior arch of c1 (2/29), and fusions of the posterior arch of c2 and c3 (2/29). no anomalies of the cervical spine were observed in the noncleft sample. although the heights of three cervical vertebral bodies were significantly smaller and two intervertebral spaces were significantly larger in infants with cleft lip and palate compared with noncleft infants (p < .05), overall length of the cervical spine did not differ significantly between the samples. conclusion: there was evidence for subtle upper spinal anomalies in the infant cleft lip and palate population. our finding of reduced size of some cervical vertebral bodies may reflect delayed upper spinal development in infants with cleft lip and palate.
n‐acylethanolamines (naes) are endogenous lipid ligands for several receptors including cannabinoid receptors and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐alpha (ppar‐α), which regulate numerous physiological functions. fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah) is largely responsible for the degradation of naes. however, at high concentrations of ethanolamines and unesterified fatty acids, faah can also catalyze the reverse reaction, producing naes. several brain insults such as ischemia and hypoxia increase brain unesterified fatty acids. because faah can catalyze the synthesis of nae, we aimed to test whether faah was necessary for co2 ‐induced hypercapnia/ischemia increases in nae. to test this, we examined levels of naes, 1‐ and 2‐arachidonoylglycerols as well as their corresponding fatty acid precursors in wild‐type and mice lacking faah (faah‐ko) with three kill methods: (i) head‐focused, high‐energy microwave irradiation (microwave), (ii) 5 min co2 followed by microwave irradiation (co2 + microwave), and (iii) 5 min co2 only (co2). both co2‐induced groups increased, to a similar extent, brain levels of unesterified oleic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acid and 1‐ and 2‐arachidonoylglycerols compared to the microwave group in both wild‐type and faah‐ko mice. oleoylethanolamide (oea), arachidonoylethanolamide (aea), and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (dhea) levels were about 8‐, 7‐, and 2.5‐fold higher, respectively, in the faah‐ko mice compared with the wild‐type mice. interestingly, the concentrations of oea, aea, and dhea increased 2.5‐ to 4‐fold in response to both co2‐induced groups in wild‐type mice, but dhea increased only in the co2 group in faah‐ko mice. our study demonstrates that faah is necessary for co2‐ induced increases in oea and aea but not dhea. targeting brain faah could impair the production of naes in response to brain injuries. the field of lipidomics has evolved vastly since its creation 15 years ago. advancements in mass spectrometry have allowed for the identification of hundreds of intact lipids and lipid mediators. however, because of the release of fatty acids from the phospholipid membrane in the brain caused by ischemia, identifying the neurolipidome has been challenging. microwave fixation has been shown to reduce the ischemia‐induced release of several lipid mediators. therefore, this study aimed to develop a method combining high‐resolution tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms), high‐energy head‐focused microwave fixation and statistical modeling, allowing for the measurement of intact lipids and lipid mediators in order to eliminate the ischemia‐induced release of fatty acids and identify the rat neurolipidome. in this study, we demonstrated the ischemia‐induced production of bioactive lipid mediators, and the reduction in variability using microwave fixation in combination with liquid chromatography (lc)–ms/ms. we have also illustrated for the first time that microwave fixation eliminates the alterations in intact lipid species following ischemia. while many phospholipid species were unchanged by ischemia, other intact lipid classes, such as diacylglycerol, were lower in concentration following microwave fixation compared to ischemia.
from birth onwards, the human gut microbiota rapidly increases in diversity and reaches an adult-like stage at three years of age. after this age, the composition may fluctuate in response to external factors such as antibiotics. previous studies have shown that resilience is not complete months after cessation of the antibiotic intake. however, little is known about the short-term effects of antibiotic intake on the gut microbial community. here we examined the load and composition of the fecal microbiota immediately after treatment in 21 patients, who received broad-spectrum antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and β-lactams. a fecal sample was collected from all participants before treatment and one week after for microbial load and community composition analyses by quantitative pcr and pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene, respectively. fluoroquinolones and β-lactams significantly decreased microbial diversity by 25% and reduced the core phylogenetic microbiota from 29 to 12 taxa. however, at the phylum level, these antibiotics increased the bacteroidetes/firmicutes ratio (p = 0.0007, fdr = 0.002). at the species level, our findings unexpectedly revealed that both antibiotic types increased the proportion of several unknown taxa belonging to the bacteroides genus, a gram-negative group of bacteria (p = 0.0003, fdr<0.016). furthermore, the average microbial load was affected by the treatment. indeed, the β-lactams increased it significantly by two-fold (p = 0.04). the maintenance of or possible increase detected in microbial load and the selection of gram-negative over gram-positive bacteria breaks the idea generally held about the effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on gut microbiota. mucosal tolerance has been considered a potentially important pathway for the treatment of autoimmune disease, including human multiple sclerosis and experimental conditions such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae). there is limited information on the capacity of commensal gut bacteria to induce and maintain peripheral immune tolerance. inbred sjl and c57bl/6 mice were treated orally with a broad spectrum of antibiotics to reduce gut microflora. reduction of gut commensal bacteria impaired the development of eae. intraperitoneal antibiotic-treated mice showed no significant decline in the gut microflora and developed eae similar to untreated mice, suggesting that reduction in disease activity was related to alterations in the gut bacterial population. protection was associated with a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and increases in il-10 and il-13. adoptive transfer of low numbers of il-10-producing cd25+cd4+ t cells (>75% foxp3+) purified from cervical lymph nodes of commensal bacteria reduced mice and in vivo neutralization of cd25+ cells suggested the role of regulatory t cells maintaining peripheral immune homeostasis. our data demonstrate that antibiotic modification of gut commensal bacteria can modulate peripheral immune tolerance that can protect against eae. this approach may offer a new therapeutic paradigm in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and perhaps other autoimmune conditions.
systems code is almost universally written in the c programming language or a variant. c has a very low level of type and memory abstraction and formal reasoning about c systems code requires a memory model that is able to capture the semantics of c pointers and types. at the same time, proof-based verification demands abstraction, in particular from the aliasing and frame problems. in this paper we present a study in the mechanisation of two proof abstractions for pointer program verification in the isabelle/hol theorem prover, based on a low-level memory model for c. the language’s type system presents challenges for the multiple independent typed heaps (burstall-bornat) and separation logic proof techniques. in addition to issues arising from explicit value size/alignment, padding, type-unsafe casts and pointer address arithmetic, structured types such as c’s arrays and structs are problematic due to the non-monotonic nature of pointer and lvalue validity in the presence of the unary &-operator. for example, type-safe updates through pointers to fields of a struct break the independence of updates across typed heaps or ∧∗-conjuncts. we provide models and rules that are able to cope with these language features and types, eschewing common over-simplifications and utilising expressive shallow embeddings in higher-order logic. two case studies are provided that demonstrate the applicability of the mechanised models to real-world systems code; a working of the standard in-place list reversal example and an overview of the verification of the l4 microkernel’s memory allocator. we present a formal model of memory that both captures the low-level features of c's pointers and memory, and that forms the basis for an expressive implementation of separation logic. at the low level, we do not commit common oversimplifications, but correctly deal with c's model of programming language values and the heap. at the level of separation logic, we are still able to reason abstractly and efficiently. we implement this framework in the theorem prover isabelle/hol and demonstrate it on two case studies. we show that the divide between detailed and abstract does not impose undue verification overhead, and that simple programs remain easy to verify. we also show that the framework is applicable to real, security- and safety-critical code by formally verifying the memory allocator of the l4 microkernel.
it is well established that certain stress proteins or molecular chaperones are highly efficient in cross-presenting tumor-derived antigens, resulting in a potent antitumor immune response. in this study we demonstrate that genetic modification of weakly immunogenic murine prostate tumor cells (tramp-c2) by stable transfection with a secretable form of endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone grp170 significantly enhances its immunogenicity in vivo. generation of systemic antitumor immunity is indicated by the growth suppression of distant parental tumors, which is associated with increased tumor infiltration, elevated effector functions of cd8+ t-cells. immunization with inactivated grp170-secreting c2 cells augments a cd8+ t-cell dependent, tumor-protective effect. furthermore, infection of c2 tumor cells with a nonreplicating adenoviral vectors encoding secretable grp170 promotes tumor immunogenicity more effectively than plasmid transduction, as shown by the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α by dendritice cells and enhanced therapeutic efficacy in treating pre-established tumors. given a repertoire of undefined antigens in prostate tumor, manipulation of cellular compartmentalization of immuno-stimulatory chaperone grp170 to elicit systemic tumor immunity may be used to improve treatment outcomes for prostate cancer when combined with other treatment modalities. abstract. several studies have suggested a positive correlation between heat shock protein (hsp) expression and tumor immunogenicity. independently, many studies have shown that hsp purified from tumors can be used as a tumor-specific vaccine. in this study, we have explored the connection between hsp expression and anti-tumor immunity by transducing murine ct26 colon carcinoma cells with the cdna of a major hsp, i.e. hsp110. we have shown that over-expression of hsp110 has no effect on ct26 tumor cell growth in vitro, and does not inhibit their anchorage-independent growth capacity. however, in situ, hsp110 over-expressing ct26 tumor (ct26-hsp110) grew at a significantly reduced rate as compared to the wild-type ct26 tumor in immunocompetent mice. moreover, immunization of mice with inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells significantly inhibited the growth of wild-type ct26 tumor. this immunity was associated with an increased frequency of tumor-specific t cells after vaccination. an in vivo antibody depletion assay demonstrated that inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells elicited anti-tumor responses involving cd8+ t cells and natural killer (nk) cells, but not cd4+ t cells. lastly, the effect of the addition of granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm–csf) to these vaccine formulations was determined. mice immunized with irradiated ct26-hsp110 cells combined with gm–csf-producing bystander cells revealed a complete inhibition of ct26 tumor growth, indicating a synergy between inactivated ct26-hsp110 vaccine activity and gm–csf. these observations demonstrate that manipulation of hsp110 expression in tumors, specifically when combined with gm–csf, represents a potentially powerful approach to cancer vaccine formulation.
cardiac hypertrophy is a complex and nonhomogenous response to various stimuli. in this study, we used high-density oligonucleotide microarray to examine gene expression profiles during physiological hypertrophy, pathological hypertrophy, and heart failure in dahl salt-sensitive rats. there were changes in 404/3,160 and 874/3,160 genes between physiological and pathological hypertrophy and the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure, respectively. there were increases in stress response genes (e.g., heat shock proteins) and inflammation-related genes (e.g., pancreatitis-associated protein and arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase) in pathological processes but not in physiological hypertrophy. furthermore, atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic protein showed distinctive changes that are very specific to different conditions. in addition, we used a resampling-based gene score-calculating method to define significantly altered gene clusters, based on gene ontology classification. it revealed significant alterations in genes involved in the apoptosis pathway during pathological hypertrophy, suggesting that the apoptosis pathway may play a role during the transition to heart failure. in addition, there were significant changes in glucose/insulin signaling, protein biosynthesis, and epidermal growth factor signaling during physiological hypertrophy but not during pathological hypertrophy. objectives brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) is a strong predictor of left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy (lvh) and dysfunction. however, our recent studies suggested that lvh is not necessarily associated with enhanced production of bnp in hypertension. this study aimed to clarify the relation of the characteristics of hypertrophy with the degree of gene expression of bnp in the developmental process of hypertensive heart failure. methods serial changes in lv geometry, histology and atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) and bnp mrna levels, were assessed in a hypertensive heart failure model using dahl salt-sensitive rats (n = 24). we further studied effects of α1-receptor antagonist (doxazosin: 1 mg/kg per day, n = 5) and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor (at1r) antagonist (candesartan cilexetil: 1 mg/kg per day, n = 5). results the bnp mrna level was not elevated at the compensatory hypertrophic stage when anp mrna level was elevated. bnp mrna level was increased with further progression of hypertrophy and development of fibrosis. at1r blockade prevented such fibrosis and further progression of hypertrophy with normalization of bnp mrna levels. compensatory hypertrophy was not suppressed; therefore, anp mrna level, although decreased, was still beyond the normal level. the α1-receptor blockade slightly attenuated lv hypertrophy with a slight decrease in anp mrna levels. lv fibrosis was not prevented, and the bnp mrna level was not decreased. conclusions bnp gene expression is not enhanced by initial compensatory hypertrophy, but is enhanced by lv fibrosis and late stage progression of hypertrophy dependent on at1r-mediated signaling pathway.
this article reports the results of a small-scale quasi-experiment that tested the efficacy of the prevention options for positives intervention. the experiment tested for the outcomes of group sessions combined with individual-level counseling (ilc) versus ilc-only for men who have sex with men who are hiv positive. both arms of the intervention were based on behavior change theory and dealt specifically with communication outcomes. the results indicate that the group- and individual-level interventions combined have a greater impact on risk communication behaviors with main partners than did the ilc-only sessions. group-session/ilc participants were more likely to decide not to have sex if they were drunk or high, and more likely to tell their partner and ask their partner about hiv status than were participants in the ilc groups. knowledge about hiv was relatively high, and there was little change across groups. the prevention options for positives intervention influenced the relative importance of various referent groups, but normative beliefs were not affected. the implications of these findings for communication practice and research with hiv-positive men who have sex with men are addressed. context the efficacy of counseling to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and other sexually transmitted diseases (stds) has not been definitively shown.   objective to compare the effects of 2 interactive hiv/std counseling interventions with didactic prevention messages typical of current practice.   design multicenter randomized controlled trial (project respect), with participants assigned to 1 of 3 individual face-to-face interventions.   setting five public std clinics (baltimore, md; denver, colo; long beach, calif; newark, nj; and san francisco, calif) between july 1993 and september 1996.   participants a total of 5758 heterosexual, hiv-negative patients aged 14 years or older who came for std examinations.   interventions arm 1 received enhanced counseling, 4 interactive theory-based sessions. arm 2 received brief counseling, 2 interactive risk-reduction sessions. arms 3 and 4 each received 2 brief didactic messages typical of current care. arms 1, 2, and 3 were actively followed up after enrollment with questionnaires at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and std tests at 6 and 12 months. an intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare interventions.   main outcome measures self-reported condom use and new diagnoses of stds (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, hiv) defined by laboratory tests.   results at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, self-reported 100% condom use was higher (p<.05) in both the enhanced counseling and brief counseling arms compared with participants in the didactic messages arm. through the 6-month interval, 30% fewer participants had new stds in both the enhanced counseling (7.2%; p= .002) and brief counseling (7.3%; p= .005) arms compared with those in the didactic messages arm (10.4%). through the 12-month study, 20% fewer participants in each counseling intervention had new stds compared with those in the didactic messages arm (p = .008). consistently at each of the 5 study sites, std incidence was lower in the counseling intervention arms than in the didactic messages intervention arm. reduction of std was similar for men and women and greater for adolescents and persons with an std diagnosed at enrollment.   conclusions short counseling interventions using personalized risk reduction plans can increase condom use and prevent new stds. effective counseling can be conducted even in busy public clinics.
study objective hypotension frequently occurs during spinal anesthesia (sa), especially in the elderly. phenylephrine is effective to prevent sa-induced hypotension during cesarean delivery. the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine after sa for orthopedic surgery in the elderly.   design this prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study included 54 patients older than 60 years undergoing elective lower limb surgery under sa (injection of 10 mg of isobaric bupivacaine with 5 μg of sufentanyl).   intervention patients were randomized to group p (100-μg/ml solution of phenylephrine solution at 1 ml/min after placement of sa) or the control group c (0.9% isotonic sodium chloride solution). the flow of the infusion was stopped if the mean arterial blood pressure (map) was higher than the baseline map and maintained or restarted at 1 ml/min if map was equal to or lower than the baseline map. heart rate and map were collected throughout the case.   measurements hypotension was defined by a 20% decrease and hypertension as a 20% increase from baseline map. bradycardia was defined as a heart rate lower than 50 beats per minute.   main results twenty-eight patients were randomized to group p and 26 patients to group c. map was higher in group p than in group c (92 ± 2 vs 82 ± 2 mm hg, mean ± sd, p< .001). the number of hypotensive episodes per patient was higher in group c compared with group p (9 [0-39] vs 1 [0-10], median [extremes], p< .01), but the number of hypotensive patients was similar between groups (19 [73%] vs 20 [71%], p= 1). the time to onset of the first hypotension was shorter in group c (3 [1-13] vs 15 [1-95] minutes, p= .004). the proportion of patients without hypotension (cumulative survival) was better in group p (p= .04). the number of hypertensive episodes per patient and the number of bradycardic episodes per patient were similar between groups (p= not significant).   conclusion prophylactic phenylephrine infusion is an effective method of reducing sa-induced hypotension in the elderly. compared with a control group, it delays the time to onset of hypotension and decreases the number of hypotensive episodes per patient. more data are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes of such a strategy. unlabelled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we evaluated the effect of prophylactic im phenylephrine at doses of 1.5 and 3 mg on hyperbaric tetracaine spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in 90 normotensive and hypertensive patients aged >65 yr undergoing surgery for hip fracture. thirty normotensive patients received 1.5 or 3 mg of phenylephrine im (n/p-1.5 and n/p-3.0 groups; n = 15 in each), whereas controls received saline (n/c group; n = 15), and 45 hypertensive patients were treated in a similar manner (h/p-1.5, h/p-3.0, and h/c groups; n = 15 in each). all groups had a peak sensory block height of t9, with a range of t8 to t10. the incidence of hypotension (>25% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure [map] from baseline) was significantly lower in the patients who received phenylephrine 1.5 or 3 mg than in the controls, both in the normotensive and hypertensive groups (p < 0.01). the n/p-3.0 and n/p-1.5 groups and the h/p-3.0 group had significantly lower percentage reductions in map (p < 0.05) and required significantly smaller doses of rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05) than did the n/c group or the h/c group. the h/p-1.5 group also required significantly less rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05), although it was not sufficient to significantly attenuate the percentage decrease in map compared with that in the h/c group. bradycardia (heart rate <50 bpm) as an adverse effect after im administration of phenylephrine was not observed in any of the groups. hypertension (map >20% increase from baseline) after medication occurred in the n/p-3.0 and h/p-3.0 groups, but not in the n/p-1.5 and h/p-1.5 groups. we conclude that prophylactic im injection of 1.5 mg of phenylephrine is a safe (defined as the inhibition of bradycardia and hypertension) and effective means of reducing the incidence of hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients.   implications we evaluated the efficacy and safety of small-dose im phenylephrine for prophylaxis against spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients. phenylephrine 1.5 mg im was effective for reducing the incidence of hypotension and avoided adverse effects.
we investigated the possible association between susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the interleukin-6 gene (−174 g/c) in a sample of the egyptian population and the contribution of this polymorphism in the clinical or immunological manifestation of the disease. forty-two egyptian patients with sle and 40 unrelated healthy control volunteers were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by visualization on 4% agarose gel electrophoresis on ultraviolet transilluminator to detect the genotype distribution and allelic frequencies of the polymorphisms. the homozygous gg genotypes was significantly increased in sle patients compared to control group (p value = 0.04). on the other hand, the heterozygous g/c genotype was significantly elevated in the controls compared to sle patients (p value = 0.01). the odds ratio value for g/g was 2.6 with a 95% ci from 1.1 to 6.7. as regard the association of clinical manifestations to the genotype frequency, we found a statistical significant increase in the frequency of gg genotype with chest disease, nephritis, and arthritis. from this study, we suggest that g carrier is more susceptible to develop sle and that snp may have a role in the pathogenesis of the disease and may be associated with some of its clinical manifestations. autoreactive b cells and plasma cells appear to be of central importance in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) characterized by a plethora of autoantibodies. recent insights into abnormalities of b cell and plasma cell compartments in human sle have identified a number of cellular disturbances within these compartments that in part correlate with the disease activity. this review discusses these findings and the potential underlying extrinsic and/or intrinsic influences apparently driving general b cell activation in this entity.
the aim of this study was to determine whether intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (iai) was associated with subsequent ruptured membranes in women with preterm labor and intact membranes who had a clinically indicated amniocentesis. this retrospective cohort study included 237 consecutive women with preterm labor (20-34.6 weeks) who underwent amniocentesis. the clinical and laboratory parameters evaluated included demographic variables, gestational age, c-reactive protein (crp) and amniotic fluid (af) white blood cell, interleukin-6 (il-6) and culture results. iai was defined as a positive af culture and/or an elevated af il-6 level (>2.6 ng/ml). the primary outcome was ruptured membranes in the absence of active labor occurring within 48 hours of amniocentesis. preterm premature rupture of membranes subsequently developed in 10 (4.2%) women within 48 hr of amniocentesis. multivariate analysis demonstrated that only iai was independently associated with the ruptured membranes occurring within 48 hr of amniocentesis. in the predictive model based on variables assessed before amniocentesis, only crp level was retained. iai is an independent risk factor for subsequent ruptured membranes after clinically indicated amniocentesis in preterm labor. prior to amniocentesis, measurement of serum crp level can provide a risk assessment for the subsequent development of ruptured membranes after the procedure. objective our purpose was to determine risk factors predictive of preterm premature rupture of the membranes in women treated for preterm labor with intact membranes.   study design women with intact membranes participating in a national institute of child health and human development multicenter randomized trial of adjunctive antibiotic therapy for preterm labor (24 to 34 weeks) were studied (n = 275). after randomization, 22 women continued to have contractions and were delivered of their infants. the remaining 253 women whose contractions had ceased composed our study population. preterm premature rupture of the membranes was diagnosed if ruptured membranes occurred > or = 1 hour before the onset of recurrent preterm labor. as part of the study protocol, most women underwent amniocentesis on admission.   results preterm premature rupture of the membranes developed in 44% women (17.4%). women who had preterm premature rupture of the membranes were more likely to be black (p = 0.004), to be multiparous (p = 0.014), to have a history of abortion(s) (p = 0.001), to have had a preterm birth(s) (p = 0.036), to have early onset preterm labor (p = 0.04), to have more advanced cervical dilatation (p = 0.0001), to have one or more amniotic fluid markers suggestive of infection (p = 0.01, odds ratio 4.2), and to have positive amniotic fluid cultures (p = 0.0007, odds ratio 27). assignment to antibiotic therapy did not prevent preterm premature rupture of the membranes in the 253 women randomized or in the 16 women with a positive amniotic fluid marker(s) of infection.   conclusion black race, multiparity, a history of abortion or preterm birth, advanced dilatation, and a positive amniotic fluid marker(s) are associated with preterm premature rupture of the membranes in women with preterm labor. antibiotic treatment did not prevent preterm premature rupture of the membranes.
perturbations in neurogenesis in the adult brain have been implicated in impaired learning and memory. in the present study, we investigated which stages of the neurogenic process are affected in the transgenic yac128 mouse model of huntington disease (hd). hippocampal neuronal proliferation was altered in the dentate gyrus (dg) of yac128 mice as compared with wild-type (wt) littermate controls in early symptomatic to end-stage mice. in addition, we detected a significantly lower number of immature neurons in the dg of young, pre-symptomatic yac128 mice. this decrease in neuronal differentiation persisted through the progression of the disease, and resulted in an overall reduction in the number of new mature neurons in the dg of yac128 mice. there were no changes in cell proliferation and differentiation in the subventricular zone (svz). in this study, we demonstrate decreases in neurogenesis in the dg of yac128 mice, and these deficits may contribute to the cognitive abnormalities observed in these animals. the lifelong addition of neurons to the hippocampus is a remarkable form of structural plasticity, yet the molecular controls over proliferation, neuronal fate determination, survival, and maturation are poorly understood. expression of notch1 was found to change dynamically depending on the differentiation state of neural precursor cells. through the use of inducible gain- and loss-of-function of notch1 mice we show that this membrane receptor is essential to these distinct processes. we found in vivo that activated notch1 overexpression induces proliferation, whereas γ-secretase inhibition or genetic ablation of notch1 promotes cell cycle exit, indicating that the level of activated notch1 regulates the magnitude of neurogenesis from postnatal progenitor cells. abrogation of notch signaling in vivo or in vitro leads to a transition from neural stem or precursor cells to transit-amplifying cells or neurons. further, genetic notch1 manipulation modulates survival and dendritic morphology of newborn granule cells. these results provide evidence for the expansive prevalence of notch signaling in hippocampal morphogenesis and plasticity, suggesting that notch1 could be a target of diverse traumatic and environmental modulators of adult neurogenesis.
mycorrhizal symbiosis is common among land plants including pteridophytes (monilophytes and lycophytes). in pteridophytes with diplohaplontic life cycle, mycorrhizal formations were mostly reported for sporophytes, but very few for gametophytes. to clarify the mycorrhizal association of photosynthetic gametophytes, field-collected gametophytes of angiopterislygodiifolia (marattiaceae, n = 52) and osmundajaponica (osmundaceae, n = 45) were examined using microscopic and molecular techniques. collected gametophytes were mostly cut into two pieces. one piece was used for light and scanning microscopic observations, and the other for molecular identification of plant species (chloroplast rbcl sequences) and mycorrhizal fungi (small subunit rdna sequences). microscopic observations showed that 96 % (50/52) of angiopteris and 95 % (41/43) of osmunda gametophytes contained intracellular hyphae with arbuscules and/or vesicles and fungal colonization was limited to the inner tissue of the thick midribs (cushion). fungal dna analyses showed that 92 % (48/52) of angiopteris and 92 % (35/38) of osmunda have sequences of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which were highly divergent but all belonged to glomus group a. these results suggest that a.lygodiifolia and o.japonica gametophytes consistently form arbuscular mycorrhizae. mycorrhizal formation in wild fern gametophytes, based on large-scale sampling with molecular identification of host plant species, was demonstrated for the first time. many plant species are characterized by a life cycle with a long-lived, subterranean phase that is completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungal symbionts for fixed carbon. this type of life cycle is both phylogenetically and ecologically widespread and is found in diverse vascular plant lineages from the tropics to subalpine meadows. here we report on the molecular identities of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the autotrophic and underground mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of the ferns botrychium crenulatum and b. lanceolatum. we show that the glomus taxa found in the mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum are also found in conspecific and heterospecific photosynthetic neighboring plants. from our dna sequence data, we infer carbon flow from photosynthetic plants to mycoheterotrophic plants through shared glomalean fungal networks. finally, our phylogenetic analyses identify a major glomus clade that forms associations with mycoheterotrophic life cycle stages of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum.
the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bstl) is involved in mediating anxiety‐related behaviors to sustained aversive stimuli. the bstl forms part of the central extended amygdala, a continuum composed of the bstl, the amygdala central nucleus, and cell columns running between the two. the central subdivision (bstlcn) and the juxtacapsular subdivision (bstlj) are two bstl regions that lie above the anterior commissure, near the ventral striatum. the amygdala, a heterogeneous structure that encodes emotional salience, projects to both the bstl and ventral striatum. we placed small injections of retrograde tracers into the bstl, focusing on the bstlcn and bstlj, and analyzed the distribution of labeled cells in amygdala subregions. we compared this to the pattern of labeled cells following injections into the ventral striatum. all retrograde results were confirmed by anterograde studies. we found that the bstlcn receives stronger amygdala inputs relative to the bstlj. furthermore, the bstlcn is defined by inputs from the corticoamygdaloid transition area and central nucleus, while the bstlj receives inputs mainly from the magnocellular accessory basal and basal nucleus. in the ventral striatum, the dorsomedial shell receives inputs that are similar, but not identical, to inputs to the bstlcn. in contrast, amygdala projections to the ventral shell/core are similar to projections to the bstlj. these findings indicate that the bstlcn and bstlj receive distinct amygdala afferent inputs and that the dorsomedial shell is a transition zone with the bstlcn, while the ventral shell/core are transition zones with the bstlj. j. comp. j. comp. neurol. 521:3191–3216, 2013. © 2013 wiley periodicals, inc. the ventral striatum is the part of the striatum associated with reward and goal-directed behaviors, which are mediated in part by inputs from the amygdala. the ventral striatum is divided into 'shell' and 'core' subterritories which have different connectional, histochemical and pharmacological properties. behavioral studies also indicate that subterritories of the ventral striatum are differentially involved in specific goal-directed behaviors. the amygdala is a heterogeneous structure which has multiple nuclei involved in processing emotional information. while the existence of an amygdalostriatal pathway has long been established, the relationship between amygdaloid afferents and specific subterritories of the ventral striatum is not known. in this study we operationally defined the ventromedial striatum as the region receiving cortical inputs primarily from the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex. we placed retrograde tracer injections into subregions of the ventromedial striatum of macaques monkeys to determine the relative contribution of specific amygdaloid inputs to each region. calbindin-d28k immunostaining was used to further define the shell subterritory of the ventromedial striatum. based on these definitions, the amygdala innervates the entire ventromedial striatum, and has few to no inputs to the central striatum. the basal and accessory basal nuclei are the major source of input to the ventromedial striatum, innervating both the shell and ventromedial striatum outside the shell. however, a restricted portion of the dorsomedial shell receives few basal nucleus inputs. afferent inputs from the basal nucleus subdivisions are arranged such that the parvicellular subdivision projects mainly to the ventral shell and core, and the magnocellular subdivision targets the ventral shell and ventromedial putamen. in contrast, the intermediate subdivision of the basal nucleus projects broadly across the ventromedial striatum avoiding only the dorsomedial shell. the shell has a specific set of connections derived from the medial part of the central nucleus and periamygdaloid cortex. within the shell, the dorsomedial region is distinguished by additional inputs from the medial nucleus. the ventromedial caudate nucleus forms a unique transition zone with the shell, based on inputs from the periamygdaloid cortex. together, these results indicate that subterritories of the ventromedial striatum are differentially modulated by amygdaloid nuclei which play roles in processing olfactory, visual/gustatory, multimodal sensory, and 'drive'-related stimuli.
background: accurate data on dietary habits are crucial for understanding impacts on disease and informing policy priorities. nation-specific food balance sheets from the united nations fao provided the only available global dietary estimates but with uncertain validity. objectives: we investigated how fao estimates compared with nationally representative, individual-based dietary surveys from the global dietary database (gdd) and developed calibration equations to improve the validity of fao data to estimate dietary intakes. design: fao estimates were matched to gdd data for 113 countries across the following 9 major dietary metrics for 30 y of data (1980–2009): fruit, vegetables, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, whole grains, red and processed meats, fish and seafood, milk, and total energy. both absolute and percentage differences in fao and gdd mean estimates were evaluated. linear regression was used to evaluate whether fao estimates predicted gdd dietary intakes and whether this prediction varied according to age, sex, region, and time. calibration equations were developed to adjust fao estimates to approximate national dietary surveys validated by using randomly split data sets. results: for most food groups, fao estimates substantially overestimated individual-based dietary intakes by 74.5% (vegetables) and 270% (whole grains) while underestimating beans and legumes (−50%) and nuts and seeds (−29%) (p < 0.05 for each). in multivariate regressions, these overestimations and underestimations for each dietary factor further varied by age, sex, region, and time (p < 0.001 for each). split–data set calibration models, which accounted for country-level covariates and other sources of heterogeneity, effectively adjusted fao estimates to approximate estimates from national survey data (r = 0.47–0.80) with small ses of prediction (generally 1–5 g/d). conclusions: for all food groups and total energy, fao estimates substantially exceeded or underestimated individual-based national surveys of individual intakes with significant variation depending on age, sex, region, and time. calibration models effectively adjusted the comprehensive, widely accessible fao data to facilitate a more-accurate estimation of individual-level dietary intakes nationally and by age and sex. study objective: this project determined to what extent data on diet and nutrition, which were collected in a non-uniform manner, could be harmonised and pooled for international and national comparison. design: direct comparisons of dietary data between studies were made using food balance sheets (fbs), household budget surveys (hbs), and individual dietary data (ids); comparisons were also made within countries. differences in study design and methodological approaches were taken into consideration. data from research projects from the following four world health organisation (who) countrywide integrated noncommunicable disease intervention (cindi) countries were included—canada, finland, poland, and spain. main results: fbs overestimated food consumption and nutrient intake compared to ids. results between hbs and ids were quite similar, except for fish, meat, pulses and vegetables, which were underestimated by hbs, and sugar and honey and cereals, which were overestimated. percentages of energy from fat, carbohydrates and proteins were higher when estimated from fbs, hbs, and ids respectively. conclusions: results suggest that estimations from these three sources of dietary data are difficult to compare because they are measuring different levels of dietary information. the understanding of their relations may be important in formulating and evaluating a nutrition policy.
background: lmtm is being developed as a treatment for ad based on inhibition of tau aggregation. objectives: to examine the efficacy of lmtm as monotherapy in non-randomized cohort analyses as modified primary outcomes in an 18-month phase iii trial in mild ad. methods: mild ad patients (n = 800) were randomly assigned to 100 mg twice a day or 4 mg twice a day. prior to unblinding, the statistical analysis plan was revised to compare the 100 mg twice a day as monotherapy subgroup (n = 79) versus 4 mg twice a day as randomized (n = 396), and 4 mg twice a day as monotherapy (n = 76) versus 4 mg twice a day as add-on therapy (n = 297), with strong control of family-wise type i error. results: the revised analyses were statistically significant at the required threshold of p < 0.025 in both comparisons for change in adas-cog, adcs-adl, mri atrophy, and glucose uptake. the brain atrophy rate was initially typical of mild ad in both add-on and monotherapy groups, but after 9 months of treatment, the rate in monotherapy patients declined significantly to that reported for normal elderly controls. differences in severity or diagnosis at baseline between monotherapy and add-on patients did not account for significant differences in favor of monotherapy. conclusions: the results are consistent with earlier studies in supporting the hypothesis that lmtm might be effective as monotherapy and that 4 mg twice a day may serve as well as higher doses. a further suitably randomized trial is required to test this hypothesis. background as tau aggregation pathology correlates with clinical dementia in alzheimer's disease (ad), a tau aggregation inhibitor (tai) could have therapeutic utility. methylthioninium (mt) acts as a selective tai in vitro and reduces tau pathology in transgenic mouse models.   objective to determine the minimum safe and effective dose of mt required to prevent disease progression on clinical and functional molecular imaging outcomes.   methods an exploratory double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial of mt (69, 138, and 228 mg/day) was conducted in 321 mild/moderate ad subjects. the primary outcome was change on the alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (adas-cog) at 24 weeks relative to baseline severity. effect of treatment on regional cerebral blood flow decline was determined in a sub-study in 135 subjects. after 24 weeks, subjects were re-consented to enter sequential 6- and 12-month blinded extension phases. registered with clinicaltrials.gov (nct00515333).   results at 24 weeks, there were significant treatment benefits in two independent populations at the 138 mg/day dose: in moderate subjects on the adas-cog scale (treatment effect: -5.42 units, corrected p = 0.047) and two other clinical scales; in mild subjects on the more sensitive regional cerebral blood flow measure (treatment effect: 1.97%, corrected p < 0.001). with continued treatment for 50 weeks, benefit was seen on the adas-cog scale in both mild and moderate subjects. the delivery of the highest dose was impaired due to dose-dependent dissolution and absorption limitations.   conclusion the minimum safe and effective daily mt dose is 138 mg and suggests that further study of mt is warranted in ad.
2'-phosphophloretin (2'-pp), a phosphorylated derivative of the plant chalcone, was synthesized. the effect of 2'-pp, on na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake into intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles (bbmv) isolated from rabbit and rat duodenum and jejunum was examined. 2'-pp decreased na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake into rabbit bbmv with an ic(50) of 55 nm and into rat bbmv with an ic(50) of 58 nm. 2'-pp did not affect na(+)-dependent glucose, na(+)-dependent sulfate, or na(+)-dependent alanine uptake by rabbit intestinal bbmvs. 2'-pp inhibition of rabbit intestinal bbmv na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake was sensitive to external phosphate concentration, suggesting that 2'-pp inhibition of na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake was competitive with respect to phosphate. binding of [(3)h]2'-pp to rabbit intestinal bbmv was examined. binding of [(3)h]2'-pp was na(+)-dependent with a k(0.5) for na(+)(na(+) concentration for 50% 2'-pp binding) of 30 mm. the apparent k(s) for na(+)-dependent [(3)h]2'-pp binding to rabbit bbmvs was 58 nm in agreement with the ic(50) for 2'-pp inhibition of na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake. these results indicate that 2'-pp bound to rabbit or rat intestinal bbmv na(+)-phosphate cotransporter and inhibited na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake. in rats treated with 2'-pp by daily gavage, the effect of 2'-pp on serum phosphate, serum glucose, and serum calcium was examined. in a concentration-dependent manner, 2'-pp reduced serum phosphate by 45% 1 wk after starting treatment. 2'-pp did not alter serum calcium or serum glucose. the apparent ic(50) for 2'-pp in vivo was 3 microm. we examined the effect of phosphonoformic acid (pfa) and phosphonoacetic acid (paa) upon na+-pi cotransport in brush-border membrane (bbm) from small gut of rat. both pfa and paa inhibited the na+ gradient-dependent uptake of 32pi by bbm vesicles (bbmv) prepared from intestinal mucosa but had no effect on na+-dependent uptakes of d-[3h]glucose, l-[3h]proline, or [14c]succinate. the uptake in the absence of na+ gradient, or uptake at equilibrium period (180 min), was not affected by pfa or by paa. a chemical analogue of pfa and paa, phosphonopropionic acid, had only a minor inhibitory effect and phenylphosphonic acid was inactive. neither pfa nor paa influenced the activity of rat intestinal bbm alkaline phosphatase. the bbmv from rat jejunum had a much higher capacity for na+ gradient-dependent uptake of 32pi than bbmv from duodenum or ileum. the inhibition of bbmv 32pi transport across rat jejunum by pfa is competitive. we suggest that pfa and paa are specific inhibitors of na+ gradient-dependent uptake of pi by bbmv from small intestinal mucosa and that they could serve as useful experimental tools for the studies of intestinal na+-pi cotransport.
promoter methylation is a gene- and cancer type-specific epigenetic event that plays an important role in tumour development. as endometrioid (endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, eec) and serous endometrial cancers (uterine papillary serous carcinoma, upsc) exhibit different clinical, histological and molecular genetic characteristics, we hypothesized that these differences may be reflected in epigenetic phenomena as well. identification of a panel of methylation biomarkers could be helpful in a correct histological classification of these two subtypes, which solely on the basis of morphology is not always easy. methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to assess the extent of promoter methylation of different tumour suppressor genes in eec and upsc. methylation results were correlated with histology and survival. the median cumulative methylation index of all genes was significantly higher in eec (124) than in upsc (93) (p<0.001). promoter methylation of cdh13 and mlh1 was more frequently present in eec, while cdkn2b and tp73 were more frequently methylated in upsc. almost 90% of eec and 70% of upsc could be predicted by cdh13 and tp73. in eec, methylation of mlh1 was associated with a shorter disease-free survival (dfs; p<0.0001) and overall survival (os; p=0.005). in a multivariate model, mlh1 methylation emerged as an additional prognostic factor to stage for dfs (p=0.002). in conclusion, promoter methylation is more common in eec than upsc. a panel of methylation biomarkers could be useful to distinguish between the two histological subtypes of endometrial cancer. furthermore, methylation of mlh1 may have prognostic value in eec. purpose: many investigators have reported that aneuploidy detected by flow cytometry is a useful prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer. laser scanning cytometry (lsc) is a technology similar to flow cytometry but is more feasible for clinical laboratory use. we evaluated the usefulness of dna ploidy detected by lsc as a prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer and investigated genetic and epigenetic factors related to aneuploidy. experimental design: endometrial cancer specimens from 106 patients were evaluated. the methylation status of cdh13, rassf1, sfrp1, sfrp2, sfrp4, sfrp5, p16, hmlh1, mgmt, apc, atm, and wif1 and mutations in the p53 and cdc4 genes were investigated. lsc was carried out to determine dna ploidy. fluorescence in situ hybridization was done with chromosome-specific centromeric probes to assess chromosomal instability. results: univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that p53 mutation and lack of cdh13 hypermethylation associated positively with aneuploidy. univariate analysis showed that aneuploidy, chromosomal instability, and lack of cdh13 hypermethylation as well as surgical stage were significantly predictive of death from endometrial cancer. furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that stage in combination with either dna aneuploidy or lack of cdh13 hypermethylation was an independent prognostic factor. conclusion: these results suggest that analysis of dna ploidy and methylation status of cdh13 may help predict clinical outcome in patients with endometrial cancer. prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm the validity of an individualized approach, including determination of tumor ploidy and methylation status of cdh13, to management of endometrial cancer patients.
objective the aim of this study was to assess the functional results of an early onset progressive eccentric and concentric training in patients with autogen hamstring anterior cruciate ligament (acl) reconstruction.   methods thirty-three patients with autogenous hamstring acl reconstruction were randomly divided into study (n=16, mean age; 33.87±8.19) and control (n=17, mean age; 32.64±8.21) groups and followed the same acl rehabilitation program. additionally, the study group followed a progressive eccentric and concentric training for 12 weeks on the monitorized functional squat system (mfss) beginning 3 weeks after surgery. the groups were compared according to the isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors, functional performance (the vertical jump test, a single hop for distance test) and the lysholm knee scale, the anterior cruciate ligament-quality of life questionnaire (acl-qol), before and 16 weeks after the surgery.   results the functional outcomes in terms of the vertical jump test (p=0.012), a single hop-for-distance test (p=0.027), the lysholm knee scale (p=0.002) and the acl-qol questionnaire (p=0.000) demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the study group. no significant difference was reported between groups for isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors (p>0.05).   conclusion adding progressive eccentric and concentric exercises to the standard rehabilitation protocol may improve the functional results after acl reconstruction with autogen hamstring grafts. we report isokinetic results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon or hamstring graft from the literature analysis. the literature was defined from two search "textwords": isokinetic and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and from three databases: medline, pascal, and herasmus. two independent physicians (physical medicine and rehabilitation) carried out an analysis according to the french national accreditation and health evaluation agency recommendations. fifty-three studies were selected: 29 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft, 15 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring graft, and 9 studies compared the two surgical procedures. after discussing different bias and in reference to prospective randomised and comparative studies, the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft involves a knee extensors deficit during several months. the hamstring surgical procedure involves a less important knee extensor deficit (from 6 to 19 % against 8 to 21 %). knee sprain and intra-articular surgery involve a long-lasting knee extensors deficit. anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings graft involves a knee flexors deficit over several months. the patellar tendon surgical procedure involves a less important knee flexors deficit (from 1 to 15 % against 5 to 17 %). in reference to isokinetic parameters, no difference between the two surgical procedures (patellar tendon graft or hamstring graft) is shown after more than twenty-four post-surgical months.
overactive ras signaling is prevalent in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (jmml) and the myeloproliferative variant of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (mp-cmml) in humans, and both are refractory to conventional chemotherapy. conditional activation of a constitutively active oncogenic nras (nrasg12d/g12d) in murine hematopoietic cells promotes an acute myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn) that recapitulates many features of jmml and mp-cmml. we found that nrasg12d/g12d-expressing hscs, which serve as jmml/mp-cmml-initiating cells, show strong hyperactivation of erk1/2, promoting hyperproliferation and depletion of hscs and expansion of downstream progenitors. inhibition of the mek pathway alone prolonged the presence of nrasg12d/g12d-expressing hscs but failed to restore their proper function. consequently, approximately 60% of nrasg12d/g12d mice treated with mek inhibitor alone died within 20 weeks, and the remaining animals continued to display jmml/mp-cmml-like phenotypes. in contrast, combined inhibition of mek and jak/stat signaling, which is commonly hyperactivated in human and mouse cmml, potently inhibited human and mouse cmml cell growth in vitro, rescued mutant nrasg12d/g12d-expressing hsc function in vivo, and promoted long-term survival without evident disease manifestation in nrasg12d/g12d animals. these results provide a strong rationale for further exploration of combined targeting of mek/erk and jak/stat in treating patients with jmml and mp-cmml. activating mutations in the ras oncogene are not considered sufficient to induce abnormal cellular proliferation in the absence of cooperating oncogenes. we demonstrate that the conditional expression of an endogenous k-ras(g12d) allele in murine embryonic fibroblasts causes enhanced proliferation and partial transformation in the absence of further genetic abnormalities. interestingly, k-ras(g12d)-expressing fibroblasts demonstrate attenuation and altered regulation of canonical ras effector signaling pathways. widespread expression of endogenous k-ras(g12d) is not tolerated during embryonic development, and directed expression in the lung and gi tract induces preneoplastic epithelial hyperplasias. our results suggest that endogenous oncogenic ras is sufficient to initiate transformation by stimulating proliferation, while further genetic lesions may be necessary for progression to frank malignancy.
medulloblastoma (mb) is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling drives a minority of mb, correlating with desmoplastic pathology and favorable outcome. the majority, however, arises independently of shh and displays classic or large cell anaplastic (lca) pathology and poor prognosis. to identify common signaling abnormalities, we profiled mrna, demonstrating misexpression of mycn in the majority of human mb and negligible expression in normal cerebella. we clarified a role in pathogenesis by targeting mycn (and luciferase) to cerebella of transgenic mice. mycn-driven mb showed either classic or lca pathologies, with shh signaling activated in approximately 5% of tumors, demonstrating that mycn can drive mb independently of shh. mb arose at high penetrance, consistent with a role for mycn in initiation. tumor burden correlated with bioluminescence, with rare metastatic spread to the leptomeninges, suggesting roles for mycn in both progression and metastasis. transient pharmacological down-regulation of mycn led to both clearance and senescence of tumor cells, and improved survival. targeted expression of mycn thus contributes to initiation, progression, and maintenance of mb, suggesting a central role for mycn in pathogenesis. the patched (ptc) gene encodes a sonic hedgehog (shh) receptor and a tumor suppressor protein that is defective in basal cell nevus syndrome (bcns). functions of ptc were investigated by inactivating the mouse gene. mice homozygous for the ptc mutation died during embryogenesis and were found to have open and overgrown neural tubes. two shh target genes, ptc itself and gli, were derepressed in the ectoderm and mesoderm but not in the endoderm. shh targets that are, under normal conditions, transcribed ventrally were aberrantly expressed in dorsal and lateral neural tube cells. thus ptc appears to be essential for repression of genes that are locally activated by shh. mice heterozygous for the ptc mutation were larger than normal, and a subset of them developed hindlimb defects or cerebellar medulloblastomas, abnormalities also seen in bcns patients.
twenty landraces of cowpea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp.) scattered throughout algeria were compared through morphological and genetic characterization. at the morphological level, for qualitative characters there was no intra-landrace variation and for quantitative characters the variations were low except for landrace nag2 three different cultigroups were located in algeria: biflora that was dominant in the sahara, melanophtalmus in the north and unguiculata including one landrace in kabylia and two in sahara. the amova analysis indicated that the genetic variation was lower within than among agro-ecological regions. a mantel test, revealed a correlation between the qualitative morphological data and the geographical data (r = 0.28; p < 0.01), indicating that the degree of morphological change among landraces was roughly proportional to the geographical distances separating them. genetic diversity was analyzed by using 11 random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and 12 inter-simple sequence repeat (issr) markers. no intra-landrace variability was found. the eleven rapd primers yielded 77 bands, of which 45 (58.44%) were polymorphic; the genetic similarity ranged from 66.0 to 96.7%. the twelve issr primers provided a total of 104 bands, of which 65 (62.5%) were polymorphic; the genetic similarity ranged from 62.8 to 97.8%. cluster analysis showed a good match between genetic background and geographical distribution, which was confirmed by the results of the mantel test. in particular, geographical data and genetic data were found to be correlated: (r = 0.33; p < 0.01) for rapd, (r = 0.37; p < 0.01) for issr, and (r = 0.33; p < 0.01) for a combined rapd-issr dataset. moreover, despite the absence of significant correlation between morphological and rapd data (r = 0.14; p = 0.14), significant correlations between morphological data and both issr (r = 0.27, p < 0.05) and a combined rapd-issr dataset (r = 0.22, p < 0.05) were noted. issr markers were better linked to morphological variation than were rapd markers. however, despite this, genetic distances among these landraces were found to be essentially the same no matter which markers were used. patterns of phenotypic and phenetic variability in sixportuguese cultivars of chestnut (castanea sativa mill.) are evaluated. morphological characterisationwas based on the quantification of seventeen traits. varianceanalysis showed significant differences among cultivars, and cultivar× year for all the traits studied, and trees within cultivarsshowed also some significant differences for some of themorphological variables. a significant correlation was obtainedbetween length of the leaf blade and the percentage of unisexual andandrogynic inflorescence with the effective thermal index,accumulated rainfall from april to october and from july to october,or the accumulated temperature below seven during the dormant period.principal component and cluster analysis were performed to group thecultivars, according to their similarity coefficients. for molecularcharacterisation, 125 rapd and 157 issr polymorphic markers wereamplified using 28 and 7 primers respectively. high level ofcongruence among the two marker systems (r =90.5%) was obtained from comparison of pheneticsimilarities based on the percentage of shared fragments. issrmarkers revealed important advantages over rapds, due to a higheffective multiplex ratio (12.5 for issr compared with 2.2 forrapd analysis) and reproducibility. although morphological andmolecular results are comparable, slight differences are showed incluster analysis upgma dendrograms. molecular analysis explainedhomonym situations among 'martainha' and'longal' cultivars in portugal.
adenosine triphosphate (atp) is a ubiquitous extracellular messenger elevated in the tumor microenvironment. atp regulates cell functions by acting on purinergic receptors (p2x and p2y) and activating a series of intracellular signaling pathways. we examined atp-induced ca(2+) signaling and its effects on antiapoptotic (bcl-2) and proapoptotic (bax) proteins in normal human airway epithelial cells and lung cancer cells. lung cancer cells exhibited two phases (transient and plateau phases) of increase in cytosolic [ca(2+)] ([ca(2+)]cyt) caused by atp, while only the transient phase was observed in normal cells. removal of extracellular ca(2+) eliminated the plateau phase increase of [ca(2+)]cyt in lung cancer cells, indicating that the plateau phase of [ca(2+)]cyt increase is due to ca(2+) influx. the distribution of p2x (p2x1-7) and p2y (p2y1, p2y2, p2y4, p2y6, p2y11) receptors was different between lung cancer cells and normal cells. proapoptotic p2x7 was nearly undetectable in lung cancer cells, which may explain why lung cancer cells showed decreased cytotoxicity when treated with high concentration of atp. the bcl-2/bax ratio was increased in lung cancer cells following treatment with atp; however, the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 demonstrated more sensitivity to atp than proapoptotic protein bax. decreasing extracellular ca(2+) or chelating intracellular ca(2+) with bapta-am significantly inhibited atp-induced increase in bcl-2/bax ratio, indicating that a rise in [ca(2+)]cyt through ca(2+) influx is the critical mediator for atp-mediated increase in bcl-2/bax ratio. therefore, despite high atp levels in the tumor microenvironment, which would induce cell apoptosis in normal cells, the decreased p2x7 and elevated bcl-2/bax ratio in lung cancer cells may enable tumor cells to survive. increasing the bcl-2/bax ratio by exposure to high extracellular atp may, therefore, be an important selective pressure promoting transformation and cancer progression. cholesterol-lowering statins have been shown to inhibit growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. epidemiological studies also indicate a chemopreventive effect of statins. we have investigated the effect of statins on akt/protein kinase b signaling. we found that atorvastatin decreased constitutive- and insulin-induced pakt in panc-1 and mia paca-2 cells. statins also inhibited pakt in combination with gemcitabine- and 5-fluorouracil, and sensitized cells to gemcitabine- and 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. in line with our previous data, it was found that the p2x7-purinergic receptor mediated the effects of statins in panc-1 and mia paca-2 cells. thus, experiments employing p2x7 sirna and inhibitors supported an involvement of p2x7. in capan-2 cells, which expressed p2x7 in low levels, statins did not reduce pakt levels nor did statins sensitize them to cytostatic drugs. however, statin inhibited the growth of capan-2 cells and this correlated to inhibition of nfkappab and raf/mek pathways. as shown previously, these latter effects can be explained by an inhibited protein prenylation. our data suggest that statins primarily target a functional p2x7-akt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. by targeting the p2x7-akt axis, statins can sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. our data are also in line with a role for p2x7 in the chemopreventive effect of statins on pancreatic cancer.
effective and accurate detection of alzheimer's disease (ad) at its early stage has been being paid more and more attention. however, most of existing researches have just focused on a single modality of imaging for diagnosis of ad. although a single modality might be provides some meaningful information for diagnosing the disease, it still is difficult to meet the need of clinical diagnosis. with the fast development of multi-modality imaging such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (smri) and positron emission tomography (pet), combination of multi-modality has an opportunity to provide much more useful information to enhance the better performance of diagnosis of ad than that of a single one alone. the integration of the complementary information afforded by multimodal imaging protocols into a comprehensive analysis strategy is likely to aid in better discrimination and staging of ad. in the study, we proposed a method based on independent component analysis and support vector machine by combining smri and pet images to carry out the classification of ad subjects from healthy controls (hc). the experimental results illustrated that the classification between ad and hc subjects from the alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative database was obtained with the averaged accuracy of 96.53% for multimodal images at baseline, comparing to 88.95% for only smri images and 89.44% for only pet images. the multimodal classification approach hence allows more accurate early detection of brain abnormalities with greater sensitivity. we present a novel method to extract classification features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) data collected at rest or during the performance of a task. by combining a two-level feature identification scheme with kernel principal component analysis (kpca) and fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (fld), we achieve high classification rates in discriminating healthy controls from patients with schizophrenia. experimental results using leave-one-out cross-validation show that features extracted from the default mode network (dmn) lead to a classification accuracy of over 90% in both data sets. moreover, using a majority vote method that uses multiple features, we achieve a classification accuracy of 98% in auditory oddball (aod) task and 93% in rest data. several components, including dmn, temporal, and medial visual regions, are consistently present in the set of features that yield high classification accuracy. the features we have extracted thus show promise to be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia. results also suggest that there may be different advantages to using resting fmri data or task fmri data.
to determine the prenatal factors associated with the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) and neonatal survival in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh). to investigate whether the prediction of postnatal outcome of fetuses with isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia depends on the gestational age at assessment using the fetal observed to expected (o/e) lung area to head circumference ratio (lhr), by comparing the performance of the test at 22–23 weeks with that at 32–33 weeks of gestation.
the present study demonstrated the combined effect of 24-epibrassinolide and salicylic acid against lead (pb, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mm) toxicity in brassica juncea seedlings. various parameters including water status, metal uptake, total water- and lipid-soluble antioxidants, metal chelator content (total thiols, protein-bound thiols, and non-protein-bound thiols), phenolic compounds (flavonoids, anthocyanins, and polyphenols), and organic acids were studied in 10-day-old seedlings. dry matter content and the heavy metal tolerance index were reduced by 42.24 and 52.3%, respectively, in response to pb treatment. metal uptake, metal-chelating compounds, phenolic compounds, and organic acids were increased in pb-treated seedlings as compared to control plants. the treatment of pb-stressed seedlings with combination of ebl and sa resulted in enhancement of heavy metal tolerance index by 40.07%, water content by 1.84%, and relative water content by 23.45%. the total water- and lipid-soluble antioxidants were enhanced by 21.01 and 2.21%, respectively. in contrast, a significant decline in dry weight, metal uptake, thiol, and polyphenol contents was observed following the application of 24-epibrassinolide and salicylic acid. these observations indicate that pb treatment has an adverse effect on b. juncea seedlings. however, co-application of 24-epibrassinolide and salicylic acid mitigates the negative effects of pb, by lowering pb metal uptake and enhancing the heavy metal tolerance index, water content, relative water content, antioxidative capacities, phenolic content, and organic acid levels. the phenolics: anthocyanin (ath), sinapoyl esters and activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat), guaiacol peroxidase (pox), ascorbate peroxidase (apx), glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and glutathione reductase (gr), in red cabbage seedlings subjected to cu2+ stress were investigated. cu2+ at low doses (0.5 mm), increased the levels of ath and sinapoyl derivatives in red cabbage. high cu2+ concentration (2.5 mm) provoked oxidative stress and enhanced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) content in tissues. a lower level of tbars was correlated with high ath content. it seems that synthesis of these isoflavonoids is an effective strategy against reactive oxygen species (ros). the analysis of the antioxidant enzymes activity suggested that peroxidases were the most active enzymes in red cabbage seedlings exposed to cu2+ stress. it could results from the fact that phenolic compounds (phc), which could be also substrates for different peroxidases, were the first line of defence against metal stress.
mice are a widely used animal model for investigating cardiovascular disease. novel technologies have been used to quantify left ventricular function in this species, but techniques appropriate for determining right ventricular (rv) function are less well demonstrated. detecting rv dysfunction is critical to assessing the progression of pulmonary vascular diseases such as pulmonary hypertension. we used an admittance catheter to measure pressure-volume loops in anesthetized, open-chested mice before and during vena cava occlusion. mice exposed to chronic hypoxia for 10 days, which causes hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (hph), were compared with control (ctl) mice. hph resulted in a 27.9% increase in rv mass (p < 0.005), a 67.5% increase in rv systolic pressure (p < 0.005), and a 61.2% decrease in cardiac output (p < 0.05). preload recruitable stroke work (prsw) and slope of the maximum derivative of pressure (dp/dt(max))-end-diastolic volume (edv) relationship increased with hph (p < 0.05). although hph increased effective arterial elastance (e(a)) over fivefold (from 2.7 ± 1.2 to 16.4 ± 2.5 mmhg/μl), only a mild increase in the ventricular end-systolic elastance (e(es)) was observed. as a result, a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of ventricular-vascular coupling occurred (e(es)/e(a) decreased from 0.71 ± 0.27 to 0.35 ± 0.17; p < 0.005). changes in cardiac reserve were evaluated by dobutamine infusion. in ctl mice, dobutamine significantly enhanced e(es) and dp/dt(max)-edv but also increased e(a), causing a decrease in e(es)/e(a). in hph mice, slight but nonsignificant decreases in e(es), prsw, dp/dt(max)-edv, and e(a) were observed. thus 10 days of hph resulted in rv hypertrophy, ventricular-vascular decoupling, and a mild decrease in rv contractile reserve. this study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining rv pressure-volume measurements in mice. these measurements provide insight into ventricular-vascular interactions healthy and diseased states. global assessment of both cardiac and arterial function is important for a meaningful interpretation of pathophysiological changes in animal models of cardiovascular disease. we simultaneously acquired left ventricular (lv) and aortic pressure and lv volume (v(lv)) in 17 open-chest anesthetized mice (26.7 +/- 3.2g) during steady-state (bl) and caval vein occlusion (vco) using a 1.4-fr dual-pressure conductance catheter and in a subgroup of eight animals during aortic occlusion (aoo). aortic flow was obtained from numerical differentiation of v(lv). aoo increased input impedance (z(in)) for the first two harmonics, increased characteristic impedance (0.025 +/- 0.007 to 0.040 +/- 0.011 mmhg x microl(-1) x s, p < 0.05), and shifted the minimum in z(in) from the third to the sixth harmonic. for all conditions, the z(in) could be well represented by a four-element windkessel model. the augmentation index increased from 116.7 +/- 7.8% to 145.9 +/- 19.5% (p < 0.01) as well as estimated pulse-wave velocity (3.50 +/- 0.94 to 5.95 +/- 1.62 m/s, p < 0.05) and arterial elastance (e(a), 4.46 +/- 1.62 to 6.02 +/- 1.43 mmhg/microl, p < 0.01). aoo altered the maximal slope (e(max), 3.23 +/- 1.02 to 5.53 +/- 1.53 mmhg/microl, p < 0.05) and intercept (-19.9 +/- 8.6 to 1.62 +/- 13.51 microl, p < 0.01) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation but not e(a)/e(max) (1.44 +/- 0.43 to 1.21 +/- 0.37, not significant). we conclude that simultaneous acquisition of z(in) and arterial function parameters in the mouse, based solely on conductance catheter measurements, is feasible. we obtained an anticipated response of z(in) and arterial function parameters following vco and aoo, demonstrating the sensitivity of the measuring technique to induced physiological alterations in murine hemodynamics.
granule cell dispersion is a characteristic feature of ammon's horn sclerosis in temporal lobe epilepsy. it was recently shown that granule cell dispersion is associated with decreased expression of the extracellular matrix protein reelin. reelin controls neuronal lamination and the differentiation of dendrites and spines. here, we studied dendritic orientation and the distribution of dendritic spines on granule cells in surgical specimens of patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy. in this material, we compared granule cells in dentate areas showing granule cell dispersion with granule cells in areas exhibiting a normal, densely packed granule cell layer. granule cells (gc) were golgi-stained and analyzed using a computer-based camera lucida system and were categorized as being located proximal or distal to the hilus (gcprox, gcdist). we found that gcprox in a densely packed granule cell layer exhibited a mainly vertically oriented dendritic arbor with a small bifurcation angle (17°) between branching dendrites. in contrast, gcdist in a densely packed granular layer showed a wider bifurcation angle (35°), suggesting a widening of the dendritic field during the migratory process to superficial positions. granule cells in the dispersed granule cell layer showed an even wider bifurcation angle of their apical dendrites (gcprox: 40°; gcdist: 58°) and also exhibited recurrent basal dendrites. spine density on dendrites of gcprox in dispersed areas was increased compared to gcprox in the normal, compact granule cell layer. in contrast, dendrites of gcdist extending into the molecular layer showed a reduced spine density in dispersed areas. the results are discussed in view of other findings on neuronal reorganization in the epileptic dentate gyrus. the distribution of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation was studied in control autopsy and temporal lobe epilepsy (tle) specimens. in control tissue, the granule cell somata were closely approximated and formed a narrow lamina with a distinct, regular border with the molecular layer. in 11 of 15 tle specimens, the granule cell somata were dispersed and formed a wider than normal granule cell layer. the granule cell somata extended into the molecular layer to varying extents, creating an irregular boundary between the lamina. the dispersed granule cells were frequently aligned in columns, and many of these neurons displayed elongated bipolar forms. the extent of granule cell dispersion appeared to be related to the amount of cell loss in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus. granule cell dispersion was not consistently associated with granule cell loss although 5 of the 11 specimens with granule cell dispersion also showed moderate to marked granule cell loss. the most common features in the histories of the tle cases with granule cell dispersion were severe febrile seizures or seizures associated with meningitis or encephalitis during the first 4 years of life. the dispersion of the granule cells suggests that there has been some alteration in the patterns of cell migration in a subpopulation of cases with severe tle. the resultant ectopic positions of the granule cells could lead to changes in both the afferent and efferent connections of these neurons and, thus, contribute to the altered circuitry of the hippocampal formation in tle.
increased oxidative stress can help promote carcinogenesis, including development of renal cell carcinoma. the enzyme protects low-density lipoproteins from oxidation and can be a factor in this process. pon1 q192r and l55m paraoxonase gene polymorphisms were assessed in 60 renal cell carcinoma patients and 60 healthy controls. genotypes were examined by pcr; the restriction enzyme alwi was used to examine the q192r polymorphism and hsp92ii for the l55m polymorphism. significant differences in the pon1 q192r polymorphism were found between patients and controls. the q allele was more frequent in the patient group than in controls, while the r allele was more frequent in the control group. no significant differences were found in the l55m polymorphism. additionally, there were no significant differences in l and m allele frequencies. we conclude that the r allele may protect against renal cell carcinoma. oxidative modification of low‐density lipoprotein (ldl) enhances its uptake by macrophages in tissue culture and in vivo may underly the formation of arterial fatty streaks, the progenitors of atheroma. we investigated the possible protection which high‐density lipoprotein (hdl) affords against ldl oxidation. the formation of lipoperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances when ldl was incubated with copper ions was significantly decreased by hdl. the enzyme, paraoxonase (e.c. 3.1.8.1), purified from human hdl, had a similar effect and thus may be the component of hdl responsible for decreasing the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products.
significance what a person says is not necessarily an accurate representation of what she thinks. implicit attitudes permeate every aspect of our life. the implicit association test (iat)—the most well-known test of implicit attitudes—is a reaction time measure. so far, the fundamental question about the source of its reaction time differences, i.e., the iat effect, has remained unanswered. for the first time to our knowledge in iat research, we applied a sophisticated electrical neuroimaging approach—the microstate approach. superior to other approaches, the microstate approach allowed us to identify and time the entire chain of mental processes as they unfolded during the iat. we found that reaction time differences are due to quantitative and not qualitative differences in the underlying mental processes. why do people take longer to associate the word “love” with outgroup words (incongruent condition) than with ingroup words (congruent condition)? despite the widespread use of the implicit association test (iat), it has remained unclear whether this iat effect is due to additional mental processes in the incongruent condition, or due to longer duration of the same processes. here, we addressed this previously insoluble issue by assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of brain electrical activity in 83 participants. from stimulus presentation until response production, we identified seven processes. crucially, all seven processes occurred in the same temporal sequence in both conditions, but participants needed more time to perform one early occurring process (perceptual processing) and one late occurring process (implementing cognitive control to select the motor response) in the incongruent compared with the congruent condition. we also found that the latter process contributed to individual differences in implicit bias. these results advance understanding of the neural mechanics of response time differences in the iat: they speak against theories that explain the iat effect as due to additional processes in the incongruent condition and speak in favor of theories that assume a longer duration of specific processes in the incongruent condition. more broadly, our data analysis approach illustrates the potential of electrical neuroimaging to illuminate the temporal organization of mental processes involved in social cognition. in order to investigate the systems underlying the automatic and controlled processes that support social attitudes, we conducted an fmri study that combined an implicit measure of race attitudes with the quadruple process model (quad model). a number of previous neural investigations have adopted the implicit association test (iat) to examine the automatic processes that contribute to social attitudes. application of the quad model builds on this previous research by permitting measures of distinct automatic and controlled processes that contribute to performance on the iat. the present research found that prejudiced attitudes of ingroup favoritism were associated with amygdala, medial and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex. in contrast, prejudiced attitudes of outgroup negativity were associated with caudate and left lateral orbitofrontal cortex. frontal regions found in previous neural research on the iat, such as anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and operculum were associated with detecting appropriate responses in situations in which they conflict with automatic associations. insula activity was associated with attitudes towards ingroup and outgroup members, as well as detecting appropriate behavior.
inositol phospholipids play a crucial role in all aspects of cell biology, from cell survival, differentiation and migration, to immune function, organ development and tumor growth. their production is carefully regulated by a wide range of lipid kinases and phosphatases (1,2). the most studied of these is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k), which produces the phosphoinositides (phosphatidyl inositol phosphates [pips]) ptdins(3)p1, ptdins(3,4)p2 and ptdins(3,4,5)p3. the last phospholipid [ptdins(3,4,5)p3] acts as second messenger by binding ph domain–containing proteins such as protein kinase b (pkb/akt), implicated in cell survival. many tumors, including breast cancer and hematological malignancies such as the plasma cell neoplasm multiple myeloma (mm), present with constitutive activation of the pi3k-akt pathway (3). activating mutations in the pi3k gene (pik3ca) have been described, but constitutive pi3k signaling may also occur as a secondary effect (4). activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases or ras, oncogenic translocation products, and cytokine signaling loops have also been described as contributing factors (5,6). regardless of the activating mechanism, targeting the pi3k/akt pathway with specific inhibitors is believed to be a promising approach in treating cancer (7,8). pi3k signaling is generally thought to be counteracted by lipid phosphatases. one of these is the phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten), which hydrolyzes ptdins(3,4,5)p3 to ptdins(4,5)p2, thereby decreasing the pi3k-induced survival signal and acting as a tumor suppressor (reviewed in [9]). others are the sh2-domain containing inositol 5′ polyphosphatases: sh2 domaincontaining inositol-5′-phosphatase 1 (ship1) and ship2, which dephosphorylate inositol lipids at the 5d position of the inositol ring, when a phosphate is present at the 3d position, thereby generating ptdins(3,4)p2. ship1 and ship2 share 38% sequence homology, but may abstract phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) activation and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (pi-3,4-p2) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (pi-3,4,5-p3) lipids mediate growth factor signaling that leads to cell proliferation, migration, and survival. pi3k-dependent activation of akt is critical for myoblast differentiation induced by serum withdrawal, suggesting that in these cells pi3k signaling is activated in an unconventional manner. here we investigate the mechanisms by which pi3k signaling and akt are regulated during myogenesis. we report that pi-3,4-p2 and pi-3,4,5-p3 accumulated in the plasma membranes of serum-starved 3t3-l6 myoblasts due to de novo synthesis and increased lipid stability. surprisingly, only newly synthesized lipids were capable of activating akt. knockdown of the lipid phosphatase pten moderately increased pi3k lipids but significantly increased akt phosphorylation and promoted myoblast differentiation. knockdown of the lipid phosphatase ship2, on the other hand, dramatically increased the steady-state levels of pi-3,4,5-p3 but did not affect akt phosphorylation and increased apoptotic cell death. together, these results reveal the existence of two distinct pools of pi3k lipids in differentiating 3t3-l6 myoblasts: a pool of nascent lipids that is mainly dephosphorylated by pten and is capable of activating akt and promoting myoblast differentiation and a stable pool that is dephosphorylated by ship2 and is unable to activate akt.
a large number of genera in the tropical fish family characidae are incertae sedis. cytogenetic analysis was made of four of these species: astyanax eigenmanniorum, deuterodon stigmaturus, hyphessobrycon luetkenii, and h. anisitsi, collected from various hydrographic basins: hydrographic system from laguna dos patos/rs, tramandaí basin/rs and tibagi river basin/pr. the first two species were collected in their type locality in the state of rio grande do sul. the 2n = 48 karyotype was observed only in a. eigenmanniorum, while the other species had 2n = 50 chromosomes, with different karyotypic formulas. there was weak heterochromatin staining in the pericentromeric region of a. eigenmanniorum, d. stigmaturus and h. luetkenni chromosomes. in h. anisitsi, heterochromatin appeared to be more abundant and distributed in the pericentromeric and terminal regions of the chromosomes; three pairs showed more evident heterochromatic blocks. there were multiple ag-nors in all populations, visualized by fish with an 18s rdna probe. while d. stigmaturus and h. luetkenii had conserved agnor, cma3 and 18s rdna sites, the other two species showed intra- and interindividual variation at these sites. the karyotype variability was high, as is common in this group of fish. different species arising from isolated hydrographic basins maintain an elevated level of karyotype differentiation, mainly with respect to chromosome structure, heterochromatin distribution and rdna localization. this is the first report with cytogenetic data for d. stigmaturus and h. luetkenii. a cytogenetic study was conducted on an astyanax eigenmanniorum population from the caetano stream (18° 44' 56" s/ 048° 18' 39" w) - in uberlândia, mg, brazil - showing a modal diploid number of 48 chromosomes in the standard male and female karyotypes. however, in several specimens it was also possible to observe metaphases with one or two b chromosomes, increasing the diploid number to 49 or 50 chromosomes, respectively. the supernumerary chromosomes were totally heterochromatic and highlighted after c-banding. the silver-stained nucleolus organizing regions (ag-nors) were located in at least five chromosomes of the standard karyotype, thus characterizing a multiple nor system in the species. this is the first occurrence of an a. eigenmanniorum population with 2n = 48 chromosomes, bearing supernumerary chromosomes.
background models for the production of knowledge and systems of innovation and science are key elements for characterizing a country in view of its scientific thematic profile. with regard to scientific output and publication in journals of international visibility, the countries of the world may be classified into three main groups according to their thematic bias. methodology/principal findings this paper aims to classify the countries of the world in several broad groups, described in terms of behavioural models that attempt to sum up the characteristics of their systems of knowledge and innovation. we perceive three clusters in our analysis: 1) the biomedical cluster, 2) the basic science & engineering cluster, and 3) the agricultural cluster. the countries are conceptually associated with the clusters via principal component analysis (pca), and a multidimensional scaling (mds) map with all the countries is presented. conclusions/significance as we have seen, insofar as scientific output and publication in journals of international visibility is concerned, the countries of the world may be classified into three main groups according to their thematic profile. these groups can be described in terms of behavioral models that attempt to sum up the characteristics of their systems of knowledge and innovation. the inherited disciplinary structure of the science of post-communist countries of cee carries a strong common features of its past. the communist heritage is present in: a) a relatively homogeneous research profile among post-communist countries; b) the similar structure of disciplinary comparative advantages of post-communist countries; c) the unbalanced and concentrated disciplinary structure of comparative advantages. the analysis is based on isi databases and uses statistics on papers and citations for the 1992–1997 period for all central and eastern european countries as well as for other world regions. in the conclusions we discuss the relevance of the results for the restructuring of science in the countries of central and eastern europe.
summary the limits to sustained energy intake (susei) are important because they determine the ceiling restricting all the competing physiological processes. a recent hypothesis is that susei is constrained by the capacity to dissipate heat. however some previous data for swiss mice are inconsistent with this hypothesis. to examine the role of limits to heat dissipation on susei, the body temperature, thermal conductance and lactation performance were measured in dorsally shaved swiss mice. shaving reduces external insulation and the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis predicts such animals should be capable of eating more food and raising heavier litters. shaved mice had a significantly higher thermal conductance and a faster reduction in body temperature following noradrenaline injection. at peak lactation, shaved mice spent more time in feeding behaviour, and increased food intake above that observed in non-shaved controls, indicating that limits on susei might be imposed by the capacity to dissipate heat. however, shaved females did not spend more time suckling their pups, and did not raise heavier litters, which is inconsistent with the expectations of the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis. the strong correlations between resting, feeding and suckling behaviour at peak lactation suggested that there might be a trade-off in the time distribution between the behavioural patterns. these data suggest that limits on performance may be set at different levels in different strains or species. in mf1 mice studied previously the limit on milk production imposed by maximal mammary secretion capability may lie above that for heat dissipation, hence when the latter was increased the mice produced more milk and raised heavier litters. in swiss mice the opposite might be the case. hence when the heat dissipation capacity was increased this did not translate into heavier litters, i.e. supporting the peripheral limitation hypothesis. further work in a range of additional species or strains will be necessary to establish whether the more normal condition is for susei in animals during late lactation to be set by combined peripheral demands or by the heat dissipation capacity. using lactation in mice as a model, we sought to determine whether ceilings on sustained energy expenditure reside in the capacities of energy-acquiring and input organs (such as the intestine) or of energy-expending and output organs (such as the mammary glands). to distinguish between these possibilities experimentally, we surgically varied the teat number of lactating mother mice while simultaneously varying their litter size. the energy burden on each teat (i.e. the pup/teat ratio) could thus be varied independently of the energy burden (i.e. litter size) on the mother herself or on her intestine. at each teat number, pup mass proved to be maximal at intermediate litter sizes. at a given pup/teat ratio, mothers with five teats weaned pups no larger than the pups of normal (10-teat) mothers, even though the total energy burden on the former mothers was only half as large. mothers with only two teats could not wean any pups. litter size controlled maternal food intake, which in turn controlled intestinal mass and nutrient uptake capacity. disproportionately high food intake for the smallest litters appears to reflect capital start-up costs of lactation. pup mass is evidently limited by inadequate suckling stimulation of mammary glands.
learning and exploiting problem structure is one of the key challenges in optimization. this is especially important for black-box optimization (bbo) where prior structural knowledge of a problem is not available. existing model-based evolutionary algorithms (eas) are very efficient at learning structure in both the discrete, and in the continuous domain. in this article, discrete and continuous model-building mechanisms are integrated for the mixed-integer (mi) domain, comprising discrete and continuous variables. we revisit a recently introduced model-based evolutionary algorithm for the mi domain, the genetic algorithm for model-based mixed-integer optimization (gambit). we extend gambit with a parameterless scheme that allows for practical use of the algorithm without the need to explicitly specify any parameters. we furthermore contrast gambit with other model-based alternatives. the ultimate goal of processing mixed dependences explicitly in gambit is also addressed by introducing a new mechanism for the explicit exploitation of mixed dependences. we find that processing mixed dependences with this novel mechanism allows for more efficient optimization. we further contrast the parameterless gambit with mixed-integer evolution strategies (mies) and other state-of-the-art mi optimization algorithms from the general algebraic modeling system (gams) commercial algorithm suite on problems with and without constraints, and show that gambit is capable of solving problems where variable dependences prevent many algorithms from successfully optimizing them. evolution strategies (ess) are powerful probabilistic search and optimization algorithms gleaned from biological evolution theory. they have been successfully applied to a wide range of real world applications. the modern ess are mainly designed for solving continuous parameter optimization problems. their ability to adapt the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution used for mutation during the optimization run makes them well suited for this domain. in this article we describe and study mixed integer evolution strategies (mies), which are natural extensions of es for mixed integer optimization problems. mies can deal with parameter vectors consisting not only of continuous variables but also with nominal discrete and integer variables. following the design principles of the canonical evolution strategies, they use specialized mutation operators tailored for the aforementioned mixed parameter classes. for each type of variable, the choice of mutation operators is governed by a natural metric for this variable type, maximal entropy, and symmetry considerations. all distributions used for mutation can be controlled in their shape by means of scaling parameters, allowing self-adaptation to be implemented. after introducing and motivating the conceptual design of the mies, we study the optimality of the self-adaptation of step sizes and mutation rates on a generalized (weighted) sphere model. moreover, we prove global convergence of the mies on a very general class of problems. the remainder of the article is devoted to performance studies on artificial landscapes (barrier functions and mixed integer nk landscapes), and a case study in the optimization of medical image analysis systems. in addition, we show that with proper constraint handling techniques, mies can also be applied to classical mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
highlights • childhood victimization predicted elevated levels of crp at age 18.• the association between child victimization and crp levels was specific to females.• latent genetic influences on crp levels did not explain the association in females. to identify molecular mechanisms by which early life social conditions might influence adult risk of disease in rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta), we analyze changes in basal leukocyte gene expression profiles in 4-mo-old animals reared under adverse social conditions. compared with the basal condition of maternal rearing (mr), leukocytes from peer-reared (pr) animals and pr animals provided with an inanimate surrogate mother (surrogate/peer reared, spr) show enhanced expression of genes involved in inflammation, cytokine signaling, and t-lymphocyte activation, and suppression of genes involved in several innate antimicrobial defenses including type i interferon (ifn) antiviral responses. promoter-based bioinformatic analyses implicate increased activity of creb and nf-κb transcription factors and decreased activity of ifn response factors (irfs) in structuring the observed differences in gene expression. transcript origin analyses identify monocytes and cd4+ t lymphocytes as primary cellular mediators of transcriptional up-regulation and b lymphocytes as major sources of down-regulated genes. these findings show that adverse social conditions can become embedded within the basal transcriptome of primate immune cells within the first 4 mo of life, and they implicate sympathetic nervous system-linked transcription control pathways as candidate mediators of those effects and potential targets for health-protective intervention.
african animal trypanosomosis is a parasitic blood disease transmitted by tsetse flies and is widespread in sub-saharan africa. west african taurine breeds have the ability, known as trypanotolerance, to limit parasitaemia and anaemia and remain productive in enzootic areas. several quantitative trait loci (qtl) underlying traits related to trypanotolerance have been identified in an experimentally infected f(2) population resulting from a cross between taurine and zebu cattle. although this information is highly valuable, the qtl remain to be confirmed in populations subjected to natural conditions of infection, and the corresponding regions need to be refined. in our study, 360 west african cattle were phenotyped for the packed cell volume control under natural conditions of infection in south-western burkina faso. phenotypes were assessed by analysing data from previous cattle monitored over 2 years in an area enzootic for trypanosomosis. we further genotyped for 64 microsatellite markers mapping within four previously reported qtl on bta02, bta04, bta07 and bta13. these data enabled us to estimate the heritability of the phenotype using the kinship matrix between individuals computed from genotyping data. thus, depending on the estimators considered and the method used, the heritability of anaemia control ranged from 0.09 to 0.22. finally, an analysis of association identified an allele of the mnb42 marker on bta04 as being strongly associated with anaemia control, and a candidate gene, inhba, as being close to that marker. one hundred and forty six calving interval records were built up from 64 n'dama cows maintained for 3.5 years under a high natural tsetse challenge in zaire. matching health and performance data were recorded monthly to allow simultaneous evaluation of the effects of different criteria of trypanotolerance represented by time detected parasitaemic, parasitaemia score and packed red cell volume percent (pcv) on reproductive performance, calf weaning weight and cow productivity. control of development of anaemia, measured by pcv value during trypanosome infection, had the major effect on all three performance traits. the repeatability of this criterion (0.33) was almost equal to that of calf weaning weight, indicating pcv measurement might be suitable for identification of more trypanotolerant animals. simultaneous evaluation of the relative effects of control of development of anaemia in both the pre-weaner calf and its dam, on calf performance, suggested that its measurement in an animal might be feasible at an early post-weaner stage. guidelines for work to develop practical field tests for trypanotolerance involving post-weaners maintained for varying lengths of time in high natural challenge situations are suggested.
background & aims concerns have been raised about potential neurological injury related to exogenous glutamate. in cardiac surgery glutamate has been administered as a putative cardioprotective agent by cardioplegia or intravenous infusion. in the glutamics trial, in addition to surveillance of clinical neurological injuries, a prespecified subgroup was analyzed with regard to postoperative s-100b levels to detect potential subclinical neurological injury related to glutamate infusion.   methods sixty-nine patients operated on for unstable coronary syndrome were randomized to intravenous infusion of glutamate (n=35) or saline (n=34) perioperatively. plasma levels of s-100b were obtained on the third postoperative day.   results s-100b in the glutamate group and the control group were 0.079+/-0.034microg/l and 0.090+/-0.042microg/l respectively (p=0.245). there were no patients with stroke or mortality. three patients in the control group and two in the glutamate group had postoperative confusion. these patients had significantly elevated s-100b compared with those without confusion (0.132+/-0.047vs 0.081+/-0.036microg/l; p=0.003). overall, 21 patients had s-100b above reference level (> or =0.10microg/l) and these patients had significantly more calcifications in the ascending aorta on epiaortic scanning.   conclusions intravenous glutamate infusion during surgery for unstable coronary artery disease did not initiate a sustained elevation of plasma s-100b. thus, no evidence for subclinical neurological injury related to glutamate infusion was found. in contrast, postoperative elevation of plasma s-100b was linked to calcification of the ascending aorta and postoperative confusion. the efficacy of myocardial protection with a single aortic crossclamp and blood cardioplegia was evaluated in 819 consecutive patients stratified for preoperative condition by means of a new clinical risk scoring system. a protocol using either antegrade or antegrade/retrograde blood cardioplegia was compared with antegrade crystalloid cardioplegia in 2582 similar, consecutive, and concurrent patients. in the blood cardioplegia cohort, 97 (11.8%) patients had 129 complications compared with 407 (15.8%) patients and 675 complications in the crystalloid cardioplegia group (p = 0.006). in high-risk patients, combined antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia significantly reduced myocardial infarction, stroke, and respiratory and wound complications. despite the significantly longer aortic crossclamp time required for blood cardioplegia, patients undergoing crystalloid cardioplegia were 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.3, 2.1) times more likely to have a morbid event. time in the intensive care unit, length of hospitalization, and length-of-stay outlier status were significantly decreased in the blood cardioplegia compared with the crystalloid cardioplegia group. the net savings in hospital cost amounted to $2196 per case. when compared separately with crystalloid cardioplegia, combined antegrade/retrograde blood cardioplegia accounted for most of the morbidity reduction by significantly reducing perioperative myocardial infarction, wound complications, and length of stay in patients having reoperations. antegrade/retrograde blood cardioplegia did not influence 1-year survival or event-free survival, even when risk was considered.
vertebrate olfactory sensory neurons are replaced continuously throughout life. we studied the effect of age on proliferation in olfactory epithelium in postnatal rats ranging in age from birth (p1) until p333. using brdu to label dividing cells, we determined the proliferation density of basal cells, i.e., the number of labeled nuclei/unit length (240 μm) of olfactory epithelium in coronal sections from six different anterior–posterior levels from each animal. a total length of >1 m of olfactory epithelium was counted in each age group. we observed a dramatic decrease of proliferation density from p1 through p333. at p1, proliferation density is 151 cells/mm; it decreases to approximately half at p21 (70 cells/mm), and half again at p40 (37 cells/mm). at p333 the proliferation density was only 8/mm, ∼5% of that seen at p1. the changes were clearly related to age and not to body weight, because the values were essentially identical for males and females of the same age but of different body weight. proliferating cells appear in patches that, after p40, become more separated from one another and contain fewer cells. in 6- and 11-month-old rats, 30 and 45% of all units contained no labeled cells. we confirmed the data of others that the olfactory surface area continuously increases with age; we showed that there is a reciprocal relationship between proliferation density and surface area. the proliferating cells provide neurons to sustain growth as well as to replace dying cells. the basal region in the developing olfactory epithelium of mice was investigated by double immunostaining using anti-keratin (ma903) and anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibodies. basal cells proper, which are ma903 positive, and globose basal cells, which are ma903 negative, were differentiated in the basal region on embryonic day 18 to postnatal day 1. at this stage, brdu-labeling was found more in the glubose basal cells than in the basal cells proper. the labeled globose basal cells increased in number and reached the maximum on postnatal day 3, and decreased in number on postnatal day 14. the labeled basal cells proper was concentrated near the border with the respiratory epithelium on postnatal day 1, but they were found in small numbers in other regions of olfactory epithelium during later stages of development. active division of globose basal cells accompanied the 1.5-fold increase in the thickness of the olfactory epithelium, which is caused by the increase in the number of olfactory cells, during development. it is suggested that during late embryonic and postnatal days olfactory cells originate from globose basal cells, not from basal cells proper. the division of basal cells proper may contribute to an 8-fold increase in the surface area of the olfactory epithelium during development.
the current study evaluates a tested marbofloxacin tablet (mbt) (petsen), in terms of bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (pk) in a comparison of the commercialized and standard tablet (marbocyl) in beagle dogs. four different bacterial species were selected for the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) against marbofloxacin (mbf). target animal safety studies were conducted with a wide spectrum of dosages of petsen. pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of petsen were observed after the oral administration of a recommended dosage of 2 mg/kg. the mic90 of mbf against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, and streptococcus were 2.00, 4.00, 0.25, and 0.50 μg/ml, respectively. these results showed that the mbt has an expected antimicrobial activity in vitro. the main parameters of t1/2β, clb, auc0−∞, cmax, and ke were 22.14 h, 0.15 l/h, 13.27 μg.h/ml, 0.95 μg/ml, 0.09 h−1, and 16.47 h, 0.14 l/h, 14.10 μg.h/ml, 0.97 μg/ml, 0.11 h−1 after the orally administrated petsen and marbocyl, while no biologically significant changes and toxicological significance have been found by their comparison. these findings indicate that the petsen had a slow elimination, high bioavailability and kinetically similar to the commercialized marbocyl. furthermore, no statistically significant differences were distinguished on the continuous gradient dosages of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg in the term of the clinical presentation. the present study results displayed that the tested mbt (petsen) was safe, with limited toxicity, which was similar to the commercialized tablet (marbocyl), could provide an alternative mbt as a veterinary medicine in beagle dogs. abstract 1. the aim of the present study was to determine the pks of marbofloxacin in beagle dogs after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration, the ex vivo and in vitro pk/pd indices of marbofloxacin against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, and the ex vivo auc/mic ratios associated with different levels of antibacterial activity. 2. after i.v. of marbofloxacin (2 mg/kg), the mean ± sem values of auc, t1/2β, vss, and cl were 8.47 ± 3.51 h µg/ml, 8.08 ± 6.25 h, 2.32 ± 1.00 l/kg and 0.23 ± 0.06 l/kg/h and corresponding values after intramuscular injection were 11.37 ± 3.07 h µg/ml, 7.51 ± 3.70, 1.80 ± 0.90 l/kg and 0.17 ± 0.04 l/kg/h. after i.m. administration, a cmax of 1.76 ± 0.09 µg/ml was achieved at tmax of 0.47 ± 0.08 h. the ex-vivo auc/mic ratios required to produce bacteriostasis, bactericidal action and elimination of s. pseudintermedius were 65.03, 97.02 and 136.84 h. 3. the in vivo auc/mic ratios obtained after i.v. and i.m. administration of 2 mg/kg marbofloxacin (67.76 ± 1.23 and 91.18 ± 2.61) were below the ex vivo auc/mic ratios required for bactericidal activity and bacterial elimination (97.02 ± 9.24 2 mg/kg and 136.21 ± 7.58), suggesting that the recommended daily dosage (2 mg/kg) may not suffice to kill and eradicate s. pseudintermedius strains encountered in clinical area.
cmer functions as a transcriptional repressor modulating the expression of the multidrug efflux pump cmeabc in campylobacter jejuni. to determine if cmer also regulates other genes in c. jejuni, we compared the transcriptome of the cmer mutant with that of the wild-type strain using a dna microarray. this comparison identified 28 genes that showed a > or = 2-fold change in expression in the cmer mutant. independent real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr experiments confirmed 27 of the 28 differentially expressed genes. the cmer-regulated genes encode membrane transporters, proteins involved in c4-dicarboxylate transport and utilization, enzymes for biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharide, and hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. among the genes whose expression was upregulated in the cmer mutant, cj0561c (encoding a putative periplasmic protein) showed the greatest increase in expression. subsequent experiments demonstrated that this gene is strongly repressed by cmer. the presence of the known cmer-binding site, an inverted repeat of tgtaat, in the promoter region of cj0561c suggests that cmer directly inhibits the transcription of cj0561c. similar to expression of cmeabc, transcription of cj0561c is strongly induced by bile compounds, which are normally present in the intestinal tracts of animals. inactivation of cj0561c did not affect the susceptibility of c. jejuni to antimicrobial compounds in vitro but reduced the fitness of c. jejuni in chickens. loss-of-function mutation of cmer severely reduced the ability of c. jejuni to colonize chickens. together, these findings indicate that cmer governs the expression of multiple genes with diverse functions and is required for campylobacter adaptation in the chicken host. the cmeabc multidrug efflux pump, which belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division (rnd) family, recognizes and extrudes a broad range of antimicrobial agents and is essential for campylobacter jejuni colonization of the animal intestinal tract by mediating the efflux of bile acids. the expression of cmeabc is controlled by the transcriptional regulator cmer, whose open reading frame is located immediately upstream of the cmeabc operon. to understand the structural basis of cmer regulation, we have determined the crystal structure of cmer to 2.2 a resolution, revealing a dimeric two-domain molecule with an entirely helical architecture similar to members of the tetr family of transcriptional regulators. unlike the rest of the tetr regulators, cmer has a large center-to-center distance (54 a) between two n termini of the dimer, and a large flexible ligand-binding pocket in the c-terminal domain. each monomer forms a 20 a long tunnel-like cavity in the ligand-binding domain of cmer and is occupied by a fortuitous ligand that is identified as glycerol. the binding of glycerol to cmer induces a conformational state that is incompatible with target dna. as glycerol has a chemical structure similar to that of potential ligands of cmer, the structure obtained mimics the induced form of cmer. these findings reveal novel structural features of a tetr family regulator, and provide new insight into the mechanisms of ligand binding and cmer regulation.
microalgae can synthesize and accumulate lipid upon abiotic stresses such as high light (hl) and nitrogen deficiency (nd). in this work, hl and nd were applied to the oleaginous alga nannochloropsis salina, individually or in combination, in order to investigate the transcriptional regulation on lipid metabolism. an impaired cell growth was observed under all three stress conditions, with hl + nd leading to the lowest biomass concentration. hl + nd gave rise to the greatest total lipid content (46.5% dry weight), 64% higher than the control. by contrast, the highest lipid productivity was achieved under hl condition. transcriptional analyses using quantitative real-time pcr suggested that the augmented accumulation of lipids including triacylglycerol (tag) upon stresses correlated with the upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, malic enzyme, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, acetyl-coa carboxylase (accase), and fatty acid elongase. the presence of quizalofop, an inhibitor of accase, caused a considerable decline in tag accumulation, yet having little effect on membrane lipids. possible carbon metabolic pathways related to tag biosynthesis are proposed. our results facilitate the understanding of tag accumulation and its transcriptional regulation and provide implications into future genetic engineering for improving lipid production by n. salina. the role of diatoms as a source of bioactive compounds has been recently explored. diatom cells store a high amount of fatty acids, especially certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas). however, many aspects of diatom metabolism and the production of pufas remain unclear. this review describes a number of technical strategies, such as modulation of environmental factors (temperature, light, chemical composition of culture medium) and culture methods, to influence the content of pufas in diatoms. genetic engineering, a newly emerging field, also plays an important role in controlling the synthesis of fatty acids in marine microalgae. several key points in the biosynthetic pathway of pufas in diatoms as well as recent progresses are also a critical part and are summarized here.
hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the absence of enteric ganglia in the distal intestinal tract. while classified as a multigenic disorder, the altered function of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor is responsible for the majority of the pathogenesis of hscr. recent evidence demonstrate a strong association between ret and the homeostasis of immune system. here, we utilize a unique cohort of fifty hscr patients to fully characterize the expression of ret receptor on both innate (monocytes and natural killer lymphocytes) and adaptive (b and t lymphocytes) human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and to explore the role of ret signaling in the immune system. we show that the increased expression of ret receptor on immune cell subsets from hscr individuals correlates with the presence of loss-of-function ret mutations. moreover, we demonstrate that the engagement of ret on pbmcs induces the modulation of several inflammatory genes. in particular, ret stimulation with glial-cell line derived neurotrophic factor family (gdnf) and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchored co-receptor α1 (gfrα1) trigger the up-modulation of genes encoding either for chemokines (ccl20, ccl2, ccl3, ccl4, ccl7, cxcl1) and cytokines (il-1β, il-6 and il-8) and the down-regulation of chemokine/cytokine receptors (ccr2 and il8-rα). although at different levels, the modulation of these “ret-dependent genes” occurs in both healthy donors and hscr patients. we also describe another set of genes that, independently from ret stimulation, are differently regulated in healthy donors versus hscr patients. among these “ret-independent genes”, there are csf-1r, il1-r1, il1-r2 and tgfβ-1, whose levels of transcripts were lower in hscr patients compared to healthy donors, thus suggesting aberrancies of inflammatory responses at mucosal level. overall our results demonstrate that immune system actively participates in the physiopathology of hscr disease by modulating inflammatory programs that are either dependent or independent from ret signaling. there is increasing evidence that factors originally identified due to their neurotrophic activity also function within the immune system. this study focused on the related molecules glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) and neurturin (ntn) as well as their receptors. gdnf and ntn signaling is mediated by a two-component receptor: a signal-transducing component, ret, which is shared by both ligands, and a ligand-specific binding component, gfrα-1 (higher gdnf affinity) or gfrα-2 (higher ntn affinity). we report that human t cells, b cells, and monocytes produce ntn but not gdnf, as seen by rt-pcr and immunocytochemistry. ret was expressed by b cells, t cells, and monocytes. exons 2–5 of ret encoding the cadherin-like domains 1–3 in the extracellular part and exons 16–19 encoding a section of the second tyrosine kinase domain were transcribed in cd4+ t cells, cd8+ t cells, b cells, and monocytes. different splice variants encoding the c-terminal intracellular part (exons 19–21) of ret were detected. the ligand-binding receptors gfrα-1 and gfrα-2 were transcribed in all immune cell subsets. quantitative pcr showed that gfrα-2 is by far the dominant ligand binding chain in t cells, b cells, and monocytes. addition of gdnf or ntn to activated pbmcs reduced the amount of detectable tnf protein without altering its transcription. together, this suggests that immune cells communicate with each other via ntn. production of ntn by immune cells might also contribute to the neuroprotective immunity in the cns observed in different model systems.
backgroundpolycystic kidney disease (pkd) kidneys exhibit increased extracellular matrix (ecm) collagen expression and metalloproteinases (mmps) activity. we investigated the role of these increases on cystic disease progression in pkd kidneys.methodswe examined the role of type i collagen (collagen i) and membrane bound type 1 mmp (mt1-mmp) on cyst development using both in vitro 3 dimensional (3d) collagen gel culture and in vivo pck rat model of pkd.resultswe found that collagen concentration is critical in controlling the morphogenesis of mdck cells cultured in 3d gels. mdck cells did not form 3d structures at collagen i concentrations lower than 1 mg/ml but began forming tubules when the concentration reaches 1 mg/ml. significantly, these cells began to form cyst when collagen i concentration reached to 1.2 mg/ml, and the ratios of cyst to tubule structures increased as the collagen i concentration increased. these cells exclusively formed cyst structures at a collagen i concentration of 1.8 mg/ml or higher. overexpression of mt1-mmp in mdck cells significantly induced cyst growth in 3d collagen gel culture. conversely, inhibition of mmps activity with doxycycline, a fda approved pan-mmps inhibitor, dramatically slowed cyst growth. more importantly, the treatment of pck rats with doxycycline significantly decreased renal tubule cell proliferation and markedly inhibited the cystic disease progression.conclusionsour data suggest that increased collagen expression and mmp activity in pkd kidneys may induce cyst formation and expansion. our findings also suggest that mmps may serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of human pkd. background the appearance of interstitial fibrosis in polycystic kidneys is emblematic of progressive disease. matrix forming this scar tissue is derived from local renal cells in response to cystogenesis. we investigated the phenotype of collagen-producing cells in the cystic kidneys of dba/2-pcy mice to better characterize the spectrum of interstitial cells associated with renal fibrogenesis.   methods the extent of interstitial fibrosis and the number of fibroblasts in cystic kidneys were first quantitated over time using computer-assisted image analysis. subsequently, antisera to four cell protein markers were studied by coexpression immunohistochemistry during progression of fibrosis using confocal microscopy. the antisera included fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1) for fibroblast phenotype, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) for contractile phenotype, vimentin (vim) for mesenchymal phenotype, and heat shock protein 47 (hsp47) for interstitial collagen-producing phenotype.   results interstitial fibrosis in cystic kidneys gradually increased throughout the 30-week observation period of our study. with progression of cystogenesis, most of the tubules in pcy mice either dilated or disappeared with time. fsp1+ fibroblasts were distributed sparsely throughout the renal interstitium of young pcy and wild-type mice. their number increased in the widening fibrotic septa by 18 weeks of age and persisted through 30 weeks of the study interval. some epithelia among remnant tubules trapped within fibrotic septa around adjacent cysts also acquired the phenotype of fsp1+, hsp47+ collagen-producing fibroblasts, suggesting a possible role for epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (emt) in this process. most fsp1+ fibroblasts were alpha-sma-, but hsp47+, suggesting they were producing collagen proteins for the extracellular matrix. alpha-sma+, fsp1-, hsp47+ or hsp47- cells were also observed, and the latter tended to distribute independently in a linear pattern, reminiscent of vasculature adjacent to forming cysts. vim+ expression was not observed in alpha-sma+ cells.   conclusions many nonoverlapping as well as fewer overlapping populations of fsp1+ and alpha-sma+ cells shared in the collagen expression associated with progressive fibrogenesis in pcy mice undergoing cystogenesis. some fsp1+ fibroblasts are likely derived from tubular epithelium undergoing emt, while alphasma+, vim- cells probably represent vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes surviving vessel attenuation during the chaos of fibrogenesis. importantly, not all interstitial cells producing collagens are alpha-sma+.
aims/hypothesisthe aim of this study was to examine whether genetic variation in adipoq, adipor1 and adipor2 may contribute to increased susceptibility to components of the insulin resistance syndrome (irs).materials and methodswe genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in adipoq, adipor1 and adipor2 in mexican american subjects (n=439) and performed an association analysis of irs-related traits.resultsof the eight snps examined in the adipoq gene, rs4632532 and rs182052 exhibited significant associations with bmi (p=0.029 and p=0.032), fasting specific insulin (p=0.023 and p=0.026), sum of skin folds (ss) (p=0.0089 and p=0.0084) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity (homa-%s) (p=0.015 and p=0.016). two other snps, rs266729 and rs2241767, were significantly associated with ss (p=0.036 and p=0.013). snp rs7539542 of adipor1 was significantly associated with bmi, ss and waist circumference (p=0.025, p=0.047 and p=0.0062). fourteen of the adipor2 snps were found to be significantly (p<0.05) associated with fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations. four of these snps (rs10848569, rs929434, rs3809266 and rs12342) were in high pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2=0.99) and were strongly associated with fasting triglyceride levels (p=0.00029, p=0.00016, p=0.00027 and p=0.00021). adjusting for the effects of bmi and homa-%s on triglyceride concentrations increased significance to p=0.000060 for snp rs929434. bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide analysis was used to examine all possible models of gene action. again, snp rs929434 provided the strongest statistical evidence of an effect on triglyceride concentrations.conclusions/interpretationthese results provide evidence for association of snps in adipoq and its receptors with multiple irs-related phenotypes. specifically, several genetic variants in adipor2 were strongly associated with decreased triglyceride levels. the adiponectin receptors, adipor1 and adipor2, are thought to transmit the insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and atheroprotective effects of adiponectin. in this study, we examined whether adipor mrna expression in human myotubes correlates with in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity. myotubes from 40 metabolically characterized donors expressed 1.8-fold more adipor1 than adipor2 mrna (588 +/- 35 vs. 321 +/- 39 fg/microg total rna). moreover, the expression levels of both receptors correlated with each other (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). adipor1 mrna expression was positively correlated with in vivo insulin and c-peptide concentrations, first-phase insulin secretion, and plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations before and after adjustment for sex, age, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat. expression of adipor2 mrna clearly associated only with plasma triglyceride concentrations. in multivariate linear regression models, mrna expression of adipor1, but not adipor2, was a determinant of first-phase insulin secretion independent of insulin sensitivity and body fat. finally, insulin did not directly modify myotube adipor1 mrna expression in vitro. in conclusion, we provide evidence that myotube mrna levels of both receptors are associated with distinct metabolic functions but not with insulin sensitivity. adipor1, but not adipor2, expression correlated with insulin secretion. the molecular nature of this link between muscle and beta-cells needs to be further clarified.
we analyze the squeezing and entanglement properties of the two-mode light produced by a composite system consists of a nondegenerate three-level laser and a parametric amplifier employing the pertinent master equation. it so turns out that the two-mode light is in a highly squeezed and entangled state. we consider a two-photon correlated emission laser as a source of an entangled radiation with a large number of photons in each mode. the system consists of three-level atomic schemes inside a doubly resonant cavity. we study the dynamics of this system in the presence of cavity losses, concluding that the creation of entangled states with photon numbers up to tens of thousands seems achievable.
backgroundunited states army combat engineer (eng) training is an intense 14-week course designed to introduce new recruits to basic soldiering activities, army values and lifestyle, and engineering skills and knowledge. the present investigation examined injury rates and injury risk factors in eng training.methodsat the start of their training, 1,633 male eng recruits were administered a questionnaire containing items on date of birth, height, weight, tobacco use, prior physical activity, and injury history. injuries during training were obtained from electronic medical records and the training units provided data on student graduation and attrition. risk factors were identified using cox regression.resultsninety-two percent of the recruits successfully graduated from the course and 47% of the recruits experienced one or more injuries during training. univariate cox regression demonstrated that recruits were at higher injury risk if they reported that they were older, had a higher or lower body mass index, had smoked in the past, had performed less exercise (aerobic or muscle strength) or sports prior to eng training, had experienced a previous time-loss lower limb injury (especially if they had not totally recovered from that injury), or had a lower educational level.conclusionsthe present investigation was the first to identify injury rates and identify specific factors increasing injury risk during eng training. the identified risk factors provide a basis for recommending future prevention strategies. the rate of injuries resulting from physical exercise in sport centers as well as related factors has not yet been described. the aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of self‐reported activity‐specific injuries, to identify the relations between injury profile and different types and patterns of physical activity and to assess whether gender is a modifying variable in that connection. four hundred and fifty‐seven men and women aged 20–35 years participated in this cross‐sectional study. a questionnaire was used to evaluate the types and patterns of physical activity performed in the 12 months preceding the study and sports injuries sustained during that time. one hundred and ninety of the 457 subjects reported an injury as a result of exercising (41.6%). a relationship was found between weight training and injuries of the upper extremity (ue) for men and between spinning classes and knee injuries for women. among those who participated in weight‐training exercises, more frequent and longer duration exercise was associated with ue injury, and among those who participated in spinning classes more frequent exercise was associated with knee injury. future injury prevention programs in sport centers should pay special attention to men who participate in weight training and to women who participate in spinning classes.
low levels of human papillomavirus (hpv) awareness and knowledge have been observed in the few studies conducted among school-going adolescents. such data are lacking in germany. to assess awareness of hpv and of vaccination status among girls attending grades 8–13 in bremen and bremerhaven, two german cities. participants completed a questionnaire in school including questions on demographic characteristics, about hpv awareness and on vaccination status. we analysed the relationship between awareness of hpv, of vaccination status and vaccine uptake and several variables including age and migrant background using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. six hundred and thirty-two girls aged 12–20 years completed the questionnaire. 50 % had no awareness of hpv, 12 % reported being vaccinated against hpv and 57 % did not know whether or not they were vaccinated against hpv. in multivariate analyses, ever had sex was associated with awareness of hpv, and ever been to a gynaecologist with awareness of vaccination status. our results may be an indication that female adolescents in germany are not adequately informed and counselled about hpv and associated issues. the aim of the study was to investigate knowledge of and attitudes to sexually transmitted infection (sti) and sti prevention with special focus on human papillomavirus (hpv) and the new vaccine against hpv, among 16-year-old high school students in a swedish context. a study-specific questionnaire was distributed to 572 first year high school students from five different high schools in a medium-sized town in sweden. the students lacked knowledge of hpv and its association with cervical cancer. similarly, their knowledge of the new vaccine was limited. their attitude to condom use when having sex with a new partner was positive, but decreased if oral contraceptives were used and if they were vaccinated against an sti. the main source of information was the school, followed by youth clinics and the media. the results highlight the clinical importance for school nurses and personnel at youth clinics to inform adolescents about hpv and its association with cancer.
impaired temporal control is symptomatic of several neurological disorders; recently, it has been implicated in schizophrenia. an animal model of schizophrenia using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) infused to the medial pre-frontal cortex (mpfc) was employed to examine its effects on temporal control. twelve rats were trained on a peak-interval procedure (pip) until stable patterns of behavior were obtained. rats infused with 6-ohda responded less during peak trials and their peak functions were flatter than sham rats. these results are consistent with similar studies with transgenic mice with increased striatal dopamine d2 receptor activity. lesions in the mpfc decreased motivation to respond in a pip. these effects may be considered analogous to negative symptoms of schizophrenia. highlights ► the effect of timing behaviour on cortical and striatal fos expression was examined. ► rats trained on the peak procedure (fipp) and a control schedule were compared. ► fos expression in the orbital pfc was enhanced following exposure to the fipp. ► fos expression in the striatum did not differ between rats trained on the two tasks. ► the results suggest that the orbital pfc is involved in interval timing behaviour.
unhealthy eating during adolescence has shown to have multiple negative consequences. the aim of this paper is to acquire knowledge of dietary habits in adolescence and consider how this behaviour varies across different groups of adolescents. correlations between dietary habits, age and gender have several times been found, in terms of girls eating healthier than boys, and the intake of healthy food decreasing with age. additionally, adolescents of low socioeconomic position are at higher risk for having unhealthy dietary habits, while adolescents who are physically active seem to eat healthier. further, it has been shown that low self-esteem in adolescence is associated with eating disorders, representing both restrained eating, but also binge eating. the mentioned correlations can be understood and explained using individual psychological models of health behaviour, like the kap model and social cognitive theory. objective: to examine the dietary and activity correlates of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by children in middle and high school. methods: data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 15 283 children in middle and high schools in texas. consumption of sodas and noncarbonated flavored and sports beverages (fsbs) were examined separately for their associations with the level of (1) unhealthy food (fried meats, french fries, desserts) consumption, (2) healthy food (vegetables, fruit, and milk) consumption, (3) physical activity including usual vigorous physical activity and participation in organized physical activity, and (4) sedentary activity, including hours spent watching television, using the computer, and playing video games. results: for both genders, consumption of soda and fsbs was systematically associated with a number of unhealthy dietary practices and with sedentary behaviors. however, consumption of fsbs showed significant positive graded associations with several healthy dietary practices and level of physical activity, whereas soda consumption showed no such associations with healthy behaviors. conclusions: consumption of fsbs coexists with healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors, which suggests popular misperception of these beverages as being consistent with a healthy lifestyle. assessment and obesity-prevention efforts that target sugar-sweetened beverages need to distinguish between fsbs and sodas.
recognition memory was assessed by submitting the same adult monkeys to visual paired comparison (vpc) with mixed delays (10-120 sec), followed by three consecutive versions of object-delayed nonmatching-to-sample (dnms): increasing delays (10-600 sec), lengthened lists (3-10 objects), and intervening distractors in the delays (light at 10 sec, motor task at 30-600 sec, or context change at 600 sec). four groups were tested: normal controls, monkeys with ibotenic acid lesions of the hippocampal formation (h), and monkeys with aspiration lesions of either the perirhinal (prh) or parahippocampal (areas th/tf) cortex. group h was impaired on vpc at delays ≥60 sec but had difficulty on dnms only at 600 sec delays with distraction. in group th/tf, the vpc impairment emerged earlier (30 sec); yet, once the nonmatching rule was mastered, no significant change occurred on any dnms condition. only group prh behaved congruently on vpc and dnms, exhibiting a deficit at the easiest condition that worsened with increasing delays as well as in dnms lengthened list and distraction conditions. these results led us to postulate that vpc and dnms, as previously administered to monkeys, were not equivalent visual recognition memory probes. specifically, we propose that, for vpc, because of passive (incidental) encoding, the animal's performance rests on both item familiarity and event recollection, whereas, for dnms, because of active (purposeful) encoding, performance relies more on item familiarity. this proposal converges with current models postulating distinct, but interactive, mnemonic roles for the hippocampal and adjacent th/tf regions. monkeys in whom the fornix had been transected and controls were trained on two versions of delayed non-matching to sample (dnms). on dnms-lss the stimulus pair for each trial was selected from a large set of junk objects so that the animals saw particular stimuli infrequently. on dnms-rs the same two stimuli were presented repeatedly. memory for the sample was assessed with retention intervals of 10, 70 and 130 sec spent either in the dark or with levels of illumination designed to promote interference effects. on dnms-lss the lesioned animals were impaired, being more susceptible than controls to increases in the retention interval. however, neither group was particularly sensitive to interference. in contrast, on dnms-rs the lesioned monkeys were unimpaired, both groups showing a marked decrement in performance with increasing retention interval and a high sensitivity to the effects of interference. these data suggest that monkeys possess a short-term memory which is intact after transection of the fornix and a long-term memory which is not.
introduction: the aim of our study was to investigate whether a pleasant tactile stimulation which is manually produced is qualitatively comparable to an analogous tactile stimulation produced instead by a mechanical source. methods: thirty-one subjects [16 men, 15 women, 24.5 ± 2.6 years, mean, and standard deviation (sd)] were tested under four different conditions in a repeated measurements design. a pleasant caress-like brush stroke on the hairy skin of the forearm was either produced by a robot or by hand with three different velocities (0.3, 3, and 30 cm/s). in two conditions the subjects were informed about the stroke's source, whereas in two different conditions they were not. subsequent to the stimulation, the subjects were asked to rate both pleasantness and intensity of each tactile sensation. results: consistently, pleasantness ratings were very similar in both conditions. this was found across stimulus velocities and regardless of whether the subjects were informed about the source of the on-going stroke or not. in contrast, intensity ratings were significantly higher in the handheld condition for the two slower velocities, but not for the fastest one. conclusion: as robot and human touch are highly comparable in terms of perceived pleasantness, handheld stimulation may be used in studies of touch hedonia where robot stimulation is not applicable (for instance in children or certain body parts). we show that the affective experience of touch and the sight of touch can be modulated by cognition, and investigate in an fmri study where top-down cognitive modulations of bottom-up somatosensory and visual processing of touch and its affective value occur in the human brain. the cognitive modulation was produced by word labels, 'rich moisturizing cream' or 'basic cream', while cream was being applied to the forearm, or was seen being applied to a forearm. the subjective pleasantness and richness were modulated by the word labels, as were the fmri activations to touch in parietal cortex area 7, the insula and ventral striatum. the cognitive labels influenced the activations to the sight of touch and also the correlations with pleasantness in the pregenual cingulate/orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum. further evidence of how the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in affective aspects of touch was that touch to the forearm [which has c fiber touch (ct) afferents sensitive to light touch] compared with touch to the glabrous skin of the hand (which does not) revealed activation in the mid-orbitofrontal cortex. this is of interest as previous studies have suggested that the ct system is important in affiliative caress-like touch between individuals.
nonlinear dynamical systems abound as models of natural phenomena. they are often characterized by highly unpredictable behaviour which is hard to analyze as it occurs, for example, in chaotic systems. a basic problem is to understand what kind of information we can realistically expect to extract from those systems, especially information concerning their long-term evolution. here we review a few recent results which look at this problem from a computational perspective. in this paper we consider the computability of the solution of the initial- value problem for differential equations and for differential inclusions with semicontin- uous right-hand side. we present algorithms for the computation of the solution using the "ten thousand monkeys" approach, in which we generate all possible solution tubes, and then check which are valid. in this way, we show that the solution of a locally lip- schitz differential equation is computable even if the function is not effectively locally lipschitz, and recover a result of ruohonen, in which it is shown that if the solution is unique, then it is computable. we give an example of a computable locally lipschitz function which is not effectively locally lipschitz. we also show that the solutions of a convex-valued upper-semicontinuous differential inclusion are upper-semicomputable, and the solutions of a lower-semicontinuous one-sided lipschitz differential inclusion are lower-semicomputable.
background to investigate the possibility if alexithymia could be used as a predictor of attempted suicide among patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.   subjects and methods the study was based on 127 veterans from the 1991-1995 war in croatia. all the patients involved in this study were previously diagnosed with ptsd. the questionnaires (socio-demographic questionnaire, mississippi scale for combat related ptsd questionnaire, and 20-item toronto alexithymia scale questionnaire) were administered by investigators.   results the results suggest that alexithymia was significantly associated with attempted suicide (p=0.020). furthermore, alexithymia remained a significant predictor of an attempted suicide even in the multivariate regression model, which yielded an odds ratio (or) of 2.87 (95% confidence intervals 1.18-7.00).   conclusions these results point out that alexithymia can be considered as a potential risk factor for suicide in this population, suggesting that it may also be used as an indicator of worsening psychological status and attempted suicide in other population groups with higher alexithymia prevalence. alexithymic features are often associated with depression, which is the most important risk factor for suicidal behaviors. nevertheless, little is known about the associations between alexithymia and suicidality. in this 12-month follow-up study we investigated the relationship between alexithymia and suicidal ideation in a sample of the general population (n = 1,563) using the 20-item toronto alexithymia scale (tas-20) and the 21-item beck depression inventory (bdi). suicidal ideation was more common among subjects with alexithymia than among nonalexithymic subjects (32% v 9% at baseline and 36% v 9% after 12 months). in cross-sectional analyses, alexithymia associated with the presence of suicidal ideation even after adjustment for sex, age, and several psychosocial and socioeconomic factors and the presence of depression. moreover, after adjustment for depression at baseline, the decrease and increase in alexithymic features during the study period associated independently with recovery from and the occurrence of suicidal ideation, respectively. nevertheless, these associations were no longer independent when adjusted for concomitant changes in the level of depressive symptoms. in conclusion, if depression presents alexithymic features the subject has an additive impact on the risk of suicidal ideation.
the mediterranean diet is a healthy dietary pattern known to actively modulate the cell membrane properties. phase angle (pha) is a direct measure by bioelectrical impedance analysis (bia) used as marker of cell membrane integrity. both food behaviour and pha are influenced by age, sex and body weight. the aim of this study was to cross-sectionally evaluate the association between the adherence to mediterranean diet and pha in 1013 healthy adult patients stratified according to sex, age, and body mass index (bmi). the adherence to the mediterranean diet was evaluated using the prevención con dieta mediterránea (predimed) questionnaire. pha was calculated by bia phase-sensitive system (50 khz bia 101 rjl, akern bioresearch, florence, italy akern). in both sexes, at roc analysis a predimed score ≥ 6 predicted a pha beyond the median value. at the multivariate analysis, among predimed score, age, and bmi, the predimed score was the major determinant of pha, explaining 44.5% and 47.3% of pha variability, in males and females respectively (p < 0.001). a novel association was reported between the adherence to the mediterranean diet and pha, independently of sex, age, and body weight. this association uncovered a new potential benefit of the mediterranean diet on health outcomes, as in both sexes higher adherence to the mediterranean diet was associated to larger phas, as expression of cell membrane integrity. objective independently of total caloric intake, a better quality of the diet (for example, conformity to the mediterranean diet) is associated with lower obesity risk. it is unclear whether a brief dietary assessment tool, instead of full-length comprehensive methods, can also capture this association. in addition to reduced costs, a brief tool has the interesting advantage of allowing immediate feedback to participants in interventional studies. another relevant question is which individual items of such a brief tool are responsible for this association. we examined these associations using a 14-item tool of adherence to the mediterranean diet as exposure and body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (whtr) as outcomes. design cross-sectional assessment of all participants in the “prevención con dieta mediterránea” (predimed) trial. subjects 7,447 participants (55–80 years, 57% women) free of cardiovascular disease, but with either type 2 diabetes or ≥3 cardiovascular risk factors. trained dietitians used both a validated 14-item questionnaire and a full-length validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary habits. trained nurses measured weight, height and waist circumference. results strong inverse linear associations between the 14-item tool and all adiposity indexes were found. for a two-point increment in the 14-item score, the multivariable-adjusted differences in whtr were −0.0066 (95% confidence interval, –0.0088 to −0.0049) for women and –0.0059 (–0.0079 to –0.0038) for men. the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for a whtr>0.6 in participants scoring ≥10 points versus ≤7 points was 0.68 (0.57 to 0.80) for women and 0.66 (0.54 to 0.80) for men. high consumption of nuts and low consumption of sweetened/carbonated beverages presented the strongest inverse associations with abdominal obesity. conclusions a brief 14-item tool was able to capture a strong monotonic inverse association between adherence to a good quality dietary pattern (mediterranean diet) and obesity indexes in a population of adults at high cardiovascular risk.
identifying the specific substrates of memory deficits in early alzheimer's disease would help to develop clinically-relevant therapies. the present study assesses the relationships between encoding versus retrieval deficits in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amci) and atrophy specifically within the hippocampus and throughout the white matter. twenty-two amci patients underwent t1-weighted mri scans and neuropsychological testing. grey matter and white matter segments obtained from the mri images were each entered in correlation analyses, assessed only in the hippocampus for grey matter segments, with encoding and retrieval memory performances. for the grey matter segments, the resulting spmt correlation maps were then superimposed onto a 3d surface view of the hippocampus to identify the relative involvement of the different subfields, a method already used and validated elsewhere. memory encoding deficits specifically correlated with ca1 subfield atrophy, while no relationship was found with white matter atrophy. in contrast, retrieval deficits were weakly related to hippocampal atrophy and did not involve a particular subfield, while they strongly correlated with loss of white matter, specifically in medial parietal and frontal areas. in amci patients, encoding impairment appears specifically related to atrophy of the ca1 hippocampal subfield, consistent with the predominance of encoding deficits and ca1 atrophy in amci. in contrast, episodic retrieval deficits seem to be underlain by more distributed tissue losses, consistent with a disruption of a hippocampo-parieto-frontal network. a meta‐analysis of experimentally induced changes in blood flow (“activations”) in positron emission tomography (pet) studies of memory has revealed an orderly functional anatomic pattern: activations in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding are located primarily in the rostral portions of the region, whereas activations associated with episodic memory retrieval are located primarily in the caudal portions. these findings are based on an analysis of a sample of 54 “hippocampal encoding and retrieval” activations that were culled from an overall database consisting of 52 published pet studies of memory. we refer to this general pattern of rostrocaudal gradient of encoding and retrieval pet activations as the hiper (hippocampal encoding/retrieval) model. the model suggests a division of memory‐related labor between the rostral and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation. because functional anatomic pattern of encoding and retrieval activation that defines the hiper model was unprecedented and unexpected, it is difficult to relate the model to what is already known or thought about functional neuroanatomy of episodic memory in the hippocampal regions. the model is interesting primarily because its exploration may yield fresh insights into the neural basis of human memory. hippocampus 1998;8:313–322. © 1998 wiley‐liss, inc.
background the 13c-caffeine breath test (cbt) is a non-invasive, quantitative test of liver function which has been shown to correlate inversely to the child-pugh score. the aim of the study was to determine the utility of cbt in the assessment of cirrhosis and its correlation to the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score. methods thirty-nine patients, 29 with cirrhosis and 10 with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis, and 8 healthy volunteers were included. cirrhotic patients were graded according to child-pugh and meld scores. all participants underwent cbt and laboratory tests on the same day. the results of the cbt were expressed as percentages of changes over baseline values (δ‰) per 100 mg caffeine. results the mean single 15-min, 30-min, 45-min and 1-h cbt results, as well as cumulative cbt values differed significantly between healthy controls or chronic liver disease patients and cirrhotics (1-h cbt: 3.22±1.06 or 3.56±2.80 vs. 1.69±2.52, p≤0.01). in contrast, the cbt results at any time point or cumulative values did not correlate with meld or child-pugh scores. receiver operating characteristics (roc) analysis showed that the 30-min cbt values were more accurate in differentiating cirrhotics from chronic liver disease patients (area under roc curve: 0.871). conclusions cbt can reliably differentiate the patients with decompensated cirrhosis from non-cirrhotic patients with chronic liver diseases. however, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, cbt results do not seem to be associated with the child-pugh and meld scores. the properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. the aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (cbt) using orally administered 13c‐caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. the cbt was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis b or c; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the cbt in a cohort of these subjects. over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the cbt exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, p < .001). cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced cbt values (1.15 ± 0.75 δ‰ mg−1) compared with controls (2.23 ± 0.76; p = .001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 ± 1.05; p = .04). there was a significant inverse relationship between the cbt and child‐pugh score (r = −.74, p = .002). the intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated cbts in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. although smoking was associated with an 86% to 141% increase in cbt in all groups, the cbt was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 ± 0.82, 3.63 ± 1.21, and 2.14 ± 1.14, respectively, p = .001). multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (p < .001) and disease state (p = .001) were significant predictors of the cbt. in conclusion, the 13c‐cbt represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.
during polychemotherapy, cytotoxic drugs are given in combinations to enhance their anti-tumor effectiveness. for most drug combinations, underlying signaling mechanisms responsible for positive drug–drug interactions remain elusive. here, we prove a decisive role for the bcl-2 family member noxa to mediate cell death by certain drug combinations, even if drugs were combined which acted independently from noxa, when given alone. in proof-of-principle studies, betulinic acid, doxorubicin and vincristine induced cell death in a p53- and noxa-independent pathway involving mitochondrial pore formation, release of cytochrome c and caspase activation. in contrast, when betulinic acid was combined with either doxorubicine or vincristine, cell death signaling changed considerably; the drug combinations clearly depended on both p53 and noxa. similarly and of high clinical relevance, in patient-derived childhood acute leukemia samples the drug combinations, but not the single drugs depended on p53 and noxa, as shown by rna interference studies in patient-derived cells. our data emphasize that noxa represents an important target molecule for combinations of drugs that alone do not target noxa. noxa might have a special role in regulating apoptosis sensitivity in the complex interplay of polychemotherapy. deciphering the differences in signaling of single drugs and drug combinations might enable designing highly effective novel polychemotherapy regimens. cancer cells survive despite violating rules of normal cellular behaviour that ordinarily provoke apoptosis. the blocks in apoptosis that keep cancer cells alive are therefore attractive candidates for targeted therapies. recent studies have significantly increased our understanding of how interactions among proteins in the bcl2 family determine cell survival or death. it is now possible to systematically determine how individual cancers escape apoptosis. such a determination can help predict not only whether cells are likely to be killed by antagonism of bcl2, but also whether they are likely to be sensitive to chemotherapy that kills by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
the complex and dynamic pattern of hoxb3 expression in the developing hindbrain and the associated neural crest of mouse embryos is controlled by three separate cis-regulatory elements: element i (region a), element iiia, and the r5 enhancer (element iva). we have examined the cis-regulatory element iiia by transgenic and mutational analysis to determine the upstream trans-acting factors and mechanisms that are involved in controlling the expression of the mouse hoxb3 gene in the anterior spinal cord and hindbrain up to the r5/r6 boundary, as well as the associated neural crest which migrate to the third and posterior branchial arches and to the gut. by deletion analysis, we have identified the sequence requirements within a 482-bp element iii482. two hox binding sites are identified in element iii482 and we have shown that in vitro both hoxb3 and hoxb4 proteins can interact with these hox binding sites, suggesting that auto/cross-regulation is required for establishing the expression of hoxb3 in the neural tube domain. interestingly, we have identified a novel gccaggc sequence motif within element iii482, which is also required to direct gene expression to a subset of the expression domains except for rhombomere 6 and the associated neural crest migrating to the third and posterior branchial arches. element iii482 can direct a higher level of reporter gene expression in r6, which led us to investigate whether kreisler is involved in regulating hoxb3 expression in r6 through this element. however, our transgenic and mutational analysis has demonstrated that, although kreisler binding sites are present, they are not required for the establishment or maintenance of reporter gene expression in r6. our results have provided evidence that the expression of hoxb3 in the neural tube up to the r5/r6 boundary is auto/cross-regulated by hox genes and expression of hoxb3 in r6 does not require kreisler. the mouse kreisler gene is expressed in rhombomeres (r) 5 and 6 during neural development and kreisler mutants have patterning defects in the hindbrain that are not fully understood. here we analyzed this phenotype with a combination of genetic, molecular, and cellular marking techniques. using hox/lacz transgenic mice as reporter lines and by analyzing eph/ephrin expression, we have found that while r5 fails to form in these mice, r6 is present. this shows that kreisler has an early role in the formation of r5. we also observed patterning defects in r3 and r4 that are outside the normal domain of kreisler expression. in both heterozygous and homozygous kreisler embryos some r5 markers are induced in r3, suggesting that there is a partial change in r3 identity that is not dependent upon the loss of r5. to investigate the cellular character of r6 in kreisler embryos we performed heterotopic grafting experiments in the mouse hindbrain to monitor its mixing properties. control experiments revealed that cells from even- or odd-numbered segments only mixed freely with themselves, but not with cells of opposite character. transposition of cells from the r6 territory of kreisler mutants reveals that they adopt mature r6 characteristics, as they freely mix only with cells from even-numbered rhombomeres. analysis of phox2b expression shows that some aspects of later neurogenesis in r6 are altered, which may be associated with the additional roles of kreisler in regulating segmental identity. together these results suggest that the formation of r6 has not been affected in kreisler mutants. this analysis has revealed phenotypic and mechanistic differences between kreisler and its zebrafish equivalent valentino. while valentino is believed to subdivide preexisting segmental units, in the mouse kreisler specifies a particular segment. the formation of r6 independent of r5 argues against a role of kreisler in prorhombomeric segmentation of the mouse hindbrain. we conclude that the mouse kreisler gene regulates multiple steps in segmental patterning involving both the formation of segments and their a-p identity.
objectives: to determine whether an “optimal” distortion product otoacoustic emission (dpoae) protocol that (1) used optimal stimulus levels and primary-frequency ratios for each f2, (2) simultaneously measured 2f2 − f1 and 2f1 − f2 distortion products, (3) controlled source contribution, (4) implemented improved calibration techniques, (5) accounted for the influence of middle ear reflectance, and (6) applied multivariate analyses to dpoae data results in improved accuracy in differentiating between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired ears, compared with a standard clinical protocol. design: data were collected for f2 frequencies ranging from 0.75 to 8 khz in 28 normal-hearing and 78 hearing-impaired subjects. the protocol included a control condition incorporating standard stimulus levels and primary-frequency ratios calibrated with a standard spl method and three experimental conditions using optimized stimuli calibrated with an alternative forward pressure level method. the experimental conditions differed with respect to the level of the reflection-source suppressor tone and included conditions referred to as the null suppressor (i.e., no suppressor tone presented), low-level suppressor (i.e., suppressor tone presented at 58 db spl), and high-level suppressor (i.e., suppressor tone presented at 68 db spl) conditions. the area under receiver operating characteristic (aroc) curves and sensitivities for fixed specificities (and vice versa) were estimated to evaluate test performance in each condition. results: aroc analyses indicated (1) improved test performance in all conditions using multivariate analyses, (2) improved performance in the null suppressor and low suppressor experimental conditions compared with the control condition, and (3) poorer performance below 4 khz with the high-level suppressor. as expected from aroc, sensitivities for fixed specificities and specificities for fixed sensitivities were highest for the null suppressor and low suppressor conditions and lowest for standard clinical procedures. the influence of 2f2 − f1 and reflectance on test performance were negligible. conclusions: predictions of auditory status based on dpoae measurements in clinical protocols may be improved by the inclusion of (1) optimized stimuli, (2) alternative calibration techniques, (3) low-level suppressors, and (4) multivariate analyses. objectives 1) to determine whether multivariate statistical approaches improve the classification of normal and impaired ears based on distortion product otoacoustic emission (dpoae) measurements, in comparison with the results obtained with more traditional single-variable applications of clinical decision theory. 2) to determine how well the multivariate predictors, derived from analysis on a training group, generalized to a validation group. 3) to provide a way to apply the multivariate approaches clinically.   design areas under the relative operating characteristic (roc) curve and cumulative distributions derived from dpoae, dpoae/noise, discriminant function (df) scores and logit function (lf) scores were used to compare univariate and multivariate predictors of audiometric status. dpoae and noise amplitudes for 8 f2 frequencies were input to a discriminant analysis and to a logistic regression. these analyses generated a df and lf, respectively, composed of a linear combination of selected variables. the df and lf scores were the input variables to the decision theory analyses. for comparison purposes, dpoae test performance was also evaluated using only one variable (dpoae or dpoae/noise when f2 = audiometric frequency). analyses were based on data from over 1200 ears of 806 subjects, ranging in age from 1.3 to 96 yr, with thresholds ranging from -5 to >120 db hl. for statistical purposes, normal hearing was defined as thresholds of 20 db hl or better. for the multivariate analyses, the database was randomly divided into two groups of equal size. one group served as the "training" set, which was used to generate the dfs and lfs. the other group served as a "validation" set to determine the robustness of the df and lf solutions.   results for all test frequencies, multivariate analyses yielded greater areas under the roc curve than univariate analyses, and greater specificities at fixed sensitivities. within the multivariate techniques, discriminant analysis and logistic regression yielded similar results and both yielded robust solutions that generalized well to the validation groups. the improvement in test performance with multivariate analyses was greatest for conditions in which the single predictor variable resulted in the poorest performance.   conclusions a more accurate determination of auditory status at a specific frequency can be obtained by combining multiple predictor variables. although the df and lf multivariate approaches resulted in the greatest separation between normal and impaired distributions, overlap still exists, which suggests that there would be value in continued efforts to improve dpoae test performance.
a large number of genera in the tropical fish family characidae are incertae sedis. cytogenetic analysis was made of four of these species: astyanax eigenmanniorum, deuterodon stigmaturus, hyphessobrycon luetkenii, and h. anisitsi, collected from various hydrographic basins: hydrographic system from laguna dos patos/rs, tramandaí basin/rs and tibagi river basin/pr. the first two species were collected in their type locality in the state of rio grande do sul. the 2n = 48 karyotype was observed only in a. eigenmanniorum, while the other species had 2n = 50 chromosomes, with different karyotypic formulas. there was weak heterochromatin staining in the pericentromeric region of a. eigenmanniorum, d. stigmaturus and h. luetkenni chromosomes. in h. anisitsi, heterochromatin appeared to be more abundant and distributed in the pericentromeric and terminal regions of the chromosomes; three pairs showed more evident heterochromatic blocks. there were multiple ag-nors in all populations, visualized by fish with an 18s rdna probe. while d. stigmaturus and h. luetkenii had conserved agnor, cma3 and 18s rdna sites, the other two species showed intra- and interindividual variation at these sites. the karyotype variability was high, as is common in this group of fish. different species arising from isolated hydrographic basins maintain an elevated level of karyotype differentiation, mainly with respect to chromosome structure, heterochromatin distribution and rdna localization. this is the first report with cytogenetic data for d. stigmaturus and h. luetkenii. a cytogenetic study was conducted on an astyanax eigenmanniorum population from the caetano stream (18° 44' 56" s/ 048° 18' 39" w) - in uberlândia, mg, brazil - showing a modal diploid number of 48 chromosomes in the standard male and female karyotypes. however, in several specimens it was also possible to observe metaphases with one or two b chromosomes, increasing the diploid number to 49 or 50 chromosomes, respectively. the supernumerary chromosomes were totally heterochromatic and highlighted after c-banding. the silver-stained nucleolus organizing regions (ag-nors) were located in at least five chromosomes of the standard karyotype, thus characterizing a multiple nor system in the species. this is the first occurrence of an a. eigenmanniorum population with 2n = 48 chromosomes, bearing supernumerary chromosomes.
many water-breathing animals have a strategy that consists of maintaining low blood po2 values in a large range of water oxygenation level (4-40 kpa). this study examines the postprandial changes in o2 consumption, arterial blood po2, and tissue protein synthesis in the shore crab carcinus maenas in normoxic, o2-depleted, and o2-enriched waters to study the effects of this strategy on the o2 consumption and peptide bond formation after feeding. in normoxic water (21 kpa), the arterial po2 was 1.1 kpa before feeding and 1.2 kpa 24 h later. in water with a po2 of 3 kpa (arterial po2 0.6 kpa), postprandial stimulation of protein synthesis and o2 consumption were blocked. the blockade was partial at a water po2 of 4 kpa (arterial po2 0.8 kpa). an increase in environmental po2 (60 kpa, arterial po2 10 kpa) resulted in an increase in protein synthesis compared with normoxic rates. it is concluded that the arterial po2 spontaneously set in normoxic carcinus limits the rates of protein synthesis. the rationale for such a strategy is discussed. 1. a single high-dose injection of 14c- (or 3h-) phenylalanine was used for measurement of protein synthetic rates in tissues of toadfish, opsanus tau, in vivo. 2. average rates at 20 degrees c, as per cent of tissue protein synthesized per day, were as follows: liver, 14; head kidney, 15; gill, 7.7; spleen 5.0; heart, 2.3; testis, 1.4; epaxial and pectoral muscle, 0.20-0.23. elevated rates in muscle (0.71%/day) were found in fed fish. 3. temperature dependency (q10) in the 10-20 degrees c range averaged 6-7 for tissues with high rates of protein turnover, and 3-4 in heart and muscle after two-weeks acclimation.
aims/hypothesisthe incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 augments islet cell mass in vivo by increasing proliferation and decreasing apoptosis of the beta cells. however, the signalling pathways that mediate these effects are mostly unknown. using a clonal rat pancreatic beta cell line (ins-1), we examined the role of protein kinase b in mediating beta-cell growth and survival stimulated by glucagon-like peptide-1.methodsimmunoblot analysis was used to detect active (phospho-) and total protein kinase b. proliferation was assessed using 3h-thymidine incorporation, while apoptosis was quantitated using 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and apo percentage apoptosis assay. kinase-dead and wild-type protein kinase b was introduced into cells using adenoviral vectors.resultsglucagon-like peptide-1 rapidly activated protein kinase b in ins-1 cells (by 2.7±0.7-fold, p<0.05). this effect was completely abrogated by inhibition, with wortmannin, of the upstream activator of protein kinase b, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. glucagon-like peptide-1 also stimulated ins-1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (by 1.8±0.5-fold at 10−7 mol/l, p<0.01), and inhibited staurosporine-induced apoptosis (by 69±12%, p<0.05). both of these effects were also prevented by wortmannin treatment. ablation of protein kinase b by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the kinase-dead form of protein kinase bα prevented protein kinase b phosphorylation and completely abrogated both cellular proliferation (p<0.05) and protection from drug-induced cellular death (p<0.01) induced by glucagon-like peptide-1.conclusions/interpretationthese results identify protein kinase b as an essential mediator linking the glucagon-like peptide-1 signal to the intracellular machinery that modulates beta-cell growth and survival. non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm, type 2 diabetes) is a disorder of glucose homeostasis characterized by hyperglycaemia, peripheral insulin resistance, impaired hepatic glucose metabolism, and diminished glucose-dependent secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells1. glucagon-like-peptide-1(7-37) (glp-1)2 is an intestinally derived hormone that may be useful for the treatment of niddm because it acts in vivo to increase the level of circulating insulin, and thus lower the concentration of blood glucose3,4. this therapeutic effect may result from the ability of glp-1 to compensate for a defect in the glucose signalling pathway that regulates insulin secretion from β-cells. in support of this concept we report here that glp-1 confers glucose sensitivity to glucose-resistant p-cells, a phenomenon we term glucose competence. induction of glucose competence by glp-1 results from its synergistic interaction with glucose to inhibit metabolically regulated potassium channels that are also targeted for inhibition by sulphonylurea drugs commonly used in the treatment of niddm5. glucose competence allows membrane depolarization, the generation of action potentials, and ca2+ influx, events that are known to trigger insulin secretion6,7.
the anti-yeast activities of a food-grade dilution-stable microemulsion against candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae have been studied. the weight ratio of the formulated microemulsion is glycerol monolaurate (gml)/propionic acid/tween 80/sodium benzoate (sb)/water = 3:9:14:14:24. results of anti-yeast activity on solid medium by agar diffusion method showed that the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion at 4.8 mg/ml was comparable to that of natamycin at 0.1 mg/ml as positive control. results of anti-yeast activity in liquid medium by broth dilution method showed that the growth of both c. albicans and s. cerevisiae was completely inhibited when the liquid medium containing 106 cfu/ml was treated with 1.2 mg/ml microemulsion, which was determined as minimum fungicidal concentration. the kinetics of killing results showed that the microemulsion killed over 90% yeast cells rapidly within 15 min and caused a complete loss of viability in 120 min. among the components, sb and gml had a similar anti-yeast activity, followed by propionic acid, while tween 80 exhibited no activity and could not enhance the anti-yeast activities of these components, and it was revealed that the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion was attributed to a combination of propionic acid, gml, and sb. the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion was in good agreement with the leakage of 260-nm absorbing materials and the observation of transmission electron microscopy, indicating that the microemulsion induced the disruption and dysfunction of the cell membrane. some microemulsions and nanoemulsions may have antimicrobial properties and be effective anti-biofilm agents. we examined the abilities of two fine emulsions, designated bctp and teop, to inactivate suspensions of vegetative cells of salmonella spp. escherichia coli 0157:h7 (vt-), pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes. bctp is an o/w nanoemulsion of soybean oil and tri-n-butyl phosphate emulsified with triton x-100, while teop is an o/w microemulsion of ethyl oleate with tween 80 as emulsifier and n-pentanol as a co-emulsifier. bctp was effective in reducing the cell numbers of l. monocytogenes, while teop was effective against all five organisms investigated. the abilities of these emulsions to reduce preformed biofilms of the five bacteria were also investigated. with the exception of the biofilm formed by l. monocytogenes, which surprisingly was not significantly affected by bctp, all biofilms were inhibited by both bctp and teop.
the hypothesis tested in this study was that the self-etching system (clearfil se bond, cse) is less sensitive to surface moisture variability than the system that uses a separate acid-etching step (single bond, sb). eighteen dentin specimens were bonded to composite using cse or sb. three different surface moisture conditions per bonding type (overwet, w; dry, d; and visibly moist, n [normal]) were applied prior to bonding dentin to composite. one cross section of each sample was analyzed with lines of nanoindentations crossing perpendicular to the bonding interface. an additional set of bonded samples was fixed and cross sectioned before the hybrid layer thickness was measured in scanning electron microscopy. the nanoindentations revealed significant differences in indentation modulus (e(i)) and hardness (h) for the hybrid layer comparing sbn, e(i) = 2.7(+/-1.6); h = 0.24(+/-0.1) gpa with sbd, e(i) = 0.9(+/-0.7); h = 0.9(+/-0.05) gpa, respectively, while cse showed no differences among the groups. a significantly greater demineralized zone below the hybrid layer was found for sbd. the hybrid layer was wider for both csed and sbd. in conclusion the hypothesis was verified; cse exhibited no significant changes of hybrid layer properties (e(i), h) at different hydration conditions, while sb had significant differences, especially after air-drying. objective fractographic analysis was conducted to evaluate the resin-dentin bond structures made under wet and dry conditions.   methods resin-dentin bonded specimens were prepared using two adhesive resin systems (single bond/sb; 3m and all bond 2/ab2; bisco inc) under wet and dry conditions. the specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the adhesive interface to produce a square bar-shaped specimen (adhesive area: 0.9 mm(2)) by means of a diamond saw. the mean bond tensile test was then conducted at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/min. the mean bond strengths were statistically compared with two-way anova and fisher's plsd test (p<0.05). subsequently, the fractured surfaces of all specimens were examined using sem and the area fractions of failure modes (%) were measured using an image analyzer on sem microphotographs.   results no significant differences in tensile-bond strength were observed between sb (60.1+/-16.4mpa) and ab2 (69.8+/-17.4mpa) (p>0.05) under wet conditions. however, the bond strength either of sb or ab2 made under wet conditions was significantly greater than those made under dry conditions (sb: 26.2+/-12.5mpa and ab2: 6.8+/-3.3mpa) (p<0.05). under fractographic analysis, the major portion at the fractured surface was occupied by the cohesive failure of bonding resin and the resin composite for the wet conditions, and the top of the hybrid layer for the dry conditions in both systems.   significance the interaction between the top of the hybrid layer and the bonding resin influenced the bond integrity.
la qualite nutritionnelle des proteines alimentaires depend de deux parametres cles : la digestibilite ileale vraie et l’utilisation metabolique des acides amines (aa) absorbes. les objectifs de cette etude etaient de determiner l’influence de deux facteurs alimentaires (facteurs antinutritionnels et peptides) sur les flux ileaux de proteines endogenes; de valider la technique d’intubation utilisee chez l’homme pour prelever des effluents ileaux; de comparer le metabolisme postprandial d’aa alimentaires suivant leur forme d’ingestion; d’evaluer la validite du modele porc pour predire la digestibilite proteique chez l’homme. les investigations se sont deroulees chez le rat, le porc et l’homme. les effluents ileaux etaient collectes chez le rat apres euthanasie, chez le porc vivant equipe d’une canule en aval de la valve ileo-caecal et chez l’homme conscient equipe d’une sonde naso-ileale. l’azote (n) et les aa endogenes ileaux etaient determines suite a un repas proteiprive (pp), un repas contenant de la caseine, intacte (c) ou hydrolysee (hc), marquee avec l’isotope stable 15n ou un repas a base d’aa libres (a) mimant la composition de la caseine et prive de certains aa non essentiels afin de mesurer directement leur flux endogenes. de plus, la centrifugation et ultrafiltration des effluents hc permettaient de determiner les proteines endogenes ileales et le recyclage d’n alimentaire (15n). les facteurs antinutritionnels issus d’un extrait brut de haricots (phaseolus vulgaris), ingeres au niveau habituel de consommation chez l’homme, augmentaient les flux ileaux de proteines endogenes (rat, repas pp). apres adaptation au repas, le bilan azote corporel per se n’avait pas d’influence sur les flux ileaux de proteines endogenes (rat, repas pf et a) mais les peptides alimentaires (repas hc) augmentaient les flux ileaux d’aa et n endogenes par rapport au repas pp. les peptides alimentaires (hc), compares aux peptides liberes naturellement dans l’intestin au cours de la digestion (c), n’augmentaient pas les flux ileaux de proteines endogenes (rat, porc, homme). le recyclage d’n alimentaire dans les proteines endogenes etait maximal chez le rat nourri en continu, plus faible chez le porc nourri en aigu et minimum chez l’homme nourri en aigu (respectivement : 65, 21 et 11%). par ailleurs, ces recherches ont montre que l’intubation naso-ileale utilisee pour prelever des effluents ileaux chez l’homme etait une methode juste et que le porc etait un modele valide pour predire la digestibilite ileale vraie chez l’homme. enfin, la forme d’ingestion des aa alimentaires (hc ou c) influencaient le devenir metabolique des aa alimentaires, en particulier par rapport aux cinetiques de catabolisme des aa. cependant, la valeur nutritionnelle etait, au final, similaire pour hc et c. the aim of the study was to determine if there is a difference between ileal and faecal assays for determining amino acid and n digestibilities in adult human subjects. comparison of true ileal amino acid and n digestibilities was also made between adult human subjects and growing pigs to establish the usefulness of the pig as a model animal. five subjects with established ileostomies and six subjects with intact large bowels consumed a constant diet consisting of meat, vegetables, fruit, bread and dairy products for 7 d with collection of ileostomy contents or faeces respectively over the last 4 d. the study was repeated using 25 kg body weight ileostomized and intact pigs. apparent amino acid and n digestibility coefficients were determined. for human subjects the faecal digestibility values were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the ileal values for arg, asp, gly, phe, pro, ser, thr and trp. the faecal digestibility of met was significantly lower than the ileal value. determination of dna, diaminopimelic acid (dapa) and the digestibilities of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose in human subjects indicated that some microbial colonization had occurred at the terminal ileum after formation of an ileostomy; however, this was not as extensive as in the large intestine. true ileum amino acid and n digestibilities were calculated after correcting for the endogenous contribution of amino acids at the terminal ileum determined using a protein-free diet. there were no significant differences between adult human subjects and pigs for true ileal dietary amino acid digestibility except for thr, phe, cys and met. there were no significant differences between adult humans and pigs for the ileal digestibility of dry matter and the faecal digestibility of gross energy.
changes in snow cover might influence arctic ecosystems to the same extent as increased temperatures. although the duration of snow cover is generally expected to decrease in the future as a result of global warming, the amounts of snow might increase in arctic areas where much of the elevated precipitation will fall as snow. we examined the effects of an increased snow cover, as a result of a snow fence treatment, on soil nitrogen mineralization, plant phenology, plant chemistry (nitrogen and potential defense compounds), the level of invertebrate herbivory, and performance of invertebrate herbivores in an arctic ecosystem, using dwarf birch (betula nana) and the autumnal moth (epirrita autumnata) as study organisms. an enhanced and prolonged snow cover increased the level of herbivory on dwarf birch leaves. larvae feeding on plants that had experienced enhanced snow cover grew faster and pupated earlier than larvae fed with plant material from control plots, indicating that plants from enhanced snow-lie plots produce higher-quality food to herbivores. the increased larval growth rate was strongly correlated with higher leaf nitrogen concentration in plants subjected to snow manipulation, and also to certain phenolic acids. snow manipulation did not change net nitrogen mineralization rates in the soil or total carbon concentration in leaves, but it altered the within-season fluctuating pattern of leaf phenolic compounds. this study demonstrates a positive relationship between increased snow cover and level of herbivory on deciduous shrubs, thus proposing a negative feedback on the climate-induced dwarf shrub expansion in arctic areas. insect damage changes plant physiology and chemistry, and such changes may influence the performance of herbivores. we introduced larvae of the autumnal moth (epirrita autumnataborkh.) on individual branches of its main host plant, mountain birch (betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (orlova) hämet-ahti) to examine rapid-induced plant responses, which may affect subsequent larval development. we measured systemic responses to herbivory by analyzing chemistry, photosynthesis, and leaf growth, as well as effects on larval growth and feeding, in undamaged branches of damaged and control trees. larvae reared on leaves from intact branches of the herbivore-damaged trees grew faster than those reared on leaves of control trees, indicating systemic-induced susceptibility. herbivore damage did not lead to systemic changes in levels of primary nutrients or phenolic compounds. the analyses of photosynthetic activity and individual hydrolyzable tannins revealed a reversal of leaf physiology-herbivore defense patterns. on control trees, consumption by e. autumnata larvae was positively correlated with photosynthetic activity; on damaged trees, this correlation was reversed, with consumption being negatively correlated with photosynthetic activity. a similar pattern was found in the relationship between monogalloylglucose, the most abundant hydrolyzable tannin of mountain birch, and leaf consumption. among the control trees, consumption was positively correlated with concentrations of monogalloylglucose, whereas among herbivore-damaged trees, this correlation was reversed and became negative. our results suggest that herbivore performance is related to both concentrations of phenolic compounds and photosynthetic activity in leaves. this linkage between herbivore performance, leaf chemistry, and physiology was sensitive to induced plant responses caused by slight herbivore damage.
we have used single‐ and double‐labeling immunfluorescence and reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (rt‐pcr) methods to examine expression of p2x receptor subtypes on microglial cells of brain in late embryonic and postnatal rat, in the n9 microglial cell line and primary cultured microglial cells. p2x1, p2x4, and p2x7 receptors were shown on microglial cells from late embryonic day 16. almost all the microglial cells that were positive for the marker ed1, expressed p2x1 and p2x4 receptors, whereas only about 30% of the cells with ed1‐immunoreactivity were found to express the p2x7 receptor. positive cells were localized mainly in the white matter and around ventricles. from postnatal day 7, many microglial cells with p2x4 receptor‐immunoreactivity were seen around the blood vessels. at postnatal day 30, microglial cells with p2x1 receptor‐immunoreactivity disappeared and the cells with p2x4 receptor‐immunoreactivity were mainly localized around blood vessels and lining the subarachnoid space. from postnatal day 30, the microglial cells with p2x7 receptor‐immunoreactivity were found to be distributed widely in the forebrain. cells with p2x7 receptor‐immunoreactivity from p30 were not labeled by ed1, but some were labeled by isolectin b4. the expression of p2x1, p2x4, and p2x7 receptor mrna and protein on primary cultures of rat microglial cells and on the n9 microglial cell line was demonstrated with immunocytochemistry and rt‐pcr. this is the first report that the p2x1 receptor is expressed on microglial cells, at least in early development, before postnatal day 30. © 2005 wiley‐liss, inc. 1 our aim was to assess whether atp‐induced inward currents in microglia are due to a single or more than one purinergic receptor. the atp dose‐response curve showed two components, whose presence might be due to the activation of high and low affinity receptors. 2 the p2z/p2x7 specific receptor agonist benzoylbenzoyl‐atp (bz‐atp) and some p2 receptor agonists were tested. the rank order of potency was bz‐atp >> atp = 2‐methylthio‐atp (2‐mesatp) > α,β‐methylene atp (α,β‐meatp) ≥ adp. β,γ‐methyleneatp (β,γ‐meatp), utp and adenosine were ineffective. 3 the non‐specific p2 receptor antagonist suramin antagonized by 92 ± 2 % the inward current induced by 100 μm atp, and by 51 ± 8 and 68 ± 6 % those induced by 3 mm atp and 100 μm bz‐atp, respectively. the p2z/p2x7 antagonist oxidized atp (oatp) almost abolished the inward current induced by 3 mm atp or bz‐atp, but was ineffective against 100 μm atp. 4 inward currents induced by low atp concentrations (≤ 100 μm) were generally followed by an almost complete and irreversible desensitization, while those elicited by atp ≥ 1 mm showed only a partial decline. interestingly, the inward current induced by 100 μm 2‐mesatp showed a large desensitization, while that induced by bz‐atp did not. 5 in voltage‐ramp experiments, the 100 μm atp‐induced current exhibited a slight inward rectification more visible at negative potentials, while the 3 mm atp‐induced current did not. 6 atp induced a fast and large increase in [ca2+] that promptly recovered in the continuous presence of low atp doses, but did not recover in high atp doses. as with desensitization, the response to bz‐atp mimicked that of high doses of atp. 7 when ca2+ mobilization due to p2y receptors was blocked by thapsigargin‐induced ca2+ depletion or by pertussis toxin treatment, 10 μm atp was still able to induce a ca2+ transient, which represented the contribution of the ca2+ influx induced by p2x receptors 8 in conclusion, the inward currents and a fraction of the ca2+ transients induced by atp in microglia are due to at least two atp‐sensitive receptor channel types, whose different properties and sensitivity to atp may be associated with different functional roles.
the current study represents the effect of varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 %) of sugar mill wastewater on growth, biochemistry, and physiology of two maize cultivars (pak-afgoi and ev-5098) at seedling, silking, and grain-filling growth stages. it was observed that lower levels of sugar mill wastewater (25 and 50 %) resulted in increase in chlorophyll contents and plant fresh and dry masses. in addition, sugar mill wastewater caused a consistent increase in rmp, sod activity, mda and h2o2 concentrations, and decrease in ascorbic acid concentration and activities of pod and cat. of the two cultivars, hazardous effects of high concentrations of sugar mill wastewater were more prominent in cv. ev-5098 that exhibited lower chlorophyll contents, fresh and dry masses and lower activities of enzymatic antioxidants and concentrations of non-enzymatic antioxidants. however, cv. pak-afgoi tolerated higher levels of sugar mill wastewater in terms of lower endogenous concentrations of mda and h2o2 and better antioxidant defense system. of different growth stages, seedling and grain-filling stages proved to be more sensitive to the application of sugar mill wastewater. overall, the results suggested that diluted sugar mill wastewater (≤50 %) can be used safely for irrigation purpose of maize plants. nitro blue tetrazolium has been used to intercept o2− generated enzymically or photochemically. the reduction of nbt by o2− has been utilized as the basis of assays for superoxide dismutase, which exposes its presence by inhibiting the reduction of nbt. superoxide dismutase could thus be assayed either in crude extracts or in purified protein fractions. the assays described are sensitive to ng/ml levels of super-oxide dismutase and were applicable in free solution or on polyacrylamide gels. the staining procedure for localizing superoxide dismutase on polyacrylamide electrophoretograms has been applied to extracts obtained from a variety of sources. e. coli has been found to contain two superoxide dismutases whereas bovine heart, brain, lung, and erthrocytes contain only one.
saccadic eye movements generated in response to a gap paradigm in which the fixation light spot was extinguished 200 ms prior to presentation of the target light spot showed appreciably shorter latencies than for the overlap paradigm in which the target light spot was presented 200 ms prior to extinction of the fixation light spot. when there was unpredictability in the direction of target presentation, i.e., to the left or right of the fixation light spot, the gap paradigm evoked mainly fast regular saccades of peak latency of 155 ms with relatively few express saccades which were defined as having latencies of less than 120 ms. by contrast, when the target always appeared to the right, a substantial population of express saccades with peak latency 95 ms was now generated. there was also a change in the relationship between saccadic latency and target angular displacement which covered the range 5-35 degrees . with the overlap paradigm and unpredictability of target direction, the latencies of the slow regular saccades increased markedly with target angular displacement. this was not the case with the same target direction when the latency of slow regular, fast regular, and express saccades remained constant with increasing target angular displacement. this indicates for targets appearing in the same hemifield that the ocular motor system operates with shortest latency irrespective of target angular displacement. backgroundpredictions from conduction velocity data for primate retinal ganglion cell axons indicate that the conduction time to the lateral geniculate nucleus for stimulation of peripheral retina should be no longer than for stimulation of central retina. on this basis, the latency of saccadic eye movements should not increase for more peripherally located targets. however, previous studies have reported relatively very large increases, which has the implication of a very considerable increase in central processing time for the saccade-generating system.resultsin order to resolve this paradox, we have undertaken an extended series of experiments in which saccadic eye movements were recorded by electro-oculography in response to targets presented in the horizontal meridian in normal young subjects. for stationary or moving targets of either normal beam intensity or reduced red intensity, with the direction of gaze either straight ahead with respect to the head or directed eccentrically, the saccadic latency was shown to remain invariant with respect to a wide range of target angular displacements.conclusionsthese results indicate that, irrespective of the angular displacement of the target, the direction of gaze or the target intensity, the saccade-generating system operates with a constant generation time.
alveolar macrophages (ams) primed with lps and treated with concentrated ambient air particles (caps) showed enhanced release of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and provide an in vitro model for the amplified effects of air pollution particles seen in people with preexisting lung disease. to investigate the mechanism(s) by which caps mediate tnf release in primed rat ams, we first tested the effect of a panel of antioxidants. n-acetyl-l-cysteine (20 mm), dimethyl thiourea (20 mm) and catalase (5 microm) significantly inhibited tnf release by primed ams incubated with caps. conversely, when lps-primed ams were treated with caps in the presence of exogenous oxidants (h(2)o(2) generated by glucose oxidase, 10 microm/h), tnf release and cell toxicity was significantly increased. the soluble fraction of caps suspensions caused most of the increased bioactivity in the presence of exogenous h(2)o(2). the metal chelator deferoxamine (dfo) strongly inhibited the interaction of the soluble fraction with h(2)o(2) but had no effect on the bioactivity of the insoluble caps fraction. we conclude that caps can mediate their effects in primed ams by acting on oxidant-sensitive cytokine release in at least two distinct ways. in the primed cell, insoluble components of pm mediate enhanced tnf production that is h(2)o(2)-dependent (catalase-sensitive) yet independent of iron (dfo-insensitive). in the presence of exogenous h(2)o(2) released by ams, pmns, or other lung cells within an inflamed alveolar milieu, soluble iron released from air particles can also mediate cytokine release and cell toxicity. we sought to characterize the bioactive constituents of concentrated ambient air particles (caps) through correlation of alveolar macrophage (am) biological responses (production of tnf, macrophage inflammatory protein (mip-2), nitrite; cell viability) to components of particle samples. caps samples collected on different days showed a range of bioactivity and a strong correlation was found between am cytokine release and increased am light scatter, a flow cytometric measure of relative particle load. evaluation of soluble and insoluble fractions of caps suspensions indicate that 1) most biological effects on ams are mediated by insoluble components and certain particle adsorbed factors such as endotoxin; 2) the variable bioactivity of caps collected on different days arises primarily from differences in the relative proportion of insoluble and soluble mass present in particle suspensions; and 3) the activation state of the am influences which insoluble components are most bioactive. use of endotoxin neutralizing agents (e.g., polymyxin-b) showed particle-adsorbed endotoxin in caps suspensions causes activation of normal (control) ams while other (nonendotoxin) components are predominantly responsible for the enhanced cytokine release observed by primed ams incubated with caps. the am biological response did not correlate with any of a panel of elements quantified within insoluble caps samples (al, cd, cr, cu, fe, mg, mn, ni, s, ti, v). these data demonstrate an important role for cell activation and phagocytosis of insoluble particulate matter in the response of ams to caps suspensions.
lizardi d, grunebaum mf, burke a, stanley b, mann jj, harkavy‐friedman j, oquendo m. the effect of social adjustment and attachment style on suicidal behaviour. objective to describe the prevalence of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in a birth cohort of new zealand children studied to the age of 16 years; to examine the extent to which risks of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation varied with levels of adolescent psychopathology, problems of adjustment, and exposure to adverse conditions during childhood; and to examine the extent to which those attempting suicide could be distinguished from those reporting suicidal ideation alone.   method data were gathered on suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, psychiatric diagnoses, adjustment problems, and childhood factors during the course of a 16-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of new zealand children.   results twelve percent of this cohort reported suicidal ideation before the age of 16 years and 3% attempted suicide. the extent to which young people expressed suicidal tendencies varied with the extent to which the young person met criteria for psychiatric disorder, the extent of adjustment problems, and the extent to which the young person had been exposed to adverse family circumstances. those attempting suicide were distinguished from those reporting suicidal ideation by having significantly higher rates of psychopathology (p < .05), higher rates of adjustment problems (p < .005), and greater exposure to childhood and family adversity (p < .05).   conclusion the results of this analysis were consistent with a dimensional model of suicidal behaviors in which those attempting suicide are distinguished from those reporting suicidal ideation alone by having a greater burden of psychosocial risk factors including psychiatric disorder, adjustment problems, and adverse childhood circumstances.
lead (pb) is a major chemical pollutant of the environment. it has been associated with human activities for the last 6000 years. quite rightly, it remains a public health concern today. the present investigation evaluates the toxic potential of pb in larvae of the toad xenopus laevis after 12 days exposure in lab conditions. acute toxicity, genotoxicity and pb bioaccumulation were analyzed. the genotoxic effects were analyzed in the circulating blood from the levels of micronucleus induction according to the french standard micronucleus assay (afnor 2000 association française de normalization. norme nft 90-325. qualité de l’eau. evaluation de la génotoxicité au moyen de larves d’amphibien (xenopus laevis, pleurodeles waltl)). lead bioaccumulation was analyzed in the liver of larvae at the end of exposure. moreover, the toxic potential of lead, in aquatic media, was investigated in the presence of meat and bone meal combustion residues (mbmcr) known to be rich in phosphates and a potential immobiliser of lead. previously, acute toxicity and genotoxicity of mbmcr alone were evaluated using xenopus larvae. the results obtained in the present study demonstrated: (i) that lead is acutely toxic and genotoxic to amphibian larvae from 1 mg pb/l and its bioaccumulation is significant in the liver of larvae from the lowest concentration of exposure (1 μg pb/l), (ii) mbmcr were not acutely toxic nor genotoxic in xenopus larvae, (iii) lead in presence of mbmcr induced inhibition or reduction of the toxic and genotoxic potential of lead in water at concentrations that do not exceed the capacity of mbmcr of pb-binding (iv) pb accumulation in larvae exposed to lead with mbmcr in water was lower than pb-accumulation in larvae exposed to lead alone except at the concentration of 0.01 mg pb/l suggesting complex mechanisms of mbmcr interaction in organisms. the results confirm the high toxicity and genotoxicity of lead in the aquatic compartment and suggest the potential utility of mbmcr for use in remediation. pickerel frogs (rana palustris) and bullfrogs (rana catesbeiana) were exposed from the egg stage to lead-contaminated surface water from a trap and skeet range. seven experimental treatments were employed: 25, 50, 75 and 100% range water, 100% range water plus a chelating agent (sodium citrate), control water and control water plus chelating agent. total lead concentrations in 100% range water treatments varied from 840-3150 microg litre(-1), with the filterable form accounting for approximately 4-5% of the total. hatching was not affected in either species (p > 0.2). there were highly significant differences in mortality among treatments for r. palustris (p = 0.0001), with tadpoles exhibiting 100 and 98% mortality after 10 d of exposure to 100 and 75% range water, respectively. mortality in the 100% range water + citrate treatment was similar to controls (p > 0.05). there were no significant differences in mortality among treatments for r. catesbeiana after 10 d of exposure (p = 0.7119). exposure to lead in the range water did not adversely affect the growth of surviving r. palustris or r. catesbeiana tadpoles after 14 weeks and 10 weeks, respectively. in both species, the intestinal mucosa in tadpoles exposed to range water was reduced in thickness. scanning electron micrographs of r. palustris tadpoles that died in 100% range water revealed stunted tail growth, incurvation of the spine, hydropsy and generally reduced body size.
chronic stress, the administration of glucocorticoids and the prolonged activation of glucocorticoid receptors (grs) are reported to induce affective changes in humans and rodents that resemble a depressive state. however, data concerning the behavioral and molecular effects of the selective activation of specific grs are limited, and the conclusions derived remain debatable. in this study, our goal was to investigate the behavioral and molecular changes following the prolonged activation of grs in mice via exposure to the specific agonist dexamethasone (dex). c57bl/6j mice were injected daily with dex (4 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, and the behavior of the animals was assessed in the following paradigms: the forced swimming test (fst), the light-dark box test, the saccharin preference test and activity boxes. the mrna expression levels of the corticosteroid receptors mineralocorticoid (mr, nr3c2) and glucocorticoid (gr, nr3c1), selected stress dependent genes and glial markers were analyzed in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. dex-treated mice exhibited a variety of depression-like behaviors: increased time of immobility in the fst, a reduced preference for saccharin consumption and increased anxiety-like behavior. behavioral alterations were accompanied by a decrease in the mrna expression of gr and the increased expression of fkbp5 and sgk1 in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of dex-treated mice. furthermore, our results indicate a decrease in the mrna expression of glutamate aspartate transporter (glast, slc1a3), an astroglial cell marker, in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. these results demonstrate that the prolonged activation of gr receptors induced a depression-like state in mice, activated stress-related genes and induced a decrease in the mrna expression of glast, an astroglial marker, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. together, the results reported here challenge several hypotheses concerning the role of grs in the development of behavioral and molecular alterations relevant to stress-related disorders, such as depression, under the same experimental conditions. glucocorticoids stimulate the intestinal absorption of na(+) and water partly by regulation of the na(+)/h(+) exchanger 3 (nhe3). previous studies have shown both genomic and nongenomic regulation of nhe3 by glucocorticoids. serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (sgk1) has been shown to be part of this cascade, where phosphorylation of nhe3 by sgk1 initiates the translocation of nhe3 to the cell surface. in the present work, we examined a series of changes in sgk1 and nhe3 induced by glucocorticoids using human colonic caco-2 and opossum kidney cells. we found that dexamethasone rapidly stimulated sgk1 mrnas, but a significant change in protein abundance was not detected. instead, there was an increase in sgk1 kinase activity as early as at 2 h. an increase in nhe3 protein abundance was not detected until 12 h of dexamethasone exposure, although the transport activity was significantly stimulated at 4 h. these data demonstrate that the changes of sgk1 precede those of nhe3. chronic regulation (24 h) of nhe3 was blocked completely by prevention of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or actinomycin d and by the glucocorticoid receptor blocker ru486. the acute effect of dexamethasone was similarly abrogated by ru486, but was insensitive to cycloheximide and actinomycin d. similarly, the stimulation of sgk1 activity by dexamethasone was blocked by ru486 but not by actinomycin d. together, these data show that the acute effect of glucocorticoids on nhe3 is mediated by a glucocorticoid receptor dependent mechanism that activates sgk1 in a nongenomic manner.
the present study aims to evaluate the effect of selenium supplementation on lipid peroxidation and lactate levels in rats subjected to acute swimming exercise. thirty-two adult male rats of sprague–dawley type were divided into four groups. group 1, control; group 2, selenium-supplemented; group 3, swimming control; group 4, selenium-supplemented swimming group. the animals in groups 2 and 4 were supplemented with (i.p.) 6 mg/kg/day sodium selenite for 4 weeks. the blood samples taken from the animals by decapitation method were analyzed in terms of erythrocyte-reduced glutathione (gsh), serum glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and superoxide dismutase (sod), and plasma malondialdehyde (mda) and lactate using the colorimetric method, and serum selenium values using an atomic emission device. in the study, the highest mda and lactate values were found in group 3, while the highest gsh, gpx and sod values were obtained in group 4 (p < 0,001). group 2 had the highest and group 3 had the lowest selenium levels (p < 0,001). results of the study indicate that the increase in free radical production and lactate levels due to acute swimming exercise in rats might be offset by selenium supplementation. selenium supplementation may be important in that it supports the antioxidant system in physical activity. dietary intake of selenium has been implicated in a wide range of health issues, including aging, heart disease and cancer. selenium deficiency, which can reduce selenoprotein levels, has been associated with several striated muscle pathologies. to investigate the role of selenoproteins in skeletal muscle biology, we used a transgenic mouse (referred to as i6a-) that has reduced levels of selenoproteins due to the introduction and expression of a dominantly acting mutant form of selenocysteine transfer rna (trna[ser]sec). as a consequence, each organ contains reduced levels of most selenoproteins, yet these mice are normal with regard to fertility, overall health, behavior and blood chemistries. in the present study, although skeletal muscles from i6a- mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from those of wild-type mice, plantaris muscles were approximately 50% heavier after synergist ablation, a model of exercise overload. like muscle in wild-type mice, the enhanced growth in the i6a- mice was completely blocked by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) pathway. muscles of transgenic mice exhibited increased site-specific phosphorylation on both akt and p70 ribosomal s6 kinase (p70s6k) (p < 0.05) before ablation, perhaps accounting for the enhanced response to synergist ablation. thus, a single genetic alteration resulted in enhanced skeletal muscle adaptation after exercise, and this is likely through subtle changes in the resting phosphorylation state of growth-related kinases.
we have identified and characterized a zebrafish recessive maternal effect mutant, ichabod, that results in severe anterior and dorsal defects during early development. the ichabod mutation is almost completely penetrant, but exhibits variable expressivity. all mutant embryos fail to form a normal embryonic shield; most fail to form a head and notochord and have excessive development of ventral tail fin tissue and blood. abnormal dorsal patterning can first be observed at 3.5 hpf by the lack of nuclear accumulation of (beta)-catenin in the dorsal yolk syncytial layer, which also fails to express bozozok/dharma/nieuwkoid and znr2/ndr1/squint. at the onset of gastrulation, deficiencies in expression of dorsal markers and expansion of expression of markers of ventral tissues indicate a dramatic alteration of dorsoventral identity. injection of (beta)-catenin rna markedly dorsalized ichabod embryos and often completely rescued the phenotype, but no measurable dorsalization was obtained with rnas encoding upstream wnt pathway components. in contrast, dorsalization was obtained when rnas encoding either bozozok/dharma/nieuwkoid or znr2/ndr1/squint were injected. moreover, injection of (beta)-catenin rna into ichabod embryos resulted in activation of expression of these two genes, which could also activate each other. rna injection experiments strongly suggest that the component affected by the ichabod mutation acts on a step affecting (beta)-catenin nuclear localization that is independent of regulation of (beta)-catenin stability. this work demonstrates that a maternal gene controlling localization of (beta)-catenin in dorsal nuclei is necessary for dorsal yolk syncytial layer gene activity and formation of the organizer in the zebrafish. goosecoid (gsc) is an evolutionarily conserved homeobox gene expressed in the gastrula organizer region of a variety of vertebrate embryos, including zebrafish, xenopus, chicken and mouse. to understand the role of gsc during mouse embryogenesis, we generated gsc-null mice by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. surprisingly, gsc-null embryos gastrulated and formed the primary body axes; gsc-null mice were born alive but died soon after birth with numerous craniofacial defects. in addition, rib fusions and sternum abnormalities were detected that varied depending upon the genetic background. transplantation experiments suggest that the ovary does not provide gsc function to rescue gastrulation defects. these results demonstrate that gsc is not essential for organizer activity in the mouse but is required later during embryogenesis for craniofacial and rib cage development.
the purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of fatigue on the response of the trunk to various combinations of initial static loads and step inputed loads causing rapid sagittal trunk flexion. when attempting to overcome the moments associated with sudden loading, the spine maintains stabilty by increasing joint compression forces (cholewicki & mcgill, 1996) and increasing the level of muscle coactivation, even if it may result in an increased rate of fatigue (zetterberg et al., 1987). in a study that determined the response of the spine to sudden loads causing sagittal flexion, it was found that abdominal muscles rapidly responded to the sudden load with a large increase in muscle activation (krajcarski et al., 1999). also, krajcarski et al. concluded that increases in emg amplitudes of abdominal and trunk extensor muscles were determined predominantly by the added load magnitude and not the pre-loads. chiang (in press) conducted a similar study with the difference being the trunk motion investigated was lateral bend instead of trunk flexion. similar to krajcarski et al. (1999), chiang (in press) concluded that increased muscular activity due to pre-loads leads to increases in trunk muscle stiffness and spine stability. krajcarski et al (1999) and chiang (in press) have provided a greater understanding of the active muscular response that is responsible for maintaining stability. these two studies have demonstrated that a greater preload will result in an increase in trunk stiffness, which is beneficial to the stability of the spine when exposed to sudden loads. unfortunately, the increased trunk stiffness also contributes to trunk muscle fatigue because an increase in muscular activity is what causes the increased stiffness of the trunk. since, muscle fatigue has an effect on the ability of the spine to maintain stability, it would be of significant interest to determine whether a fatigued trunk system responds differently to the preand added loads that were described by krajcarski et al (1999). objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the protein aequorin were used to investigate the transient change in cytosolic calcium ions caused by stimulation through the fungal elicitor pep-25. our results show that the elicitor pep-25 derived from phytophthora sojae can induce h2o2 production and an increase in cytosolic calcium ions. the transcription of lox, opr3, ped, aos, aoc genes and the protein accumulation of aos were induced by pep-25 treatment. pep-25 also induced an accumulation of jasmonic acid (ja). blocking the production of h2o2 and the increase of cytosolic calcium ions both suppressed the transcription of lox, opr3, ped, aos, aoc genes, the accumulation of aos, and the accumulation of ja. these results indicated that the production of h2o2 derived from the plasma-membrane nadph oxidase and the subsequently increase of cytosolic calcium ions are both required for the activation of the octadecanoid pathway by pep-25 treatment in a. thaliana. transient influx of ca2+ constitutes an early element of signaling cascades triggering pathogen defense responses in plant cells. treatment with the phytophthora sojae–derived oligopeptide elicitor, pep-13, of parsley cells stably expressing apoaequorin revealed a rapid increase in cytoplasmic free calcium ([ca2+]cyt), which peaked at ∼1 μm and subsequently declined to sustained values of 300 nm. activation of this biphasic [ca2+]cyt signature was achieved by elicitor concentrations sufficient to stimulate ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, oxidative burst, and phytoalexin production. sustained concentrations of [ca2+]cyt but not the rapidly induced [ca2+]cyt transient peak are required for activation of defense-associated responses. modulation by pharmacological effectors of ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane or of ca2+ release from internal stores suggests that the elicitor-induced sustained increase of [ca2+]cyt predominantly results from the influx of extracellular ca2+. identical structural features of pep-13 were found to be essential for receptor binding, increases in [ca2+]cyt, and activation of defense-associated responses. thus, a receptor-mediated increase in [ca2+]cyt is causally involved in signaling the activation of pathogen defense in parsley.
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) affects 5%–8% of children in the u.s. (10% of males and 4% of females). the contributions of multiple metal exposures to the childhood behavioral deficits are unclear, although particular metals have been implicated through their neurotoxicity. the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the body burden of mn is positively correlated with adhd symptoms. we also investigated the putative roles of ca, fe, pb, and hg. we collected shed molars from 266 children (138 boys and 128 girls) who lost a tooth between 11 and 13 years of age. the molars were analyzed for metals using icp-oes. the third grade teacher of each child completed the teacher’s disruptive behavior disorders rating scale (dbd) to produce a score for “total disruptive behavior” and subscale scores for “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder”, hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention, and oppositional/defiant. the mean mn, fe, pb and ca concentrations found in teeth was 3.1 ± 2.9 µg/g, 11.4 ± 12.1 µg/g, 0.5 ± 0.7 µg/g, and 3.0 × 105 ± 0.8 × 105 µg/g, respectively. hg was not detected. no significant association was found between mn and behavioral deficits. ca was significantly negatively associated, and pb showed a significant positive association with hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention, and oppositional/defiant disorders. these findings call into question the putative independent association of manganese exposure and behavioral deficits in children, when the balance of other metallic burden, particularly ca and pb burdens play significant roles. iron plays a role in the regulation of dopaminergic activity. in the present study, nonanemic children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) were evaluated with regard to heme and nonheme iron metabolism and the effect of short-term iron administration on behavior. the study group consisted of 14 boys aged 7-11 years. all first underwent testing to rule out other psychiatric and medical problems. the severity of the adhd symptoms was determined by parent and teacher scores on the connors rating scale. thereafter, each patient received an iron preparation (ferrocal), 5 mg/kg/day for 30 days. blood samples were taken before and after drug administration. results showed a significant increase in serum ferritin levels (from 25.9 +/- 9.2 to 44.6 +/- 18 ng/ml) and a significant decrease on the parents' connors rating scale scores (from 17.6 +/- 4.5 to 12.7 +/- 5.4). there were no changes in other blood parameters or in the teachers' scores on the rating scale. the effect of iron supplementation on the behavioral and cognitive symptoms in noniron-deficient adhd children merits further investigation using a placebo-controlled study.
chlorella vulgaris (cv) was examined for its modulating effects on the reduction induced by lead (pb) on the numbers of marrow hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) (c-kit(+)lin(-)), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (gr1(+)mac1(+)) and total bone marrow cellularity. in mice gavage-treated daily with 50mg/kg dose of cv for 10 days, concomitant to a continuous offering of 1300 ppm lead acetate in drinking water, the treatment with the algae recovered the significantly reduced numbers of these cell populations to control values. as cv may have a myelostimulating effect through the induction of cytokines, we evaluated its modulating effects on the production of il-1α, tnf-α, ifn-γ, il-10 and il-6. our results demonstrated that lead significantly impairs the production of ifn-γ, il-1α and tnf-α and increases the production of il-10 and il-6 and that these effects are successfully modulated by the cv treatment. the activity of nk cells, reduced in pb-exposed animals, was raised to levels higher than those of controls in the exposed group treated with cv. treatment with the algae also stimulated the production of ifn-γ, il-1α, tnf-α and nk cells activity in normal mice. in addition, zinc bone concentrations, reduced in lead-exposed mice, were partially, but significantly, reversed by the treatment with cv. the host-mediated antiviral effect of chlorella vulgaris extracts (cve) was evaluated in icr mice against murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) infection. mice treated with 10 mg of cve on days 3 and 1 before virus challenge survived lethal infection. the protective effect of cve was shown by a decrease in the infectious viruses replicated in the target organs of cve-treated icr mice. cve also protected mice from histopathological damage to the target organs due to mcmv infection. both the serum interferon (ifn) level and 2'5'-oligoadenylate (2-5a) synthetase activity were elevated in cve-treated and mcmv-infected mice, and were higher than those in the control mice. the natural killer (nk) activity of spleen cells, which is otherwise deteriorated by lethal mcmv infection, was remarkably augmented in cve-treated mice. neither virocidal nor virostatic activity of cve on mcmv was seen in vitro. thus, cve-induced resistance against mcmv seems to be host-mediated. the protective effect correlated with the augmentation of nk activity of the spleen cells and serum ifn activity, which inhibited replication of mcmv in the target organs and subsequently saved the mice from death.
background: lhx8 is an important gene for craniofacial development, but its regulation had been poorly understood. results: we identified a face enhancer of lhx8 and discovered that it was regulated by wnt/β-catenin signaling. conclusion: wnt/β-catenin pathway directly regulates lhx8 in the face via a distal enhancer. significance: we uncovered a molecular mechanism for the regulation of lhx8 in the face. development of the mammalian face requires a large number of genes that are expressed with spatio-temporal specificity, and transcriptional regulation mediated by enhancers plays a key role in the precise control of gene expression. using chromatin immunoprecipitation for a histone marker of active enhancers, we generated a genome-wide map of candidate enhancers from the maxillary arch (primordium for the upper jaw) of mouse embryos. furthermore, we confirmed multiple novel craniofacial enhancers near the genes implicated in human palate defects through functional assays. we characterized in detail one of the enhancers (lhx8_enh1) located upstream of lhx8, a key regulatory gene for craniofacial development. lhx8_enh1 contained an evolutionarily conserved binding site for lymphoid enhancer factor/t-cell factor family proteins, which mediate the transcriptional regulation by the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. we demonstrated in vitro that wnt/β-catenin signaling was indeed essential for the expression of lhx8 in the maxillary arch cells and that lhx8_enh1 was a direct target of the wnt/β-catenin pathway. together, we uncovered a molecular mechanism for the regulation of lhx8, and we provided valuable resources for further investigation into the gene regulatory network of craniofacial development. developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. these regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. we find that histone h3k27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing h3k4me1 alone. this indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.
atp-sensitive k(+) (k(atp)) channels, composed of inward rectifier k(+) (kir)6.x and sulfonylurea receptor (sur)x subunits, are expressed on cellular plasma membranes. we demonstrate an essential role for sur2 subunits in trafficking k(atp) channels to an intracellular vesicular compartment. transfection of kir6.x/sur2 subunits into a variety of cell lines (including h9c2 cardiac cells and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells) resulted in trafficking to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. by contrast, sur1/kir6.x channels efficiently localized to the plasmalemma. the channel turnover rate was similar with sur1 or sur2, suggesting that the expression of kir6/sur2 proteins in lysosomes is not associated with increased degradation. surface labeling of hemagglutinin-tagged channels demonstrated that sur2-containing channels dynamically cycle between endosomal and plasmalemmal compartments. in addition, kir6.2 and sur2 subunits were found in both endosomal and sarcolemmal membrane fractions isolated from rat hearts. the balance of these k(atp) channel subunits shifted to the sarcolemmal membrane fraction after the induction of ischemia. the k(atp) channel current density was also increased in rat ventricular myocytes isolated from hearts rendered ischemic before cell isolation without corresponding changes in subunit mrna expression. we conclude that an intracellular pool of sur2-containing k(atp) channels exists that is derived by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. in cardiac myocytes, this pool can potentially play a cardioprotective role by serving as a reservoir for modulating surface k(atp) channel density under stress conditions, such as myocardial ischemia. the female myocardium, relative to that of the male, exhibits sustained resistance to ischaemic tissue injury, a phenomenon termed sex‐specific cardioprotection (ssc). ssc is dependent upon the sarcolemmal katp channel (sarckatp), and protein kinase c (pkc). here we investigate whether pkc‐mediated regulation of sarckatp concentration can explain this endogenous form of protection. hearts from male (m) and female (f) rats were langendorff‐perfused for 30 min prior to either regional ischaemia–reperfusion (i/r), or global ischaemia (gisc). for both protocols, pre‐ischaemic blockade of pkc was achieved by chelerythrine (chel) in male (m + c) and female (f + c) hearts. additional female hearts underwent sarckatp antagonism during i/r by hmr‐1098 (hmr), either alone or in combination with chel (hmr + chel). gisc hearts were fractionated to assess cellular distribution of pkcɛ and sarckatp. sex‐specific infarct resistance was apparent under control i/r (f, 23 ± 3%vs. m, 36 ± 4%, p < 0.05) and abolished by chel (f + c, 36 ± 3%). female infarct resistance was susceptible to sarckatp blockade (control, 16 ± 2%vs. hmr, 27 ± 3%), and pkc blockade had no additional effect (hmr + chel, 26 ± 2%). the prevalence of kir6.2 and sur2 was higher in the sarcolemmal fractions of females (kir6.2: f, 1.24 ± 0.07 vs. m, 1.02 ± 0.06; sur2: f, 3.16 ± 0.22 vs. m, 2.45 ± 0.09; ratio units), but normalized by chel (kir6.2: f, 1.06 ± 0.07 vs. m, 0.99 ± 0.06; sur2: f, 2.99 ± 0.09 vs. m, 2.82 ± 0.22, m; ratio units). phosphorylation of sarcolemmal pkcɛ was reduced by chel (p‐pkcɛ/pkcɛ: control, 0.43 ± 0.02; chel, 0.29 ± 0.01; p < 0.01). we conclude that pkc‐mediated regulation of sarckatp may account for the physiologically sustainable dependence of ssc upon both pkc and sarckatp, and that this regulation involves pkc‐permitted enrichment of the female sarcolemma with sarckatp. as such, the pkc‐sarckatp axis may represent a target for sustainable prophylactic induction of cardioprotection.
ocular perfusion pressure (opp) is not easily directly measurable, and the difference between blood pressure and intraocular pressure (iop) has been suggested as a simple surrogate of opp. we write in relation to publications in this journal and elsewhere that have reported a significant association between opp surrogates and glaucoma. we argue that these findings are based on incorrect interpretation of multivariable regression models, and that these simple surrogates cannot be used to examine the role of opp in glaucoma. we illustrate this by theoretically reviewing the interpretation of coefficients in multivariable regression models, and then demonstrating the issue using a simulated dataset. interpretation of regression coefficients is straightforward in univariable regression. as an example, consider the setting of a cross-sectional study. a univariable logistic regression model examining whether iop is associated with the prevalence of glaucoma would be as follows: purpose. to assess the distribution of the 24-hour intraocular pressure (iop) in subjects with primary openangle glaucoma (poag) in a population-based study in rural west bengal. methods. all untreated poag patients (n = 132) identified by a door to door survey in the hugli district of west bengal were invited to attend a follow-up study in which iop was tested with a goldmann applanation tonometer at 10 am, 1 pm, 4 pm, 7pm, 10 pm, 1 am, and 6 am. results. 72 subjects with untreated poag (72/132; 88.6%) attended the study. of them, 59 (83.0%) had a peak iop ≤ 21 mm hg. the peak iop (mean ± sd) was 16.4 ± 4.2 mm hg. peak iop occurred in early morning in approximately 78.5% of the subjects (6 am to 10 am), and the trough occurred during night time in 72.2% of the subjects (10 pm to 1 am). the 24-hour iop (mean ± sd) was 14.2 ± 4.4 mm hg and the mean fluctuation was 4.0 ± 6.8 mm hg (range, 2–11 mm hg). in the 32 persons with unilateral glaucoma, no significant differences were found in mean 24-hour iop, peak iop, trough iop, or iop fluctuation when comparing the glaucomatous eye with the non glaucomatous eye (p > 0.05). conclusions. twenty-four–hour iop was similar between glaucomatous and controls (contralateral nonglaucomatous) eyes suggesting that factors other than iop may play a role in the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in these eyes.
backgroundnext generation sequencing (ngs) is expected to lift molecular diagnostics in clinical oncology to the next level. it enables simultaneous identification of mutations in a patient tumor, after which targeted therapy may be assigned. this approach could improve patient survival and/or assist in controlling healthcare costs by offering expensive treatment to only those likely to benefit. however, ngs has yet to make its way into the clinic. health technology assessment can support the adoption and implementation of a novel technology, but at this early stage many of the required variables are still unknown.methodsscenario drafting and expert elicitation via a questionnaire were used to identify factors that may act as a barrier or facilitate adoption of ngs-based molecular diagnostics. attention was paid to predominantly elicit quantitative answers, allowing their use in future modelling of cost-effectiveness.resultsadequately informing patients and physicians, the latters’ opinion on clinical utility and underlying evidence as well as presenting sequencing results within a relevant timeframe may act as pivotal facilitators. reimbursement for ngs-based testing and accompanying therapies (both general and in case of off-label prescription) was found to be a potential barrier. competition on the market and demonstrating clinical utility may also be challenging. importantly, numerous quantitative values for variables related to each of these potential barriers/facilitators, such as such as desired panel characteristics, willingness to pay or the expected number of targets identified per person, were also elicited.conclusionswe have identified several factors that may either pose a barrier or facilitate the adoption of ngs in the clinic. we believe acting upon these findings, for instance by organizing educational events, advocating new ways of evidence generation and steering towards the most cost-effective solution, will accelerate the route from bench-to-bedside. moreover, due to the methodology of expert elicitation, this study provides parameters that can be incorporated in future cost-effectiveness modeling to steer the development of ngs gene panels towards the most optimal direction. purpose dramatic advances in genomic technology stand to revolutionize cancer care; however, little is known about patients' understanding and acceptance of personalized medicine and widespread genetic testing (gt).   patients and methods we conducted a formative, semi-structured interview study with a random sample of patients with lung, colorectal, and breast cancers to assess awareness of personalized medicine and gt and attitudes about somatic gt. willingness to undergo gt was elicited through hypothetic scenarios.   results sixty-nine patients participated; 71% were women; 42% were black; median age was 59 years; and 42% had an education level ≥ college. we found that a majority of patients either were not aware of the term "personalized medicine" or defined it in unexpected ways. although many patients identified relevant benefits of somatic testing (eg, informs treatment), many patients also expressed significant concerns (ie, psychological harm and discrimination). a majority of patients expressed a willingness to undergo somatic (predictive, 96%, prognostic, 93%) and germline (cancer risk without incidental information, 87%; cancer risk with incidental information, 81%; pharmacogenetic, 91%) testing; however, far fewer patients expressed a willingness to undergo full genome sequencing (62%). reluctance was attributed to concerns over incidental findings, information overload, and the lack of a clear benefit.   conclusion many patients relayed misunderstandings about somatic testing and a reluctance to undergo full sequencing; oncologists must carefully consider how they present testing to patients so that concerns over discrimination and psychological harm do not hinder test uptake. more work is needed to identify effective ways to communicate complex genomic concepts to patients and research participants.
great cormorants (phalacrocorax carbo) are piscivorous birds, and as apex predators they accumulate high levels of contaminants from the aquatic ecosystems. in the present study, we analyzed distribution of al, cd, cr, cu, fe, hg, mn, ni, pb, sr, and zn in ten tissues (muscle, liver, kidney, spleen, gizzard, heart, skin, lard, breast feathers, and remiges) of the great cormorants in the marin sprud locality, the danube river, serbia. concentrations of elements in tissues were assessed by using inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry. linear discriminant analysis indicates that breast feathers and remiges have a high bioaccumulation potential for heavy metals (cr, pb, sr, and zn). those tissues had the highest concentrations of lead (pb) (2.179 ± 0.742; 0628 ± 0.282). maximum concentrations of mercury (hg) were detected in liver (30.673 ± 14.081), followed by kidney, for the same element (17.409 ± 5.676), respectively. the overall maximum metal accumulation was observed in breast feathers and remiges, followed by liver and kidney, whereas the minimum values were observed in muscle, skin, and lard. the greatest concentrations of cr, ni, pb, sr, zn, and al were detected in feather tissues. our study confirms that great cormorant is a good indicator species for monitoring of pollution of river and wetland ecosystems. total mercury levels in different feather types (down, contour, tail and flight) in great cormorants (phalacrocorax carbo l.) were determined using cv-aas. feathers from great cormorants inhabiting the vistula lagoon ecosystem have an average hg level of 7.14 ± 3.99 (μg/g w.w.). age-dependent concentrations of hg were statistically significant (anova kruskal–wallis, p < 0.0001). there were also significant differences in hg levels in different parts of feathers from adults and immature birds (anova kruskal–wallis, p < 0.0001). cormorant chick feathers appear to be a potential biomonitor of hg pollution in the vistula lagoon ecosystem, but this subject requires further research.
eleven known cases of bioterrorism-related inhalational anthrax (ia) were treated in the united states during 2001. we retrospectively compared 2 methods that have been proposed to screen for ia. the 2 screening protocols for ia were applied to the emergency department charts of patients who presented with possible signs or symptoms of ia at inova fairfax hospital (falls church, virginia) from 20 october 2001 through 3 november 2001. the mayer criteria would have screened 4 patients (0.4%; 95% ci, 0.1%-0.9%) and generated charges of 1900 dollars. if 29 patients (2.6%; 95% ci, 1.7%-3.7%) with >or=5 symptoms (but without fever and tachycardia) were screened, charges were 13,325 dollars. the hupert criteria would have screened 273 patients (24%; 95% ci, 22%-27%) and generated charges of 126,025 dollars. in this outbreak of bioterrorism-related ia, applying the mayer criteria would have identified both patients with ia and would have generated fewer charges than applying the hupert criteria. context in the event of a bioterrorist attack, it may be difficult to distinguish inhalational anthrax from viral respiratory tract disease. contribution this synthesis compares reported symptoms of 28 patients with inhalational anthrax and 4694 patients with viral respiratory tract illnesses. fever and cough were common in both infections. mental confusion or loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, and nausea and vomiting more often indicated anthrax, whereas sore throat and runny nose more often indicated viral infection. implications several symptoms, including neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms and shortness of breath, may help distinguish inhalational anthrax from respiratory viral illness. the editors the 2001 anthrax attacks in the united states, in which 11 people developed the inhalational form of the disease and 5 died, exposed a weakness in the u.s. medical response to bioterrorism (1). despite heroic efforts on behalf of the victims, physicians were largely unprepared to recognize the early symptoms and signs of this extremely rare and rapidly progressive infection in ambulatory patients (2). initially, 4 of the 11 patients were sent home after being seen as outpatients or in an emergency department with diagnoses that included viral syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis (3, 4). physicians first considered a diagnosis of anthrax in 2 of these patients (both postal workers) on their second visits to the emergency department and then only after hearing media reports of illness among other postal employees (3). inhalation of anthrax spores leads to clinical disease from elaboration of two toxins, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase known as edema factor and a zinc metalloproteinase called lethal factor, by phagocytosed bacteria in the mediastinal lymph nodes and bloodstream (5). classic pathologic findings include hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis; primary anthrax pneumonia is rare (6, 7). without prompt treatment, death occurs rapidly from a combination of shock and respiratory compromise. anthrax has been classified by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention as one of six category a bioterrorist agents posing the greatest risk to civilian populations (8). a large-scale anthrax attack has the potential to cause casualties on a scale that would quickly overwhelm local and regional health care treatment capacity (6). the emergency response to such an attack would probably include the establishment of multiple mass prophylaxis centers physically distinct from hospital emergency departments (to prevent overcrowding and potential contamination) for rapid dispensing of prophylactic antibiotics to exposed populations and for identifying individuals suspected of having inhalational anthrax (9). presumptive cases would be transferred to established or temporary medical care facilities for rapid definitive testing and initiation of combination antimicrobial treatment, which may improve outcomes (10-12). efficient management of this limited medical care capacity is an important secondary goal of outpatient triage during a bioterrorism response (13, 14). screening and triage protocols used in these settings would need to rely on presenting symptoms and signs because laboratory or radiographic testing will probably not be feasible in high-volume mass prophylaxis centers (15). we sought to establish an evidence base for developing a screening protocol for inhalational anthrax. the utility of such a protocol, which improves both case detection and case exclusion, would also extend beyond the immediate mass prophylaxis setting because large numbers of individuals outside the exposure zone will probably seek reassurance from health care providers for symptomatic illnesses in the aftermath of a major attack. providing scientific evidence on which to base these discussions may decrease postattack anxiety and inappropriate utilization of health care resources (16). methods clinical data on the 11 inhalational anthrax cases of 2001 are now widely available (3, 4, 17-20). because of the small number of cases in the contemporary attack, we performed a systematic literature review to identify additional original case reports of inhalational anthrax in the english-language medical literature. we searched two computerized databases (medline and web of science) for adult human case reports of anthrax infection between 1960 and 2000 using the keywords anthrax and case report. this yielded 44 references; 4 contained sufficient clinical data on inhalational anthrax to permit comparison with the 11 contemporary cases (21-24). tracing bibliographies of these articles and a recent review article (25) produced an additional 7 articles that were appropriate for inclusion, for a total of 11 reports on 17 cases (26-32). two of the cases involved patients from outside of the united states (22, 24). we interpreted lack of mention of a specific symptom or abnormal sign in these reports as indicating the absence of that finding from the patient's clinical presentation. we compared proportions of symptoms and signs in historical and contemporary cases using the fisher exact test; clinical features that had consistent prevalence rates in earlier and contemporary cases were candidates for comparison with viral respiratory tract disease. viral respiratory tract infections, such as with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses or coronaviruses, are appropriate comparison conditions for this study because of their prevalence and potential similarity to inhalational anthrax (15, 33). we searched medline for descriptive epidemiologic reports of presenting clinical features of laboratory-confirmed influenza and noninfluenza viral respiratory illnesses in ambulatory adults; we found five published studies that met the search criteria (34-38). we did not include studies that describe samples of mixed influenza and noninfluenza cases (39-42) or that present data already reported in these five studies (43). we did not compare anthrax cases with asymptomatic persons (because they would not present a screening dilemma) or with acutely ill patients (because they would probably not participate in mass screening). since there are no reports of inhalational anthrax in pediatric patients, we limited our comparison sample to adult patients. finally, we also compared anthrax cases to ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia to highlight the difficulty of distinguishing these two conditions (44). we calculated positive likelihood ratios with 95% cis for the presence of selected signs and symptoms in inhalational anthrax versus influenza, influenza-like illness, and ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia. the positive likelihood ratio is defined here as the prevalence of a symptom or sign among inhalational anthrax cases divided by the prevalence of the same symptom or sign in the influenza, influenza-like illness, or pneumonia comparison groups. the positive likelihood ratio is the multiplicative factor that increases or decreases the odds of having inhalational anthrax as opposed to one of these comparison diseases, given the presence of a clinical finding (45). therefore, the post-test probability of having inhalational anthrax is influenced by both the magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio and the pretest probability of having the disease (46). in the appropriate clinical setting (that is, when the pretest probability of having the target disease is not zero), likelihood ratios greater than 3 or less than 0.3 are considered clinically important (47). the general approach used heredeveloping diagnostic algorithms for rare diagnoses by using likelihood ratios and by establishing hypothetical comparison groups populated by common medical conditionshas been previously described (46, 48, 49). the study sponsors had no role in the design, conduct, and reporting of the data or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. results presenting symptoms and signs and radiographic results for the 11 deliberately infected contemporary cases and 17 occupationally or environmentally infected historical cases were similar, although contemporary patients reported significantly more fever/chills and fatigue or malaise (table 1). all but 1 of the 28 patients (including 100% of the contemporary patients) had fever, chills, or cough on presentation. (the single exception was a patient who presented with impending shock, which limited the ability to record a complete history.) other symptoms that affected more than half of all patients included dyspnea (68%), chest discomfort or pain (61%), and nausea or vomiting (61%). more than half of current case-patients and 43% of the combined sample presented with neurologic symptoms other than headache, including confusion, blurred vision, and dizziness. only a few patients with inhalational anthrax reported sore throat (18%) or rhinorrhea (14%). table 1. summary of symptoms and signs at initial presentation: historical versus contemporary patients with inhalational anthrax eighty-one percent of patients presented with abnormalities on lung auscultation, including rales or rhonchi (65%) and dullness or decreased breath sounds (58%). respiratory symptoms often did not match findings on lung physical examination. four of the five patients with no respiratory symptoms had positive findings (rales), whereas 8 of the 23 patients with respiratory symptoms had no abnormality on lung examination. outcomes differed significantly between historical and contemporary patients: 16 of the 17 historical patients died compared with only 5 of the 11 contemporary patients. the presenting clinical features of the 28 patients can be divided into nine symptom complexes involving respiratory; gastrointestinal; ear, nose, and throat; and nonheadache neurologic problems (figure 1). the single most common presentation was a combination of respirato
abstract the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 on the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein e-knockout (apoe−/−) mice. eight-week-old apoe−/− mice were fed a western diet with or without l. acidophilus atcc 4356 daily for 16 weeks. l. acidophilus atcc 4356 protected apoe−/− mice from atherosclerosis by reducing their plasma cholesterol levels from 923 ± 44 to 581 ± 18 mg/dl, likely via a marked decrease in cholesterol absorption caused by modulation of niemann-pick c1-like 1 (npc1l1). in addition, suppression of cholesterol absorption induced reverse cholesterol transport (rct) in macrophages through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/liver x receptor (ppar/lxr) pathway. fecal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium counts were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the l. acidophilus atcc 4356 treatment groups than in the control groups. furthermore, l. acidophilus atcc 4356 was detected in the rat small intestine, colon, and feces during the feeding trial. the bacterial levels remained high even after the administration of lactic acid bacteria had been stopped for 2 weeks. these results suggest that administration of l. acidophilus atcc 4356 can protect against atherosclerosis through the inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption. therefore, l. acidophilus atcc 4356 may be a potential therapeutic material for preventing the progression of atherosclerosis. the main aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 synbiotic diets: 1) containing lactobacillus casei ascc 292 and fructooligosaccharides (lf diet); 2) containing l. casei ascc 292 and maltodextrin (lm diet); and 3) containing l. casei ascc 292, fructooligosaccharide, and maltodextrin (lfm diet) to reduce serum cholesterol in male wistar rats. the effect of the synbiotic diets on intestinal microflora, concentration of organic acids, and the possibility of translocation of lactobacilli were also investigated. the lfm diet lowered serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, whereas the lm diet increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. however, synbiotic diets did not contribute to a change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level compared with the control diet. there was a decrease in the population of staphylococci, bacteroides, escherichia coli, and total coliforms in most bowel regions with the lfm diet compared with the control (which did not contain any synbiotic). in general, the lfm diet contributed to a higher concentration of lactic acid that may have contributed to the decrease in the population of pathogenic microorganisms compared with the control. fructooligosaccharide was the preferred substrate for production of acetic acid. results from this study showed that the synbiotic diet that contained l. casei ascc 292, fructooligosaccharide, and maltodextrin beneficially altered cholesterol levels and produced a healthier bowel microbial population without translocation of lactobacilli to other organs.
we found a bacterium, pandoraea sp. 12b-2, of which whole cells catalyzed not only the decarboxylation of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate but also the regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene to 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate. the whole cells of pandoraea sp. 12b-2 also catalyzed the regioselective carboxylation of phenol and 1,2-dihydroxybenzene to 4-hydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, respectively. the molar conversion ratio of the carboxylation reaction depended on the concentration of khco3 in the reaction mixture. only 5 or 48 % of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene added was converted into 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate in the presence of 0.1 m or 3 m khco3, respectively. the addition of acetone to the reaction mixture increased the initial rate of the carboxylation reaction, but the final molar conversion yield reached almost the same value. when the efficient production of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate was optimized using the whole cells of pandoraea sp. 12b-2, the productivity of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate topped out at 1.43 m, which was the highest value so far reported. no formation of any other products was observed after the carboxylation reaction. a nonoxidative decarboxylase, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, was found in agrobacterium tumefaciens iam12048. the enzyme activity was induced specifically by 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate. the purified enzyme was a homotetramer of identical 38 kda subunits. the purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. in the presence of khco3, the enzyme also catalyzed the regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene into 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate at a molar conversion ratio of 30%.
the relationship between obesity and cancer screening varies by screening test, race, and gender. most studies on cervical cancer screening found a negative association between increasing weight and screening, and this negative association was most consistent in white women. recent literature on mammography reports no association with weight. however, some studies show a negative association in white, but not black, women. in contrast, obese/overweight men reported higher rates of prostate-specific antigen (psa) testing. comparison of prostate cancer screening, mammography, and pap smears implies a gender difference in the relationship between screening behavior and weight. in colorectal cancer (crc) screening, the relationship between weight and screening in men is inconsistent, while there is a trend towards lower crc screening in higher weight women. background obesity is associated with increased colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. previous studies using telephone survey data showed that obese women were less likely to receive colorectal cancer screening. it is unknown if this is true among patients in primary care practices.   methods retrospective chart reviews were conducted in 2003-2004 of men and women in 22 suburban new jersey and pennsylvania primary care practices. data from patients age 50 years and over (n=1297) were analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression. the outcome measure was receipt of colorectal cancer screening (fecal occult blood test within 1 year, sigmoidoscopy within 5 years, colonoscopy within 10 years, or barium enema within 5 years) among obese and non-obese patients.   results overall, 39% of patients were obese and 29% received colorectal cancer screening. after controlling for age, gender, total number of co-morbidities, number of visits in the past 2 years, and number of years in the practice, obese patients had 25% decreased odds of being screened for colorectal cancer compared to non-obese patients (or 0.75, 95% ci, 0.62-0.91). the relationship of obesity and colorectal cancer screening did not differ according to gender. number of visits (or 1.04, 95% ci, 1.01-1.06) and male gender (or 1.53, 95% ci, 1.19-1.97) was associated with increased odds of receiving colorectal cancer screening.   conclusion identification of physician and patient barriers to colorectal cancer screening is needed, particularly in obese patients, so that effective interventions may be developed to increase screening in this high-risk group.
abstract:  the purpose of this study was to establish normal physiologic reference values for intraocular pressure (iop) and schirmer tear test (stt) results in clinically normal ostriches (struthio camelus). twenty ostriches of both sexes, 10 juveniles (1.5–2 yr of age) and 10 adults, were included in this study. complete ophthalmic examination was performed prior to this investigation. stt was performed by inserting a standard sterile stt strip over the ventral lid margin into the ventral conjunctival sac for 60 sec. following the stt, iop was measured using applanation tonometry with the tono-pen vet™ tonometer after topical instillation of one drop of 0.5% proparacaine ophthalmic solution. the mean ± sd and range of tono-pen readings of iop for all birds was 18.8 ± 3.5, with a range of 12–24. mean iop in juvenile ostriches was 19.7 ± 3.6. mean iop in adult ostriches was 16.9 ± 2.9. there was no statistically significant difference between young and adult birds (p = 0.07). the mean stt values in the present study were 16.3 ± 2.5 mm/1 min when measurements from both eyes were averaged. mean stt in juvenile and adult ostriches was 15.4 ± 1.8 and 17.2 ± 2.9 mm/1 min, respectively. there was no statistically significant difference between young and adult birds (p = 0.11). no statistically significant differences between genders were found for any of the results (p ≥ 0.41). in conclusion, this study provides normal reference range values for stt and iop in clinically healthy ostriches. objective to examine the feasibility and accuracy of a handheld rebound tonometer, tonovet, and to compare the intraocular pressure (iop) readings of the tonovet with those of an applanation tonometer, tonopen xl, in normal eurasian eagle owls.   animals studied ten clinically normal eurasian eagle owls (20 eyes).   procedures complete ocular examinations, using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy, were conducted on each raptor. the iop was measured bilaterally using a rebound tonometer followed by a topical anesthetic agent after 1 min. the tonopen xl tonometer was applied in both eyes 30 s following topical anesthesia.   results the mean +/- sd iop obtained by rebound tonometer was 10.45 +/- 1.64 mmhg (range 7-14 mmhg), and by applanation tonometer was 9.35 +/- 1.81 mmhg (range 6-12 mmhg). there was a significant difference (p = 0.001) in the iop obtained from both tonometers. the linear regression equation describing the relationship between both devices was y = 0.669x + 4.194 (x = tonopen xl and y = tonovet). the determination coefficient (r(2)) was r(2) = 0.550.   conclusions the results suggest that readings from the rebound tonometer significantly overestimated those from the applanation tonometer and that the rebound tonometer was tolerated well because of the rapid and minimal stress-inducing method of tonometry in the eurasian eagle owls, even without topical anesthesia. further studies comparing tonovet with manometric measurements may be necessary to employ rebound tonometer for routine clinical use in eurasian eagle owls.
the aims of this cross-sectional study were (i) to compare the overall glucose metabolism between early onset and late onset alzheimer's disease in a large sample of patients; and (ii) to investigate the pattern of glucose metabolism as a function of dementia severity in early onset versus late onset alzheimer's disease, using a statistical parametric mapping (spm) analysis. subjects consisted of four groups: 74 patients with early onset alzheimer's disease, 46 patients with late onset of the disease, and two control groups age matched to each patient group. all the subjects underwent 2-[(18)f]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (fdg)-pet under the same scanning conditions. severity of dementia was rated with the clincial dementia rating (cdr). voxel-based spm99 was used for statistical analyses. overall glucose hypometabolism of early onset alzheimer's disease patients was much greater in magnitude and extent than that of late onset patients, though both groups were similar in dementia severity: the early onset group showed more severe hypometabolism in parietal, frontal and subcortical (basal ganglia and thalamus) areas. when the decline of glucose metabolism was compared as a function of cdr stage, the slope was steeper in early onset than in late onset alzheimer's disease. the rapid decline occurred at cdr 0.5-1 in the early onset group, whereas similar changes occurred at cdr 2-3 in the late onset group. the greater hypometabolism in early onset than in late onset patients is required to reach the same severity of dementia, probably reflecting greater functional reserve in younger than in older subjects. alternatively, the metabolic decline curve suggests that the early onset patients may take a more rapid course in the reduction of glucose metabolism than the late onset patients. objective: to compare the hmpao spect cerebral perfusion patterns in early and late onset alzheimer’s disease. methods: twenty patients with early onset disease (<65 years) and 44 patients with late onset disease (>65 years) were studied. all patients fulfilled nincds-adrda clinical criteria and had details of disease severity and length of history at the time of imaging. technetium-99m hmpao spect brain scans were acquired on a multi-detector gammacamera and analysed visually and with statistical parametric mapping (spm99). results: patients with early onset disease had significantly greater posterior cortical association area involvement whereas those with late onset disease had significantly greater medial temporal hypoperfusion. these findings were unchanged after controlling for disease severity and length of illness. discussion: these functional imaging findings of the differences between early and late onset alzheimer’s disease are supported by published findings that include histopathological and clinical evidence; namely late onset patients tend to present with the characteristic involvement of the medial temporal lobes producing marked memory loss whereas early onset patients present with predominant posterior cortical association area involvement. these age related findings should be borne in mind when clinically diagnosing, and interpreting functional brain imaging studies in, patients with suspected alzheimer’s disease.
liver disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the spectrum of the disease ranged from fatty liver to hepatic inflammation, necrosis, progressive fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. we evaluated the serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1, total b-hexosaminidase and its isoenzymes hex a and b activities, and nitric oxide in patients with liver diseases and their association with aminotransferase level. seventy patients and 12 healthy subjects were recruited. patients were divided into three groups: chronic hepatitis group (20 patients), liver cirrhosis group (30 patients), and malignant liver group (20 patients). serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1, total b-hexosaminidase and its isoenzymes hex a and b activities, and nitric oxide were measured. serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1, total b-hexosaminidase activity, and nitric oxide were significantly higher in the liver disease patients. serum levels of isoenzymes hex a and b were significantly higher in malignant liver patients. total b-hexosaminidase and its isoenzyme hex a activity levels were significantly higher in positive hbsag and positive anti-hcv patients. serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 were positively correlated with aminotransferase level. taken together, these findings suggested that these biochemical indices might reflect ongoing disease activity and played an important role in the pathophysiology of liver diseases. liver cirrhosis is a risk factor for osteoporosis. nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms of bone mass loss in patients with viral cirrhosis. tnfalpha is a potent bone-resorbing agent. serum concentrations of soluble tnf receptor p55 (stnfr-55) correlate with clinical activity in liver cirrhosis. our aim was to evaluate the possible role of stnfr-55 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in patients with viral cirrhosis and its relationship with bone turnover markers. we studied 40 consecutive patients with viral cirrhosis and no history of alcohol intake and 26 healthy volunteers. bone mineral density (bmd) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine (ls) and femoral neck (fn). patients with viral cirrhosis had reduced bmd (expressed as the z-score) in all sites [ls, -1.5 +/- 0.22 (p < 0.001); fn, -0.37 +/- 0.15 (p < 0.01)]. serum concentrations of stnfr-55 and urinary deoxypyridinoline, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, were significantly higher in patients with osteoporosis than in patients without osteoporosis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). serum levels of stnfr-55 correlated inversely with bmd in ls (r = -0.62; p < 0.005) and fn (r = -0.47; p < 0.05) and positively with urinary deoxypyridinoline (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). our findings show that high serum concentrations of stnfr-55 play a role in the pathogenesis of viral cirrhosis-associated bone mass loss and provide evidence of increased bone resorption related to the high serum stnfr-55 levels.
privacy is a major concern for the design and user acceptance of pervasive technology. investigating privacy poses several methodological challenges. a popular approach involves surveying reactions of people to scenarios that highlight privacy issues. this paper examines the validity of this approach. it reports an experiment that compared people's ability to correctly judge compliance to privacy principles when scenarios are presented in video versus textual form. it was found that such privacy-related concepts are hard to understand, leading to a large number of erroneous judgments regardless of medium and that interpretation varied across media. comprehension in such studies can be improved, if a text scenario is preceded by a video-based version. studies have repeatedly shown that users are increasingly concerned about their privacy when they go online. in response to both public interest and regulatory pressures, privacy policies have become almost ubiquitous. an estimated 77% of websites now post a privacy policy. these policies differ greatly from site to site, and often address issues that are different from those that users care about. they are in most cases the users' only source of information.this paper evaluates the usability of online privacy policies, as well as the practice of posting them. we analyze 64 current privacy policies, their accessibility, writing, content and evolution over time. we examine how well these policies meet user needs and how they can be improved. we determine that significant changes need to be made to current practice to meet regulatory and usability requirements.
the current study investigated the roles of various subtypes of opioid receptors expressed in the thalamic nucleus submedius (sm) in inhibition of mirror-image allodynia induced by l5/l6 spinal nerve ligation in rats. morphine was microinjected into the sm, which produced a dose-dependent inhibition of mirror-image allodynia; this effect was antagonized by pretreatment with non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. microinjections of endomorphin-1 (μ-receptor agonist), or [d-ala2, d-leu5]-enkephalin (dadle, δ-/μ-receptor agonist), also inhibited mirror-image allodynia, and these effects were blocked by the selective μ-receptor antagonist, β-funaltrexamine hydrochloride. the dadle-induced inhibition, however, was not influenced by the δ-receptor antagonist naltrindole. the κ-receptor agonist, spiradoline mesylate salt, failed to alter the mirror-image allodynia. these results suggest that sm opioid receptor signaling is involved in inhibition of mirror-image allodynia; this effect is mediated by μ- (but not δ- and κ-) opioid receptors in the rat model of neuropathic pain. previous studies have indicated that thalamic nucleus submedius is involved in opioid-mediated antinociception in tail flick test and formalin test. the current study examined the effects of opioids microinjected into the thalamic nucleus submedius on the allodynia developed in neuropathic pain model rats, and determined the roles of different subtypes of opioid receptors in the thalamic nucleus submedius opioid-evoked antiallodynia. the allodynic behaviors induced by l5/l6 spinal nerve ligation were assessed by mechanical (von frey filaments) and cold (4 degrees c plate) stimuli. morphine (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 microg) microinjected into the thalamic nucleus submedius contralateral to the nerve injury paw produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the mechanical and cold allodynia, and these effects were reversed by microinjection of the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1.0 microg) into the same site. microinjection of endomorphin-1 (5.0 microg), a highly selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, and [d-ala2, d-leu5]-enkephalin (10 microg), a delta-/mu-opioid receptor agonist, also inhibited the allodynic behaviors, and these effects were blocked by selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine hydrochloride (3.75 microg). however, the [d-ala2, d-leu5]-enkephalin-evoked antiallodynic effects were not influenced by the selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (5.0 microg). microinjection of the selective kappa-receptor agonist spiradoline mesylate salt (100 microg) into the thalamic nucleus submedius failed to alter the allodynia induced by spinal nerve ligation. these results suggest that the thalamic nucleus submedius is involved in opioid-evoked antiallodynia which is mediated by mu- but not delta- and kappa-opioid receptor in the neuropathic pain model rats.
an e3 ligase prt6 mutant with constitutive expression of hypoxic genes confers tolerance against submergence via sugar conservation as well as resistance to starvation. plants respond to reductions in internal oxygen concentrations with adaptive mechanisms (for example, modifications of metabolism to cope with reduced supply of atp). these responses are, at the transcriptional level, mediated by the group vii ethylene response factor transcription factors, which have stability that is regulated by the n-end rule pathway of protein degradation. n-end rule pathway mutants are characterized by a constitutive expression of hypoxia response genes and abscisic acid hypersensitivity. here, we identify a novel proteolysis6 (prt6) mutant allele, named greening after extended darkness1 (ged1), which was previously discovered in a screen for genomes uncoupled-like mutants and shows the ability to withstand long periods of darkness at the seedling stage. interestingly, this ethyl methanesulfonate-derived mutant shows unusual chromosomal rearrangement instead of a point mutation. furthermore, the sensitivity of n-end rule pathway mutants ged1 and prt6-1 to submergence was studied in more detail to understand previously contradicting experiments on this topic. finally, it was shown that mutants for the n-end rule pathway are generally more tolerant to starvation conditions, such as prolonged darkness or submergence, which was partially associated with carbohydrate conservation. in plant and animal cells, amino-terminal cysteine oxidation controls selective proteolysis via an oxygen-dependent branch of the n-end rule pathway. it remains unknown how the n-terminal cysteine is specifically oxidized. here we identify plant cysteine oxidase (pco) enzymes that oxidize the penultimate cysteine of erf-vii transcription factors by using oxygen as a co-substrate, thereby controlling the lifetime of these proteins. consequently, erf-vii proteins are stabilized under hypoxia and activate the molecular response to low oxygen while the expression of anaerobic genes is repressed in air. members of the pco family are themselves targets of erf-vii transcription factors, generating a feedback loop that adapts the stress response according to the extent of the hypoxic condition. our results reveal that pcos act as sensor proteins for oxygen in plants and provide an example of how proactive regulation of the n-end rule pathway balances stress response to optimal growth and development in plants.
recognition memory was assessed by submitting the same adult monkeys to visual paired comparison (vpc) with mixed delays (10-120 sec), followed by three consecutive versions of object-delayed nonmatching-to-sample (dnms): increasing delays (10-600 sec), lengthened lists (3-10 objects), and intervening distractors in the delays (light at 10 sec, motor task at 30-600 sec, or context change at 600 sec). four groups were tested: normal controls, monkeys with ibotenic acid lesions of the hippocampal formation (h), and monkeys with aspiration lesions of either the perirhinal (prh) or parahippocampal (areas th/tf) cortex. group h was impaired on vpc at delays ≥60 sec but had difficulty on dnms only at 600 sec delays with distraction. in group th/tf, the vpc impairment emerged earlier (30 sec); yet, once the nonmatching rule was mastered, no significant change occurred on any dnms condition. only group prh behaved congruently on vpc and dnms, exhibiting a deficit at the easiest condition that worsened with increasing delays as well as in dnms lengthened list and distraction conditions. these results led us to postulate that vpc and dnms, as previously administered to monkeys, were not equivalent visual recognition memory probes. specifically, we propose that, for vpc, because of passive (incidental) encoding, the animal's performance rests on both item familiarity and event recollection, whereas, for dnms, because of active (purposeful) encoding, performance relies more on item familiarity. this proposal converges with current models postulating distinct, but interactive, mnemonic roles for the hippocampal and adjacent th/tf regions. monkeys in whom the fornix had been transected and controls were trained on two versions of delayed non-matching to sample (dnms). on dnms-lss the stimulus pair for each trial was selected from a large set of junk objects so that the animals saw particular stimuli infrequently. on dnms-rs the same two stimuli were presented repeatedly. memory for the sample was assessed with retention intervals of 10, 70 and 130 sec spent either in the dark or with levels of illumination designed to promote interference effects. on dnms-lss the lesioned animals were impaired, being more susceptible than controls to increases in the retention interval. however, neither group was particularly sensitive to interference. in contrast, on dnms-rs the lesioned monkeys were unimpaired, both groups showing a marked decrement in performance with increasing retention interval and a high sensitivity to the effects of interference. these data suggest that monkeys possess a short-term memory which is intact after transection of the fornix and a long-term memory which is not.
background chest pain is a frequent chief complaint among the pediatric population. to date, limited data exist on the full spectrum of emergent cardiac disease among such patients; and existing data have been limited to relatively small cohorts.   objectives the aims of the study were to investigate the emergent cardiac etiologies of chest pain in a large cohort of patients presenting to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department (ped) and to examine the use of resources (electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, echocardiogram, and laboratories) in those with and without cardiac-related chest pain.   methods patient visits to 2 tertiary care peds were evaluated over a 3 and half-year period. records of patients less than 19 years of age with a chief complaint of chest pain and no history of cardiovascular disease were reviewed. patients were categorized as having cardiac or noncardiac etiologies or history of cardiovascular disease at the time of discharge, based on ped attending's final diagnoses. final diagnoses classified as emergent cardiac etiologies were determined a priori.   results four thousand four hundred thirty-six patients reported a chief complaint of chest pain during the study period. three percent were excluded secondary to a history of heart disease. only 24 (0.6%) of the remaining 4288 were determined to have chest pain of cardiac origin. those with cardiac-related chest pain had a rate of admission of 50% compared to those without cardiac disease at 4% (p < .001). nine patients had an arrhythmia, 6 had pericarditis, 4 had myocarditis, 3 had acute myocardial infarction, and 1 had pulmonary embolism and pneumopericardium. ninety-two percent of the cardiac-related chest pain cohort received electrocardiograms compared to those without cardiac-related chest pain at 27% (p < .01). only 1 (4%) of 24 subjects with cardiac-related chest pain had a prior emergency department visit within 72 hours suggesting a high detection rate upon initial presentation. the most common noncardiac etiologies for the chest pain were 56% musculoskeletal disorders; 12% related to wheezing, asthma, and cough; 8% infectious causes; 6% gastrointestinal; and 4% related to sickle cell anemia.   conclusion cardiac-related chest pain in pediatric patients is rare but potentially serious. arrhythmia was the most common cardiac-related etiology among this cohort. those with myocarditis and myocardial infarction were the most acutely ill. an electrocardiogram in addition to history and physical examination was most useful in detecting relatively uncommon but significant cardiac-related chest pain. using a thorough physical examination and potentially an electrocardiogram evaluation by a pediatric emergency care physician has an excellent rate of detection of cardiac-related causes. childhood chest pain is a common complaint and often a recurrent, chronic symptom. a detailed history and complete physical examination are the most important aspects of evaluating a child with chest pain. childhood chest pain has a good prognosis. laboratory tests should only be ordered if they are indicated on the basis of history and physical examination findings.
the widespread distribution of lentiviruses among african primates, and the lack of severe pathogenesis in many of these natural reservoirs, are taken as evidence for long-term co-evolution between the simian immunodeficiency viruses (sivs) and their primate hosts. evidence for positive selection acting on antiviral restriction factors is consistent with virus-host interactions spanning millions of years of primate evolution. however, many restriction mechanisms are not virus-specific, and selection cannot be unambiguously attributed to any one type of virus. we hypothesized that the restriction factor trim5, because of its unique specificity for retrovirus capsids, should accumulate adaptive changes in a virus-specific fashion, and therefore, that phylogenetic reconstruction of trim5 evolution in african primates should reveal selection by lentiviruses closely related to modern sivs. we analyzed complete trim5 coding sequences of 22 old world primates and identified a tightly-spaced cluster of branch-specific adaptions appearing in the cercopithecinae lineage after divergence from the colobinae around 16 million years ago. functional assays of both extant trim5 orthologs and reconstructed ancestral trim5 proteins revealed that this cluster of adaptations in trim5 specifically resulted in the ability to restrict cercopithecine lentiviruses, but had no effect (positive or negative) on restriction of other retroviruses, including lentiviruses of non-cercopithecine primates. the correlation between lineage-specific adaptations and ability to restrict viruses endemic to the same hosts supports the hypothesis that lentiviruses closely related to modern sivs were present in africa and infecting the ancestors of cercopithecine primates as far back as 16 million years ago, and provides insight into the evolution of trim5 specificity. after entry into target cells, retroviruses encounter the host restriction factors such as fv1 and trim5α. while it is clear that these factors target retrovirus capsid proteins (ca), recognition remains poorly defined in the absence of structural information. to better understand the binding interaction between trim5α and ca, we selected a panel of novel n-tropic murine leukaemia virus (n-mlv) escape mutants by a serial passage of replication competent n-mlv in rhesus macaque trim5α (rhtrim5α)-positive cells using a small percentage of unrestricted cells to allow multiple rounds of virus replication. the newly identified mutations, many of which involve changes in charge, are distributed over the outer ‘top’ surface of n-mlv ca, including the n-terminal β-hairpin, and map up to 29 ao apart. biological characterisation with a number of restriction factors revealed that only one of the new mutations affects restriction by human trim5α, indicating significant differences in the binding interaction between n-mlv and the two trim5αs, whereas three of the mutations result in dual sensitivity to fv1n and fv1b. structural studies of two mutants show that no major changes in the overall ca conformation are associated with escape from restriction. we conclude that interactions involving much, if not all, of the surface of ca are vital for trim5α binding.
the aim of this study was to determine the incidence of tetracycline resistance and the prevalence of tetracycline-resistance genes in strains of clostridium perfringens isolated from different sources between 1994 and 2005. susceptibility to tetracycline and minocycline in strains from humans (35 isolates), chickens (15 isolates), food (21 isolates), soil (16 isolates) and veterinary sources (6 isolates) was determined, and tetracycline-resistance genes were detected. resistance was most common in strains isolated from chickens, followed by those from soils, clinical samples and foods. the most highly resistant strains were found among clinical and food isolates. teta(p) was the most common resistance gene, and along with tetb(p) was found in all resistant strains and some sensitive strains. one tetracycline-resistant food isolate had an intact tet(m) gene. however, pcr fragments of 0.4 or 0.8 kb with high degrees of identity to parts of the tet(m) sequences of other bacteria were found, mainly in clinical isolates, and often in isolates with tetb(p). no correlation between level of sensitivity to tetracycline or minocycline and the presence of teta(p), tetb(p) or part of tet(m) was found. the presence of part of tet(m) in some strains of c. perfringens containing tetb(p) may have occurred by recent gene transfer. aims:  to determine if environmental clostridium perfringens carry antibiotic resistance genes and if the genes are mobile.
carcass measurements were taken on 1,292 steers and collected by the american shorthorn association. the sires were purebred or appendix-registered shorthorn. because all dams were not shorthorn, genetic fractions of breeds of origin were determined for each dam. measurements for hot carcass weight; dressing percentage; fat thickness; ribeye area; kidney, pelvic, and heart fat (kph); marbling; and yield grade were analyzed jointly with a multivariate reml algorithm to estimate heritabilities of and genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits. the sire model chosen as best fit of the data included fixed effects of herd of origin (377 classes), slaughter group (118 classes), year of birth (1979-1995), and covariates for linear effects of genetic fractions of breeds (13) of dam and slaughter age, with sire (n=409) as a random effect. estimates of heritability were .60+/-.19, .49+/-.19, .46+/-.19, .97+/-.21, .45+/-.19, .88+/-.21, and .54+/-.19 for previous order of traits, respectively. most genetic correlations were not significantly different from zero. genetic correlations of hot carcass weight were significant and positive with dressing percentage (.65+/-.19) and with ribeye area (.70+/-.14). dressing percentage was significantly positively genetically correlated with ribeye area (.79+/-.16) and negatively genetically correlated with yield grade (-.56+/-.29). yield grade was also significantly negatively genetically correlated with ribeye area (-.85+/-.10) and positively genetically correlated with fat thickness (.67+/-.15). most phenotypic correlations were significant and positive. only the phenotypic correlations of dressing percentage with marbling and with yield grade, and ribeye area with kph and with marbling were not significantly different from zero. significant negative correlations were fat thickness with ribeye area (-.16+/-.04) and ribeye area with yield grade (-.61+/-.03). results seem to indicate that genetic antagonisms between quantity and quality traits were small to moderate. thus, the opportunity seems to exist for breeding plans to improve carcass quality without having any adverse genetic effect on hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, or ribeye area. the high heritability observed for marbling indicates that a low genetic potential for marbling can be remedied by selection within breed. least squares means, genetic (sigma g), and phenotypic (sigma p) standard deviations, and phenotypic coefficients of variation (cv) were estimated on an age-constant basis for growth, carcass, and meat traits of castrate males from 12 breed groups combined, for 9 purebreds combined, and for the f3 generation of three composite populations combined to which the nine purebreds contributed. also, heritabilities (h2) and genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations were estimated among growth, carcass, and meat traits for all breed groups combined involving 1,594 individuals that were the progeny of 306 sires (214 purebred and 92 composites). coefficients of variation and sigma g generally were similar for composites and contributing purebreds for growth and size-related traits. for traits relating to carcass composition and meat quality, means, sigma p, or cv for composites and contributing purebreds generally were similar. generally, estimates of sigma g and h2 were similar among all breed groups combined, contributing purebreds combined, and composites combined. generally, rg were high among all measures of carcass fat, indicating major difficulty in achieving a high percentage of retail product simultaneously with a high fat content of the longissimus muscle that is required for carcass quality grade. generally, rp were of smaller magnitude than rg. all rp of marbling score or percentage of ether-extracted fat in the longissimus muscle with all end-use properties relating to palatability including shear force, and sensory evaluation of tenderness, juiciness, and flavor were below .30.
background persistent staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (psab) is an emerging problem among hospitalized patients. we studied key clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with psab to better define the epidemiological features of this increasingly recognized clinical entity.   methods a retrospective case-control study of patients hospitalized with sab between january 1, 2001, and september 30, 2004, was conducted to compare the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with psab (> 7 days of bacteremia) with those of a cohort of patients with nonpersistent sab (< 3 days of bacteremia). patients with 4 to 6 days of bacteremia were excluded from the analysis. to detect a potential association between reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and persistent methicillin-resistant sab, vancomycin susceptibilities were confirmed using standard dilution methods.   results eighty-four patients with psab and 152 patients with nonpersistent sab were included in the analysis. methicillin resistance (odds ratio [or], 5.22; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.63-10.38), intravascular catheter or other foreign body use (or, 2.37; 95% ci, 1.11-3.96), chronic renal failure (or, 2.08; 95% ci, 1.09-3.96), more than 2 sites of infection (or, 3.31; 95% ci, 1.17-9.38), and infective endocarditis (or, 10.30; 95% ci, 2.98-35.64) were independently associated with psab. the mean time to device removal was significantly longer in patients with psab than in patients with nonpersistent sab (4.94 vs 1.64 days; p < .01). there was no evidence of reduced vancomycin susceptibility among persistent methicillin-resistant s aureus isolates. clinical outcomes were significantly worse among patients with psab.   conclusions many hospitalized patients may be at risk for psab. aggressive attempts to minimize the risk of complications and poor outcomes associated with psab, such as early device removal, should be encouraged. background the causes of persistent bacteremia (pb) due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) are poorly understood. this investigation examined potential associations between pb with key clinical features and several in vitro bacterial genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, in isolates from 1 institution.   methods pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) relatedness, thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (tpmp)-susceptibility phenotype, accessory gene regulator (agr) genotype and functionality (via delta-lysin production), and autolysis phenotypes were assessed in mrsa isolates from the bloodstream of 21 prospectively identified patients with pb (blood cultures positive after > or =7 days of therapy) and of 18 patients with resolving bacteremia (rb) (sterile blood cultures within the first 2-4 days of therapy) due to mrsa.   results the 2 groups had comparable baseline characteristics but differed in their clinical courses (e.g., endocarditis was more frequent in patients with pb than in those with rb [43% vs. 0%, respectively; p=.0016]); isolates from patients with pb exhibited higher rates of (1) survival in vitro after exposure to tpmp (22.4+/-14.8% vs. 11.6+/-6.5%, respectively; p=.005); (2) defective delta-lysin production (71.4% vs. 38.9%, respectively; p=.057); (3) non-agr genotype ii profile (100% vs. 77.8%, respectively; p=.037); and (4) overrepresentation of a specific pfge genotype (85.7% vs. 44.4%, respectively; p=.015).   conclusions isolates from patients with pb differed from those in patients with rb, in several in vitro characteristics. further studies will be necessary to define how these factors might affect clinical outcome.
a nonparametric family of conditional distributions is introduced, which generalizes conditional exponential families using functional parameters in a suitable rkhs. an algorithm is provided for learning the generalized natural parameter, and consistency of the estimator is established in the well specified case. in experiments, the new method generally outperforms a competing approach with consistency guarantees, and is competitive with a deep conditional density model on datasets that exhibit abrupt transitions and heteroscedasticity. in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
as the semantic web expands, ontological data becomes distributed over a large network of data sources on the web. consequently, evaluating queries that aim to tap into this distributed semantic database necessitates the ability to consult multiple data sources efficiently. in this paper, we propose methods and heuristics to efficiently query distributed ontological data based on a series of properties of summarized data. in our approach, each source summarizes its data as another rdf graph, and relevant section of these summaries are merged and analyzed at query evaluation time. we show how the analysis of these summaries enables more efficient source selection, query pruning and transformation of expensive distributed joins into local joins. query processing of owl-dl ontologies is intractable in the worst case, but we present a novel technique that in practice allows for efficient querying of ontologies with large aboxes in secondary storage. we focus on the processing of instance retrieval queries, i.e., queries that retrieve individuals in the abox which are instances of a given concept c. our technique uses summarization and refinement to reduce instance retrieval to a small relevant subset of the original abox. we demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in aboxes with up to 7 million assertions. our results are applicable to the very expressive description logic shin, which corresponds to owl-dl minus nominals and datatypes.
background childhood cancer survivors (ccs) are at increased risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms, including gastrointestinal (gi) cancer. we performed a systematic review to summarize all available literature on the risk of, risk factors for, and outcome after subsequent gi cancer among ccs.   methods a systematic search of the literature databases medline/pubmed (1945-2014) and embase (1947-2014) was performed to identify studies that consisted of ⩾1000 ccs and assessed incidence of or mortality from subsequent gi cancer as an outcome.   results a total of 45 studies were included. studies that reported risk measures for subsequent gi cancer compared to the general population showed a 3.2 to 9.7-fold elevated risk in cohort studies including all childhood cancer types. abdominal radiotherapy was associated with an increased risk of subsequent gi cancer in all four studies that assessed this risk. survivors who had received procarbazine and platinum agents were also suggested to be at increased risk.   conclusion abdominal radiotherapy is a risk factor for developing a subsequent gi cancer. few studies examined detailed treatment-related risk factors and most studies had small number of gi cancer cases. therefore, no conclusions could be drawn on the effect of time since childhood cancer on gi cancer risk and on outcome after a subsequent gi cancer. additional research is necessary to further explore risk factors for and outcome after a subsequent gi cancer, and to systematically evaluate the harms and benefits of gi screening among high-risk survivors in order to give sound screening recommendations. background although elevated risks of pancreatic cancer have been observed in long-term survivors of hodgkin lymphoma (hl), no prior study has assessed the risk of second pancreatic cancer in relation to radiation dose and specific chemotherapeutic agents.   patients and methods we conducted an international case-control study within a cohort of 19 882 hl survivors diagnosed from 1953 to 2003 including 36 cases and 70 matched controls.   results median ages at hl and pancreatic cancer diagnoses were 47 and 60.5 years, respectively; median time to pancreatic cancer was 19 years. pancreatic cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose to the pancreatic tumor location (ptrend = 0.005) and increasing number of alkylating agent (aa)-containing cycles of chemotherapy (ptrend = 0.008). the odds ratio (or) for patients treated with both subdiaphragmatic radiation (≥10 gy) and ≥6 aa-containing chemotherapy cycles (13 cases, 6 controls) compared with patients with neither treatment was 17.9 (95% confidence interval 3.5-158). the joint effect of these two treatments was significantly greater than additive (p = 0.041) and nonsignificantly greater than multiplicative (p = 0.29). especially high risks were observed among patients receiving ≥8400 mg/m(2) of procarbazine with nitrogen mustard or ≥3900 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide.   conclusion our study demonstrates for the first time that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy substantially increase pancreatic cancer risks among hl survivors treated in the past. these findings extend the range of nonhematologic cancers associated with chemotherapy and add to the evidence that the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can lead to especially large risks.
background affective syndrome is thought to be a key feature that differentiates schizophrenia from schizoaffective disorder (sa) and bipolar disorder with psychotic features (bdp). however genetic underpinnings of these differences remain unresolved.   objectives we compared clinical variables of affective psychoses (sa, bdp and schizophrenia with affective symptoms (aff scz)) and schizophrenia without affective symptoms (non-aff scz) and searched for a genetic variant that may differentiate affective psychosis from non-aff scz.   methods a total of 2677 subjects, including 831 patients with affective psychosis, 785 patients with non-aff scz and 1061 healthy controls, were used. clinical symptoms were assessed with the panss. the sample was genotyped for 5-httlpr polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene.   results the diagnostic groups differed significantly on demographic and clinical variables. the percentage of men was higher, the current age and age at illness onset were lower in non-aff scz and sa compared to aff scz and bdp. the severity of positive and negative symptoms decreased significantly from group to group in the following manner: non-aff scz>aff scz>sa>bdp. there was the association between 5-httlpr polymorphism and affective psychosis (p=0.01). the frequency of the ss genotype was higher in the affective psychosis group compared to non-aff scz and controls. no differences in the genotype distribution were identified between the non-aff scz group and controls.   limitations difficulties in the differentiation between non-aff scz and aff scz or sa and between aff scz and sa due to uncertain diagnostic boundaries between these conditions.   conclusions sa is intermediate between non-aff scz and bdp in the severity of positive and negative symptoms. the first episode patients, carriers of the ss genotype have a higher risk of developing affective psychosis than non-aff scz. this finding carries implications for the prognosis of psychosis outcomes in the first-episode patients. abstract: depression and suicidal behavior are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia. the serotonin transporter protein regulates serotonergic signaling at synapses and is encoded by a single gene (slc6a4; locus link id: 6532), located at 17q11.1-q12 with two polymorphic variants (the short and the long allele). the short allele of serotonin transporter gene has been associated with depression and suicidality in individuals who suffered negative life events and with depression in individuals with chronic psychosis.. subjects were recruited from a genetic study of schizophrenia conducted in costa rica. the authors replicated their previous research, using a more narrow phenotype (only schizophrenic subjects) and a more ethnically homogenous sample (only costa rican schizophrenic individuals who were not included in the previous study). the authors hypothesized that subjects with at least one copy of the serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism (5-httlpr) “s” allele would have a greater history of lifetime depression and suicidability rate than those who had an “l/l” genotype. the authors analyzed 155 subjects with a dsm-iv (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition) diagnosis of schizophrenia (73% male, age at interview 38.3, sd = 11.23). the genotype distribution was “ss” 58 (37%), “sl” 69 (45%), and “ll” 28 (18%). in the secondary analysis, the authors explored association of the “s” allele with lifetime history of suicide behavior in 173 subjects (18 more subjects than primary analysis because schizophrenic individuals were included regardless of history of depression). the authors found that subjects carrying at least one short allele had a significant increased lifetime risk for depressive syndromes (χ2 = 5.4, df = 1, p = 0.02; odds ratio [or] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.15–6.3). no association was found for suicidal behavior in the same sample (χ2 = 0.928, p = 0.629). in conclusion, the genotype at the 5-httlpr promoter polymorphic locus increases the risk of developing major depression but not suicidal behavior during the course of the schizophrenia in these patients. due to the small sample size, these results should be followed by definitive replication.
the phenotype of calcium channel subunit (cacn) α2δ3 knockout (ko) mice includes sensory cross-activation and deficient pain perception. sensory cross-activation defines the activation of a sensory cortical region by input from another modality due to reorganization in the brain such as after sensory loss. to obtain mechanistic insight into both phenomena, we employed a comprehensive battery of neuroanatomical techniques. while cacnα2δ3 was ubiquitously expressed in wild-type mice, it was absent in α2δ3 ko animals. immunostaining of α1a, α1b, and α1e revealed upregulation of n-type and r-type, but not p/q-type cav2 channels in cortical neurons of cacnα2δ3 ko mice. compared to wild-type mice, axonal processes in somatosensory cortex were enhanced, and dendritic processes reduced, in cacnα2δ3 ko mice. immunohistochemical and mri analyses, investigating morphology, thalamocortical and intra-/intercortical trajectories, revealed a disparity between projection and commissural fibers with reduction of the number of spatial specificity of thalamocortical projections. l1cam staining revealed wide-ranging projections of thalamocortical fibers reaching both somatosensory/motor and visual cortical areas. activation (c-fos+) of excitatory and inhibitory neurons suggested that deficient pain perception in α2δ3 ko mice is unlikely to result from cortical disinhibition. collectively, our data demonstrate that knock out of cacn α2δ3 results in some structural abnormalities whose functional implications converge to dedifferentiation of sensory activation. the thalamocortical tract carries sensory information to the neocortex. it has long been recognized that the neocortical pioneer axons of subplate neurons are essential for thalamocortical development. herein we report that an axon guidance cue, draxin, is expressed in early-born neocortical neurons, including subplate neurons, and is necessary for thalamocortical development. in draxin−/− mice, thalamocortical axons do not enter the neocortex. this phenotype is sufficiently rescued by the transgenic expression of draxin in neocortical neurons. genetic interaction data suggest that draxin acts through deleted in colorectal cancer (dcc) and neogenin (neo1), to regulate thalamocortical projections in vivo. draxin promotes the outgrowth of thalamic axons in vitro and this effect is abolished in thalamic neurons from dcc and neo1 double mutants. these results suggest that draxin from neocortical neurons controls thalamocortical projections into the neocortex, and that this effect is mediated through the dcc and neo1 receptors.
key messageco-suppressing major kafirin sub-classes is fundamental to improved protein digestibility and nutritional value of sorghum. the improvement is linked to an irregularly invaginated phenotype of protein bodies.abstractthe combined suppression of only two genes, γ kafirin-1 (25 kda) and γ-kafirin-2 (50 kda), significantly increases sorghum kafirin in vitro digestibility. co-suppression of a third gene, α-kafirin a1 (25 kda), in addition to the two genes increases the digestibility further. the high-digestibility trait has previously only been obtained either through the co-suppression of six kafirin genes (α-a1, 25 kda; α-b1, 19 kda; α-b2, 22 kda; γ-kaf1, 27 kda; γ-kaf 2, 50 kda; and δ-kaf 2, 18 kda) or through random chemical-induced mutations (for example, the high protein digestibility mutant). we present further evidence that suppressing just three of these genes alters kafirin protein cross-linking and protein body microstructure to an irregularly invaginated phenotype. the irregular invaginations are consistent with high pepsin enzyme accessibility and hence high digestibility. the approach we adopted towards increasing sorghum protein digestibility appears to be an effective tool in improving the status of sorghum as a principal supplier of energy and protein in poor communities residing in marginal agro-ecological zones of africa. abstract to improve sorghum grain protein nutritional quality, improved sorghum lines were transformed to suppress the synthesis of different kafirin sub-classes, or backcrossed into transgenic lines with improved protein quality. co-suppression of the alpha-, gamma- and delta-kafirin sub-classes and removal of the tannin trait resulted in transgenic sorghum lines with high cooked protein digestibility (±80%), improved amino acid score (0.8) and protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (0.7) compared to the non-transgenic null controls (±50%, 0.4 and 0.2, respectively). these high protein quality lines had a floury endosperm. they also had modified protein body structure, where the protein bodies were irregular shaped with few to numerous invaginations and were less densely packed, with a dense protein matrix visible around the protein bodies. when fewer sub-classes were suppressed, i.e. gamma 1 and delta 2, the endosperm was corneous with normal protein body structure but the improvement in cooked protein digestibility appeared to be less. apparently, co-suppression of several kafirin sub-classes is required to obtain high protein nutritional quality sorghum lines, but this seems to result in floury-type grain endosperm texture.
tolerance to the local antiallodynic effects of morphine, dpdpe ([d-pen(2),d-pen(5)]-enkephalin) or jwh-015 ((2-methyl-1-propyl-1h-indol-3-yl)-1-naphthalenylmethanone) after their repeated administration during neuropathic pain was evaluated. the role of the nitric oxide-cgmp-protein kinase g (pkg)-c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) signaling pathway on the peripheral morphine-induced tolerance after the chronic constriction of sciatic nerve in mice was also assessed. the mechanical and thermal antiallodynic effects produced by a high dose of morphine, dpdpe or jwh-015 subplantarly administered daily from days 10 to 20 after nerve injury were estimated with the von frey filaments and cold plate tests. the antiallodynic effects of the repeated administration of morphine combined with a sub-analgesic dose of a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (nos2) (l-n(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine; l-nil), l-guanylate cyclase (1h-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one; odq), pkg ((rp)-8-(para-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate; rp-8-pcpt-cgmps) or jnk (anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2h)-one; sp600125) inhibitor from days 10 to 20 after injury were also evaluated. the repeated administration of morphine, but not dpdpe or jwh-015, produced a rapid development of tolerance to its mechanical and thermal antiallodynic effects in sciatic nerve-injured mice. the co-administration of morphine with l-nil, odq, rp-8-pcpt-cgmps or sp600125 avoided the development of morphine antiallodynic tolerance after nerve injury. these findings reveal that the repeated local administration of dpdpe or jwh-015 did not induce antinociceptive tolerance after sciatic nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. our data also indicate that the peripheral nitric oxide-cgmp-pkg-jnk signaling pathway participates in the development of morphine tolerance after nerve injury and propose the inactivation of this pathway as a promising strategy to avoid morphine tolerance during neuropathic pain. in the present study, we investigated the possible development of tolerance to the antihyperalgesic effect of µ‐opioid receptor (mor) agonists under a neuropathic pain‐like state. repeated treatment with fentanyl, but not morphine or oxycodone, produced a rapid development of tolerance to its antihyperalgesic effect in mice with sciatic nerve ligation. like the behavioral study, g‐protein activation induced by fentanyl was significantly reduced in membranes obtained from the spinal cord of nerve‐ligated mice with in vivo repeated injection of fentanyl. in β‐endorphin‐knockout mice with nerve ligation, developed tolerance to the antihyperalgesic effect of fentanyl was abolished, and reduced g‐protein activation by fentanyl after nerve ligation with fentanyl was reversed to the normal level. the present findings indicate that released β‐endorphin within the spinal cord may be implicated in the rapid development of tolerance to fentanyl under a neuropathic pain‐like state.
we study integrability properties of a general version of the boltzmann collision operator for hard and soft potentials in n-dimensions. a reformulation of the collisional integrals allows us to write the weak form of the collision operator as a weighted convolution, where the weight is given by an operator invariant under rotations. using a symmetrization technique in lp we prove a young’s inequality for hard potentials, which is sharp for maxwell molecules in the l2 case. further, we find a new hardy-littlewood-sobolev type of inequality for boltzmann collision integrals with soft potentials. the same method extends to radially symmetric, non-increasing potentials that lie in some $${l^{s}_{weak}}$$ or ls. the method we use resembles a brascamp, lieb and luttinger approach for multilinear weighted convolution inequalities and follows a weak formulation setting. consequently, it is closely connected to the classical analysis of young and hardy-littlewood-sobolev inequalities. in all cases, the inequality constants are explicitly given by formulas depending on integrability conditions of the angular cross section (in the spirit of grad cut-off). as an additional application of the technique we also obtain estimates with exponential weights for hard potentials in both conservative and dissipative interactions. we investigate a boltzmann equation for inelastic scattering in which the relative velocity in the collision frequency is approximated by the thermal speed. the inelasticity is given by a velocity variable restitution coefficient. this equation is the analog to the boltzmann classical equation for maxwellian molecules. we study the homogeneous regime using fourier analysis methods. we analyze the existence and uniqueness questions, the linearized operator around the dirac delta function, self-similar solutions and moment equations. we clarify the conditions under which self-similar solutions describe the asymptotic behavior of the homogeneous equation. we obtain formally a hydrodynamic description for near elastic particles under the assumption of constant and variable restitution coefficient. we describe the linear long-wave stability/instability for homogeneous cooling states.
backgroundin the 1990s, epidemiological studies estimated the prevalence of stroke caused by atrial fibrillation (af) at about 15 %. given the aging population, there is a rise in the number of af patients. af prevention guidelines based on clinical practice and the literature have been published and updated since 2001. implementation seems to have an impact on the prescription of vitamin k antagonist (vka). during the last 20 years, few population-based studies have focused on the prevalence of atrial arrhythmia (aa) in patients with stroke. the objective of the present prospective study, using data from 2008, was to evaluate the prevalence of aa (atrial fibrillation/flutter) in patients with stroke and the impact of implementing af guidelines.methodsthe prevalence of aa was studied in patients diagnosed with stroke from january 1 to december 31, 2008 in the population-based stroke registry of brest, france (total population, 363,760 according to the 2008 census, with 295,553 aged 15 years or older). guidelines implementation was assessed in terms of antithrombotic therapy (vka, antiplatelet agent, none), and the chads2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack).results851 cases of stroke were identified. the prevalence of aa was 31.7 % (n = 264), and increased with age from < 20 % in patients aged 45 to 54 years to nearly 50 % in patients ≥ 85 years. in patients with aa, 231 strokes were ischemic, 28 hemorrhagic and 5 undetermined. at time of stroke, aa was known in 207 patients (78.4 %). 54 of the 152 patients with chads2 score ≥ 2 (35.5 %) were treated with vka; this proportion decreased with age: 50 % between 50 and 74 years, 43.8 % between 75 and 84 years, and 25 % at 85 years and older.conclusionthe prevalence of aa in the population-based brest stroke registry in 2008 was higher than that reported by studies conducted 20 years ago. despite publication of af prevention guidelines, vka prescription and use in elderly patients were significantly low. background: prospective population-based studies are important to accurately determine the incidence and characteristics of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (af), while avoiding selection bias which may complicate hospital-based studies. methods: we investigated af-associated stroke within the north dublin population stroke study, a prospective cohort study of stroke/transient ischaemic attack in 294,592 individuals, according to recommended criteria for rigorous stroke epidemiological studies. results: of 568 stroke patients ascertained in the first year, 31.2% (177/568) were associated with af (90.4%, i.e. 160/177 ischaemic infarcts). the crude incidence rate of all af-associated stroke was 60/100,000 person-years (95% ci = 52–70). prior stroke was almost twice as common in af compared to non-af groups (21.9 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.01). the frequency of af progressively increased across ischaemic stroke patients stratified by increasing stroke severity (nihss 0–4, 29.7%; 5–9, 38.1%; 10–14, 43.8%; ≥15, 53.3%, p < 0.0001). the 90-day trajectory of recovery of af-associated stroke was identical to that of non-af stroke, but rankin scores in af stroke remained higher at 7, 28 and 90 days (p < 0.001 for all). discussion: af-associated stroke occurred in one third of all patients and was associated with a distinct profile of recurrent, severe and disabling stroke. targeted strategies to increase anticoagulation rates may provide a substantial benefit to prevent severe disabling stroke at a population level.
considering that disrupted sleep may be detrimental to daytime performance in people with dementia, we set out to construct a questionnaire able to identify sleep patterns potentially associated with clinical and functional disease variables in this population. two subsets of items indicative of patterns of unstable sleep and of disordered rapid eye movement sleep (rem) were selected. the first included items investigating sleep continuity, with low sleep continuity markers considered indicative of high arousability; the second included items investigating the frequency and quality of dreams and the frequency of clinically identifiable rem sleep behaviour disorder episodes. the questionnaire was administered to 140 outpatients with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease. the mini-mental state examination (mmse), activities of daily living (adl), instrumental activities of daily living, neuropsychiatric inventory and clinical dementia rating (cdr) were administered to quantify cognitive, functional and behavioural impairment. a subscale comprising items investigating sleep discontinuity/fragmentation and showing high internal consistency was constructed and found to correlate significantly with variables considered indexes of cognitive and functional deterioration in ad (mmse, adl and cdr). conversely, it did not prove possible to obtain a subscale of dysfunctional rem phenomena. the use of a rapidly and easily administered sleep scale, like the one we constructed, appears to be suitable for early identification and longitudinal monitoring of sleep disturbances in ad. disturbed sleep cycles are the principal cause of institutionalization in dementia, and therefore represent a major clinical problem. they may arise from dysfunction within the circadian clock of the hypothalamus that times and consolidates wakefulness, or from neuropathology in output pathways and/or target sites of the clock specifically controlling sleep and wakefulness. to determine the relationship of disturbed activity cycles to other circadian clock-controlled rhythms, cross-sectional and longitudinal actigraphy and serial sampling of saliva were used to compare the impact of early alzheimer's dementia on activity/rest and cortisol rhythms in home-dwelling subjects. mildly demented subjects had daily activity rhythms comparable to those of healthy age-matched subjects. moderately demented subjects exhibited a range of disturbances of the activity/rest cycle, with reduced stability, increased fragmentation and loss of amplitude. within the moderately demented group, however, the degree of circadian disruption was not correlated with the individual severity of dementia. all groups of subjects, mild, moderate with normal activity cycles and moderate with abnormal activity cycles, exhibited robust daily profiles of salivary cortisol, with highest levels in the morning (08:00 h) and an evening nadir (20:00-24:00 h). salivary cortisol levels tended to be higher in the moderately demented subjects in the afternoon, but this effect was not specific to those with abnormal activity/rest patterns. the actimetric data confirm that deterioration of activity/rest cycles is a common and progressive feature in home-dwelling alzheimer's patients, occurring early in the disease but after the measurable onset of dementia. the maintenance of highly rhythmic daily cortisol profiles in association with disturbed activity profiles, both on an individual and on a group basis, demonstrates that loss of circadian control to activity/rest cycles is not a consequence of global circadian disruption in early dementia. rather, pathology may develop in discrete elements of the circadian clockwork and/or its output systems that control activity/rest, sleep and wakefulness. further characterization of this pathology will facilitate more effective management of sleep patterns in home-dwelling demented patients.
scope carnosic acid (ca) and rosemary extracts (res) have antiobesity effects but the mechanisms are not understood. we investigated some of the potential mechanisms contributing to the metabolic effects of an re enriched in ca.   methods and results an re (∼40% ca) was administered to lean (le, fa/+) and obese (ob, fa/fa) female zucker rats for 64 days. several adipocytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, phosphorylated amp-activated protein kinase, and hepatic gene expression changes were investigated. the re significantly decreased circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (re/ct = 0.36, p < 0.0003), il-1β (0.48, p < 0.032), and leptin (0.48, p < 0.002), and upregulated adiponectin (1.47, p < 0.045) in the le rats. the re also induced phase i and phase ii gene expression and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. notably, the re decreased adipose phosphorylated amp-activated protein kinase and did not affect hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha in the ob rats.   conclusion our results show that an re rich in ca exerts anti-inflammatory effects and affects hepatic metabolism in normal le rats. we report significant differences in the expression and regulation of key metabolic sensors between le and ob rats that may contribute to explain the different ability of the two genotypes to respond to the re. the worldwide epidemic of obesity has brought considerable attention to research aimed at understanding the biology of adipocytes (fat cells) and the events occurring in adipose tissue (fat) and in the bodies of obese individuals. accumulating evidence indicates that obesity causes chronic low-grade inflammation and that this contributes to systemic metabolic dysfunction that is associated with obesity-linked disorders. adipose tissue functions as a key endocrine organ by releasing multiple bioactive substances, known as adipose-derived secreted factors or adipokines, that have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activities. dysregulated production or secretion of these adipokines owing to adipose tissue dysfunction can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-linked complications. in this review, we focus on the role of adipokines in inflammatory responses and discuss their potential as regulators of metabolic function.
in motor cortex, long-range output to subcortical motor circuits depends on excitatory and inhibitory inputs converging on projection neurons in layers 5a/b. how interneurons interconnect with these projection neurons, and whether these microcircuits are interneuron and/or projection specific, is unclear. we found that fast-spiking interneurons received strong intralaminar (horizontal) excitation from pyramidal neurons in layers 5a/b including corticostriatal and corticospinal neurons, implicating them in mediating disynaptic recurrent, feedforward, and feedback inhibition within and across the two projection classes. low-threshold-spiking (lts) interneurons were instead strongly excited by descending interlaminar (vertical) input from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, implicating them in mediating disynaptic feedforward inhibition to both projection classes. furthermore, in a novel pattern, lower layer 2/3 preferentially excited interneurons in one layer (5a/lts) and excitatory neurons in another (5b/corticospinal). thus, these inhibitory microcircuits in mouse motor cortex follow an orderly arrangement that is laminarly orthogonalized by interneuron-specific, projection-nonspecific connectivity. the extent to which neocortical pyramidal cells function as a local network is determined by the strength and probability of their connections. by mapping connections between pyramidal cells we show here that in a local network of about 600 pyramidal cells located within a cylindrical volume of 200 μm × 200 μm of neocortical layer 2/3, an individual pyramidal cell receives synaptic inputs from about 30 other pyramidal neurons, with the majority of epsp amplitudes in the 0.2–1.0 mv range. the probability of connection decreased from 0.09 to 0.01 with intercell distance (over the range 25–200 μm). within the same volume, local interneuron (fast‐spiking non‐accomodating interneuron, fs)‐pyramidal cell connections were about 10 times more numerous, with the majority of connections being reciprocal. the probability of excitatory and inhibitory connections between pyramidal cells and fs interneurons decreased only slightly with distance, being in the range 0.5–0.75. pyramidal cells in the local network received strong synaptic input during stimulation of afferent fibres in layers 1 and 6. minimal‐like stimulation of layer 1 or layer 6 inputs simultaneously induced postsynaptic potentials in connected pyramidal cells as well as in pyramidal‐fs cell pairs. these inputs readily induced firing of pyramidal cells, although synaptically connected cells displayed different firing patterns. unitary epsps in pyramidal‐pyramidal cell pairs did not detectably alter cell firing. fs interneurons fire simultaneously with pyramidal cells. in pyramidal‐fs cell pairs, both unitary epsps and ipsps efficiently modulated cell firing patterns. we suggest that computation in the local network may proceed not only by direct pyramidal‐pyramidal cell communication but also via local interneurons. with such a high degree of connectivity with surrounding pyramidal cells, local interneurons are ideally poised to both coordinate and expand the local pyramidal cell network via pyramidal‐ interneuron‐ pyramidal communication.
backgroundmelatonin is often used as a sleeping aid in elderly adults. as previous studies suggest a protective role of melatonin against osteoporosis, it is important to document its safety. treatment should not cause any hangover effect that could potentially lead to falls and fractures. we therefore aimed to evaluate the effect of melatonin on balance- and muscle function.methods and patientsin a double-blind placebo-controlled study, we randomized 81 postmenopausal women with osteopenia to receive 1 or 3 mg melatonin, or placebo nightly for 12 months. postural balance as well as muscle function was measured. in addition, we assessed quality of life and sleep at baseline and after 12 months treatment.resultscompared to placebo, one-year treatment with melatonin did not affect postural balance or risk of falls. furthermore, no significant changes between groups were observed in muscle strength in neither upper- nor lower extremities. treatment did not affect quality of life or sleep. however, in the subgroup of women with sleep disturbances at baseline, a trend towards an improved sleep quality was seen (p = 0.08).conclusiontreatment with melatonin is safe in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. there is no hangover effect affecting balance- and muscle function following the intake of melatonin. in women with a good quality of sleep, melatonin has no effect, however in poor quality of sleep, small doses of melatonin trended towards improving the quality.trial registration(# nct01690000) abstract:  the purpose of this double‐blind study was to assess the effects of nightly melatonin supplementation on bone health and quality of life in perimenopausal women. a total of 18 women (ages 45–54) were randomized to receive melatonin (3 mg, p.o., n = 13) or placebo (n = 5) nightly for 6 months. bone density was measured by calcaneal ultrasound. bone turnover marker (osteocalcin, oc for bone formation and ntx for bone resorption) levels were measured bimonthly in serum. participants completed menopause‐specific quality of life‐intervention (menqol) and pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) questionnaires before and after treatment. subjects also kept daily diaries recording menstrual cycling, well‐being, and sleep patterns. the results from this study showed no significant change (6‐month‐baseline) in bone density, ntx, or oc between groups; however, the ratio of ntx:oc trended downward over time toward a ratio of 1:1 in the melatonin group. melatonin had no effect on vasomotor, psychosocial, or sexual menqol domain scores; however, it did improve physical domain scores compared to placebo (mean change melatonin: −0.6 versus placebo: 0.1, p < 0.05). menstrual cycling was reduced in women taking melatonin (mean cycles melatonin: 4.3 versus placebo: 6.5, p < 0.05), and days between cycles were longer (mean days melatonin: 51.2 versus placebo: 24.1, p < 0.05). no differences in duration of menses occurred between groups. the overall psqi score and average number of hours slept were similar between groups. these findings show that melatonin supplementation was well tolerated, improved physical symptoms associated with perimenopause, and may restore imbalances in bone remodeling to prevent bone loss. further investigation is warranted.
the distribution of lipocaline-type prostaglandin d synthase (l-pgds) in rat brain was investigated by immunoelectron microscopy using a protein a-gold technique. in perivascular cells adjacent to the basement membrane of arterioles in the pia-arachnoid and of blood vessels in the subpial cortex, gold labeling was confined to the lumen of the dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, and not found in the few lysosomes present in the cytoplasm. the results suggest that the perivascular cells secrete l-pgds and seem not to degrade lipophilic molecules carried by l-pgds. moreover, gold particles representing the antigenic sites of l-pgds were found in the golgi apparatus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, vesicles, and nuclear envelope of arachnoid trabecular cells, arachnoid barrier cells, and arachnoid pia mater cells. the labeling was less detectable in the same organelles of choroid plexus epithelial cells, compared with leptomeningeal cells. in meningeal macrophages and parenchymal microglia, l-pgds was detected in lysosomes, multivesicular bodies, and endocytic vesicles. the production of l-pgds in perivascular cells is important to the various functions of this enzyme in brain parenchyma. glutathione-independent prostaglandin d synthase [prostaglandin-h2 d-isomerase; (5z,13e)-(15s)-9 alpha,11 alpha-epidioxy-15-hydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoate d-isomerase, ec 5.3.99.2] is an enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of prostaglandin d2 in the central nervous system. in situ hybridization with antisense rna for the enzyme indicated that mrna for the enzyme was predominantly expressed in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes of the adult rat brain. the findings agree with those obtained by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the enzyme. it was further revealed that prostaglandin d synthase activity was considerably greater in the isolated leptomeninges (14.2 nmol per min per mg of protein) and choroid plexus (7.0 nmol per min per mg of protein) than the activity in the whole brain (2.0 nmol per min per mg of protein). these results, taken together, indicate that the enzyme is mainly synthesized and located in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes in the brain.
this study investigates how secondhand smoke (shs) exposure influences neonatal birth weight in jordan, a country with high smoking prevalence. the findings revealed that as the average number of shs exposure hours per week increased in the second trimester, the neonatal birth weight decreased while holding all covariates constant. women who reported a higher average number of shs exposure hours per week from work in the second trimester, home in the third trimester, and outside in the third trimester were at greater risk for having a low birth weight neonate than women who reported a lower average number of shs exposure hours. we analysed the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy on fetal growth parameters in 129 term newborns. children were classified into four depending on exposure on the basis of a questionnaire completed by the mother. the results confirmed that tobacco smoking reduced weight, length, cranial and thoracic perimeters at birth when exposure was due to either active or passive smoking. weight deficits of infants whose mothers smoked heavily (458 g) were higher than those whose mothers were exposed to passive smoking (192 g). we conclude that passive smoking is a very important variable and should be taken into account in any study of neonatal growth parameters.
tacrolimus requires close therapeutic drug monitoring because of its narrow therapeutic index and marked interindividual pharmacokinetic variation. in this study, we investigated the associations of polymorphisms in the gene encoding 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (hsd11b1) with tacrolimus concentrations in chinese renal transplant recipients during the early posttransplantation stage. a total of 258 renal transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus with prednisone (30 mg) combined therapy were genotyped for hsd11b1 rs846908, rs846910, rs4844880, and cyp3a5*3 polymorphisms. tacrolimus trough concentrations were determined on days 6–9 after transplantation, measured by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. among the cyp3a5 expressers, the dose-adjusted trough concentration (c0/d) of tacrolimus in hsd11b1 rs846908 aa homozygous individuals was considerably lower than found in gg+ga carriers [56.2 (23.9-86.6) versus 76.7 (12.6–220.0) (ng/ml)/(mg/kg), p = 0.0204]; hsd11b1 rs846910 aa homozygotes had a lower tacrolimus c0/d compared with gg+ga carriers [51.2 (23.9–86.6) versus 76.3 (12.6–220.0) (ng/ml)/(mg/kg), p = 0.0367]; carriers with the hsd11b1 rs4844880 aa genotype had a significantly lower tacrolimus c0/d with respect to carriers of tt+ta genotypes [61.3 (23.9–97.5) versus 77.2 (12.6–220.0) (ng/ml)/(mg/kg), p = 0.0002]; the hsd11b1 aa-aa-aa haplotype carriers had a lower tacrolimus c0/d than noncarriers [51.2 (23.9–86.6) versus 76.3 (12.6–220.0) (ng/ml)/(mg/kg), p = 0.0367]. these findings illustrate that the hsd11b1 genotypes are closely correlated with tacrolimus trough concentrations, suggesting that these polymorphisms may be useful for safer dosing of tacrolimus. objective regeneration of cortisol by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-hsd1) within liver and adipose tissue may be of pathophysiological importance in obesity and the metabolic syndrome. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in hsd11b1, the gene encoding 11β-hsd1, have been associated with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in population-based cohort studies, and with hyperandrogenism in patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). however, the functional consequences of these snps for in vivo 11β-hsd1 expression and activity are unknown.   methods we explored associations of well-characterised hormonal and metabolic phenotypes with two common snps (rs846910 and rs12086634) in hsd11b1 in 600 women (300 with pcos) and investigated 11β-hsd1 expression and activity in a nested study of 40 women from this cohort.   results hsd11b1 genotypes (as single snps and as the combination of the two minor allele snps) were not associated with pcos. women who were heterozygous for rs846910 a and homozygous for rs12086634 t (ga, tt genotype) had a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, regardless of the diagnosis of pcos (odds ratio in the whole cohort=2.77 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.16-6.67), p=0.023). in the nested cohort, women with the ga, tt genotype had higher hsd11b1 mrna levels in adipose tissue, and higher rates of appearance of cortisol and d3-cortisol (16.1±0.7 nmol/min versus 12.1±1.1, p=0.044) during 9,11,12,12-2h4-cortisol (d4-cortisol) steady-state infusion.   conclusions we conclude that, in a population of southern european caucasian women with and without pcos, alleles of hsd11b1 containing the two snps rs846910 a and rs12086634 t confer increased 11β-hsd1 expression and activity, which associates with the metabolic syndrome.
learning and exploiting problem structure is one of the key challenges in optimization. this is especially important for black-box optimization (bbo) where prior structural knowledge of a problem is not available. existing model-based evolutionary algorithms (eas) are very efficient at learning structure in both the discrete, and in the continuous domain. in this article, discrete and continuous model-building mechanisms are integrated for the mixed-integer (mi) domain, comprising discrete and continuous variables. we revisit a recently introduced model-based evolutionary algorithm for the mi domain, the genetic algorithm for model-based mixed-integer optimization (gambit). we extend gambit with a parameterless scheme that allows for practical use of the algorithm without the need to explicitly specify any parameters. we furthermore contrast gambit with other model-based alternatives. the ultimate goal of processing mixed dependences explicitly in gambit is also addressed by introducing a new mechanism for the explicit exploitation of mixed dependences. we find that processing mixed dependences with this novel mechanism allows for more efficient optimization. we further contrast the parameterless gambit with mixed-integer evolution strategies (mies) and other state-of-the-art mi optimization algorithms from the general algebraic modeling system (gams) commercial algorithm suite on problems with and without constraints, and show that gambit is capable of solving problems where variable dependences prevent many algorithms from successfully optimizing them. evolution strategies (ess) are powerful probabilistic search and optimization algorithms gleaned from biological evolution theory. they have been successfully applied to a wide range of real world applications. the modern ess are mainly designed for solving continuous parameter optimization problems. their ability to adapt the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution used for mutation during the optimization run makes them well suited for this domain. in this article we describe and study mixed integer evolution strategies (mies), which are natural extensions of es for mixed integer optimization problems. mies can deal with parameter vectors consisting not only of continuous variables but also with nominal discrete and integer variables. following the design principles of the canonical evolution strategies, they use specialized mutation operators tailored for the aforementioned mixed parameter classes. for each type of variable, the choice of mutation operators is governed by a natural metric for this variable type, maximal entropy, and symmetry considerations. all distributions used for mutation can be controlled in their shape by means of scaling parameters, allowing self-adaptation to be implemented. after introducing and motivating the conceptual design of the mies, we study the optimality of the self-adaptation of step sizes and mutation rates on a generalized (weighted) sphere model. moreover, we prove global convergence of the mies on a very general class of problems. the remainder of the article is devoted to performance studies on artificial landscapes (barrier functions and mixed integer nk landscapes), and a case study in the optimization of medical image analysis systems. in addition, we show that with proper constraint handling techniques, mies can also be applied to classical mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
abducens neurons undergo a dose-dependent synaptic blockade (either disinhibition or complete blockade) when tetanus neurotoxin (tent) is injected into the lateral rectus muscle at either a low (0.5) or a high dose (5 ng/kg). we studied the firing pattern and recruitment order in abducens neurons both in control and after tent injection. the eye position threshold for recruitment of control abducens neurons was exponentially related to the eye position and velocity sensitivities. we also found a constancy of recruitment threshold for different eye movement modalities (spontaneous, optokinetic, and vestibular). exponential relationships were found, as well, for eye velocity sensitivity during saccades and for position and velocity sensitivities during the vestibulo-ocular reflex. likewise, inverse relationships were found between recruitment threshold or position sensitivity with the antidromic latency in control abducens neurons. these relationships, however, did not apply following tent treatment. neuronal firing after tent appeared either disinhibited (low dose) or depressed (high dose), but the relationships between neuronal sensitivities and recruitment still applied. however, the pattern of recruitment shifted toward the treated side as more inputs were blocked by the low- and high-dose treatments, respectively. nonetheless, although the recruitment-to-sensitivity relationships persisted under the tent synaptic blockade, we conclude that synaptic inputs are determinant for establishing the recruitment threshold and recruitment spacing of abducens motoneurons and internuclear neurons. 1. single neurons in the abducens nucleus were recorded extracellularly in alert rhesus macaques trained to make a variety of eye movements. an abducens neurons was identified as a motoneuron (mn) if its action potentials triggered an averaged emg potential in the lateral rectus muscle. abducens internuclear neurons (inns) that project to the oculomotor nucleus were identified by collision block of spontaneous with antidromic action potentials evoked with a stimulating electrode placed in the medial rectus subdivision of the contralateral oculomotor nucleus. 2. all abducens mns and inns had qualitatively similar discharge patterns consisting of a burst of spikes for lateral saccades and a steady firing whose rate increased with lateral eye position in excess of a certain threshold. 3. for both mns and inns the firing rates associated with different, constant eye positions could be described accurately by a straight line with slope, k (the eye position sensitivity in spikes.s-1.deg-1), and intercept, t (the eye position threshold for steady firing). for different mns, k increased as t varied from more medial to more lateral values. in contrast, the majority of inns already were active for values of t more medial than 20 degrees and showed little evidence of recruitment according to k. 4. during horizontal sinusoidal smooth-pursuit eye movements, both mns and inns exhibited a sinusoidal modulation in firing rate whose peak preceded eye position. from these firing rate patterns, the component of firing rate related to eye velocity, r (the eye velocity sensitivity in spikes.s-1.deg-1.s-1), was determined. the r for inns was, on average, 78% larger than that for mns. furthermore, r increased with t for mns, whereas inns showed no evidence of recruitment according to r. if, as in the cat, the inns of monkeys provide the major input to medial rectus mns and if simian medial rectus mns behave like our abducens mns, then recruitment order, which is absent in inns, must be established at the mn pool itself. 5. unexpectedly, the r of mns decreased with the frequency of the smooth-pursuit movement. furthermore, the eye position sensitivity, k, obtained during steady fixations was usually less than that determined during smooth pursuit. therefore, conclusions about the roles of mns and premotor neurons based on how their r and k values differ must be viewed with caution if the data have been obtained under different tracking conditions.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
the aim of this study was to assess whether it is possible to derive accurate vertical measurements of the mandibular ramus and condyle from panoramic radiographs. a human dry skull was positioned in a panoramic machine. the skull was displaced along the sagittal and transverse plane and rotated around the vertical and transverse axes. a set of 252 digital radiographs with defined positioning errors was compared with a set of 42 radiographs in the 'ideal' position. the distances between the metal markers that had been attached at the angle of the mandible at a distance of 60 mm in the condyle region to produce fixed reference points on the radiographs were measured. statistical differences were investigated using friedman repeated measures analysis of variance on ranks followed by the dunnett's test for the comparison against the control group in the ideal position (α = 0.05). vertical measurements were significantly affected when the skull was rotated around the vertical (p < 0.001) or shifted along the transverse axis (p < 0.001). misalignment of the head affected the vertical measurement of the mandibular ramus and condyle. however, asymmetries of more than 6 per cent are probably not due to patient positioning in the panoramic machine. the objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of panoramic radiographs for diagnosing vertical asymmetry of the posterior mandible. the first part of the study used a model to evaluate the reproducibility of this particular panoramic machine. the tube traverse did not significantly affect the linear measurements, but the side of the machine where the structure was located produced an average of 2.1% variation in the total height of the mandible. in the second part of the study, the left-right (%) differences were measured on the panoramics and the laminographs of five skulls with lead markers. these differences were compared with the percent difference measured directly on the skull and with each other and suggested that the laminograph could be used as the "gold standard" for measuring posterior vertical mandibular asymmetry. the third part of the study evaluated a patient sample (n = 42). the correlation coefficient between the two types of films was determined to be 0.92 for total height and 0.39 for condyle height. using the 6% cutoff reported in the literature, the sensitivity of the panoramics to diagnose asymmetry for the total height was determined to be 0.62 and the specificity 1.0. this study suggests that the panoramic radiograph can be used to evaluate vertical posterior mandibular asymmetry, but there will be some underdiagnosis.
case reports of neurogenic pulmonary edema (npe) often indicate that the edema resolves quickly. because plasma epinephrine concentration may be elevated in npe, and epinephrine has been shown to increase the rate of alveolar liquid clearance (alc), we determined if alc was increased in a canine model of npe produced by the intracisternal administration of veratrine. alc was determined by instilling autologous plasma into a lower lung lobe and using the increase in instillate protein concentration after 4 h to calculate the volume of fluid cleared from the airspaces by mass balance. to prevent pulmonary hypertension and edema, which would confound the mass balance analysis, carotid arterial blood was allowed to drain into a reservoir as pulmonary arterial pressure started to rise after veratrine administration. alc in animals administered veratrine (n = 6) was 30.4 +/- 1.6 (se)% of the instilled volume compared with 14.1 +/- 2.1% observed in control animals. the increase in alc could be inhibited by adrenalectomy, beta2-adrenergic blockade using ici 118,551, or sodium channel blockade using amiloride and could be duplicated by infusing epinephrine to increase plasma epinephrine concentration to levels observed in npe. these data indicate that the increased alc was mediated by adrenal epinephrine and suggest that edema resolution in patients with npe might be accelerated by endogenous epinephrine. alveolar and lung liquid clearances were studied over 1, 4, and 6 h in intact anesthetized ventilated rats by instillation of 5% albumin solution with 1.5 microci of 125i-labeled albumin (3 ml/kg into 1 lung or 6 ml/kg into both lungs). alveolar protein clearance as measured by residual 125i-albumin in the lung over 6 h was similar to the slow rates measured in other species. alveolar liquid clearance was estimated by the concentration of albumin in the air spaces. after 1 h, this concentration was 7.8 +/- 0.7 g/dl, which was significantly greater than the initial protein concentration of 5.3 +/- 0.2 g/dl (p < 0.05). amiloride (10(-3) m) inhibited 45% of the basal alveolar liquid clearance, and ouabain (10(-3) m), instilled and intravenously infused (0.004 mg), inhibited 30% of the clearance. beta-adrenergic agonist instillation increased alveolar liquid clearance to the fastest 1-h rate (48 +/- 3% of instilled volume) that we observed in any intact species. the removal of the instilled fluid from the lung (expressed as lung liquid clearance; 0.96 +/- 0.3 ml/h) was twice as fast as the rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance reported in the isolated or in situ rat lung models. the rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance in these intact rats was significantly faster than those in prior studies in dogs and sheep and was similar to the rates in rabbits.
objective sedentary behavior such as television viewing may be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. however, few studies have assessed the impact of television viewing time on coronary artery calcification and it remains unclear how body fat contributes to this relationship. the aim of this study is to evaluate the association between television viewing time and subclinical atherosclerosis and whether effects on visceral or subcutaneous fat may mediate any associations observed. methods this was a cross-sectional study of 398 chinese participants (192 men and 206 women) from singapore prospective study. participants were free from known cardiovascular diseases and underwent interview, health screening, computed tomography scans of coronary arteries and abdomen. spearman’s correlation was used to test the correlation between television viewing time, physical activity, body composition and abdominal fat distribution. the association between television viewing time and subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. results in men, television viewing time was significantly correlated with higher body fat mass index, percent body fat, subcutaneous and visceral fat. these associations were in the same direction, but weaker and not statistically significant in women. television viewing time (hours/day) was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in men (odds ratio: 1.41, 95% ci: 1.03-1.93) but no significant association was observed in women (odds ratio: 0.88, 95% ci: 0.59-1.31) after adjusting for potential socio-demographic and lifestyle confounders. further adjustments for biological factors did not affect these associations. conclusions television viewing time was associated with greater adiposity and higher subcutaneous and visceral fat in men. tv viewing time was also associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in men and the potential mechanisms underlying this association require further investigation. objective both coronary artery calcification (cac) and the ankle brachial index (abi) are measures of subclinical atherosclerotic disease. the influence of physical activity on the longitudinal change in these measures remains unclear. to assess this relation we examined the association between these measures and self-reported physical activity in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (mesa).   methods at baseline, the mesa participants were free of clinically evident cardiovascular disease. we included all participants with an abi between 0.90 and 1.40 (n = 5656). predictor variables were based on self-reported measures with physical activity being assessed using the typical week physical activity survey from which metabolic equivalent-minutes/week of activity were calculated. we focused on physical activity intensity, intentional exercise, sedentary behavior, and conditioning. incident peripheral artery disease (pad) was defined as the progression of abi to values below 0.90 (given the baseline range of 0.90-1.40). incident cac was defined as a cac score >0 agatston units upon follow up with a baseline score of 0 agatston units.   results mean age of participants was 61 years, 53% were female, and mean body mass index was 28 kg/m(2). after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic factors, intentional exercise was protective for incident peripheral artery disease (relative risk (rr) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.74-0.98). after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic factors, there was a significant association between vigorous pa and incident cac (rr = 0.97, 95% ci: 0.94-1.00). there was also a significant association between sedentary behavior and increased amount of cac among participants with cac at baseline (δlog (agatston units + 25) = 0.027, 95% ci 0.002, 0.052).   conclusions these data suggest that there is an association between physical activity/sedentary behavior and the progression of two different measures of subclinical atherosclerotic disease.
objectives to assess the temporal trends in incidence of aids-defining opportunistic illnesses in an urban cohort of a middle-income country. methods hiv infected patients aged ≥18 years at cohort entry were included in this analysis. we calculated incidence rates per 1000 persons-years of observation for the first opportunistic illness presented after cohort enrollment, from 1987 to 2012. trends for overall and specific opportunistic illnesses were tested and incidence rate ratios for the most recent calendar period were calculated as the ratio between the incidence rate observed in the most recent period of the study (2009–2012) and the incidence rate observed in first period of the study (1987–1990). results overall, 3378 patients were included in this analysis; of which 1119 (33%) patients presented an opportunistic illness during follow up. incidence rates of all opportunistic illnesses decreased over time, and the overall opportunistic illness incidence rates fell from 295.4/1000 persons-years in 1987–1990 to 34.6/1000 persons-years in 2009–2012. tuberculosis, esophageal candidiasis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia were the most incident opportunistic illnesses in the cohort. tuberculosis had the highest incidence rate in the study period. the peak in tuberculosis incidence occurred in 1991–1993 (80.8/1000 persons-years). cerebral toxoplasmosis was the third most incident opportunistic illness in the study, with a peak of incidence of 43.6/1000 persons-year in 1987–1990. conclusions all opportunistic illnesses incidence rates decreased over the years but they still occur in an unacceptable frequency. tuberculosis co-infection among hiv-infected persists as an important challenge for health care professionals and policy makers in our setting. impressively high rates of cerebral toxoplasmosis were found suggesting that its incidence among hiv-infected is linked to the high prevalence of toxoplasma gondii infection in the general population. background:the world health organization recommends isoniazid preventive therapy (ipt) for preventing tuberculosis in hiv-infected adults, although few countries have instituted this policy. both ipt and highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) used separately result in reductions in tuberculosis risk. there is less information on the combined effect of ipt and haart. we assessed the effect of ipt, haart or both ipt and haart on tuberculosis incidence in hiv-infected adults in south africa. methods:two clinical cohorts of hiv-infected patients were studied. primary exposures were receipt of ipt and/or haart and the primary outcome was incident tuberculosis. crude incident rates and incident rate ratios were calculated and cox proportional hazards models investigated associations with tuberculosis risk. results:among 2778 hiv-infected patients followed for 4287 person-years, 267 incident tuberculosis cases were diagnosed [incidence rate ratio (irr) = 6.2/100 person-years; 95% ci 5.5–7.0]. for person-time without ipt or haart, the irr was 7.1/100 person-years (95% ci 6.2–8.2); for person-time receiving haart but without ipt, the irr was 4.6/100 person-years (95% ci 3.4–6.2); for person-time after ipt but prior to haart, the irr was 5.2/100 person-years (95% ci 3.4–7.8); during follow-up in patients treated with haart after receiving ipt the irr was 1.1/100 person-years (95% ci 0.02–7.6). compared to treatment-naive patients, haart-only patients had a 64% decreased hazard for tuberculosis [adjusted hazard ratio (ahr) = 0.36; 95% ci 0.25–0.51], and patients receiving haart after ipt had a 89% reduced hazard (ahr = 0.11; 95% ci 0.02–0.78). conclusion:tuberculosis risk is significantly reduced by ipt in haart-treated adults in a high-incidence operational setting in south africa. ipt is an inexpensive and cost-effective strategy and our data strengthen calls for the implementation of ipt in conjunction with the roll-out of haart.
the amygdaloid complex (ak) has a very important role in the modulation of endocrine and visceral functions, in complex behavioral mechanisms such as defence, feeding, aggression, affects, reproduction, memory and learning. the aim of this study was to determine the precise distribution of cannabinoid cb1 receptors in the rat ak, using the immunohistochemical (abc) method. according to our results, cb1-immunoreactivity in the rat ak was highest in the medial nucleus. slightly lower immunoreactivity was found in the basolateral nucleus. moderate density of cb1 receptors occurred in the central, basomedial, lateral and posterior nuclei of the ak. cb1-immunoreactivity in all of these nuclei was present in the form of discrete spot-like precipitates of unequal size and appearance. these precipitates exhibited three different patterns: 1. elongated columns or lines, 2. complete or incomplete rings and 3. in a small number of ak regions cb1-immunoreactivity was separately dispersed in the form of single spot-like precipitates between more complex columns and rings of precipitates. considering the functional importance of amygdala and the distribution of cb1 receptors in the ak we could conclude that our findings suggest a role for cannabinoids in modulating responses of the ak to stress and fear as well as to pain. cannabinoids are the most popular illicit drugs used for recreational purposes worldwide. however, the neurobiological substrate of their mood-altering capacity has not been elucidated so far. here we report that cb1 cannabinoid receptors are expressed at high levels in certain amygdala nuclei, especially in the lateral and basal nuclei, but are absent in other nuclei (e.g., in the central nucleus and in the medial nucleus). expression of the cb1 protein was restricted to a distinct subpopulation of gabaergic interneurons corresponding to large cholecystokinin-positive cells. detailed electron microscopic investigation revealed that cb1 receptors are located presynaptically on cholecystokinin-positive axon terminals, which establish symmetrical gabaergic synapses with their postsynaptic targets. the physiological consequence of this particular anatomical localization was investigated by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in principal cells of the lateral and basal nuclei. cb1 receptor agonists win 55,212–2 and cp 55,940 reduced the amplitude of gabaa receptor-mediated evoked and spontaneous ipscs, whereas the action potential-independent miniature ipscs were not significantly affected. in contrast, cb1 receptor agonists were ineffective in changing the amplitude of ipscs in the rat central nucleus and in the basal nucleus of cb1 knock-out mice. these results suggest that cannabinoids target specific elements in neuronal networks of given amygdala nuclei, where they presynaptically modulate gabaergic synaptic transmission. we propose that these anatomical and physiological features, characteristic of cb1 receptors in several forebrain regions, represent the neuronal substrate for endocannabinoids involved in retrograde synaptic signaling and may explain some of the emotionally relevant behavioral effects of cannabinoid exposure.
to assess pregnancy outcomes in an unselected takayasu arteritis (tak) cohort, and identify pregnancy‐related concerns. objectivestakayasu arteritis predominantly affects young women of reproductive age; therefore, the management of pregnancies with this disease is of great importance in clinical obstetrics. however, only a limited number of such cases have been reported in the english literature. our aim in this study was to investigate the clinical features of pregnant women with takayasu arteritis managed at a tertiary center in japan.methodswe conducted a retrospective study of 26 pregnancies (18 deliveries) in 10 women with takayasu arteritis, who were managed at kyushu university hospital between 1996 and 2010. data were collected retrospectively by reviewing the maternal medical records.resultsthe mean age of these patients at delivery was 29.3 ± 5.2 years. six patients had lesions above and below the diaphragm, and four patients showed isolated supradiaphragmatic disease. echocardiography was performed in all patients, and aortic regurgitation was observed in six. five pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortion, and three pregnancies were legally terminated at the patients’ request. the remaining 18 pregnancies resulted in live births. of the 18 live babies born, growth restriction was observed in 2 babies. superimposed pregnancy-induced hypertension was observed in two cases, and other severe complications, such as cerebral hemorrhage or cardiac failure did not occur.conclusionalthough takayasu arteritis is a potentially severe condition during pregnancy, successful pregnancy is possible if extreme caution is followed. blood pressure should be strictly controlled and the delivery should be planned for favorable maternal and fetal outcomes.
interferon (ifn) exerts its antiviral effects mainly through activation of a subset of ifn-stimulated genes (isg), but relatively few of fish isgs have been isolated and characterized so far. here, we report two fish isgs, termed caifi58 and caifi56, cloned from a subtractive cdna library constructed with mrnas obtained from crucian carp (carassius auratus l.) blastulae embryonic (cab) cells infected by uv-inactivated gchv and mock-infected cells. database search revealed that both isgs had a high-level homology with all members of a well conserved gene family with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (tpr) motifs, including human ifi60, ifi58, ifi56, ifi54 and their homologues in some other mammalian species. the transcripts of caifi58 and caifi56 were undetectable in cab cells but could be induced by active gchv, uv-inactivated gchv or cab ifn. analysis of expression difference between them and ifn signal factors, castat1 and cairf7, indicated that their transcriptions were mediated possibly through jak-stat signal pathway, which was further supported by the induction analysis in uv-inactivated gchv infected, ifn-treated and untreated cells in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (chx), a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. in addition, a pufferfish (fugu rubrides) dna sequence representing putative frifi56 was also revealed when caifi58 and caifi56 were used to search the pufferfish genome database. phylogenetic analysis showed that these fish isgs form a unique clad independent of mammalian homologues, reflecting a distant evolutionary relationship from mammals. these studies identified the first teleost ifi56 and ifi58 orthologues. in mammals, the response to nephrotoxicant-induced renal injury is limited to repair of the proximal tubule by surviving epithelial cells. in contrast, bony fish are capable of both repair, and de novo production of nephrons in response to renal damage. importantly, toxicant-induced nephron neogenesis in goldfish (carassius auratus) parallels nephron development in the mammalian embryo, providing a vertebrate model for kidney development. we utilized this model system to identify genes induced by the renal toxicant, gentamicin, that may function in nephron neogenesis. a novel ubiquitin-like (ubl) gene, 40.1, was identified by differential display analysis of control and gentamicin-treated goldfish kidney. 40.1 was induced dramatically 3-7 days following a sublethal dose of gentamicin, and returned to basal level by 14 days post-treatment. the induction of 40.1 coincided with early renal injury in the proximal tubules of gentamicin-injected fish; however, expression was not restricted to the kidney, suggesting that 40.1 induction may be a more general response to cell injury. sequence analysis revealed that 40.1 contains tandem ubl domains, and shares homology with isg15, a 15 kd interferon-(ifn) stimulated ubl found in mammals. analysis of the genome database for the pufferfish, fugu rubrides, identified a goldfish isg15 (gfisg15) homologue with an ifn-stimulated response element in the promoter region, providing further evidence that gfisg15 is the true teleost isg15 orthologue. zebrafish and catfish isg15 genes were subsequently identified by sequence analysis. consistent with its predicted function as a ubl, gfisg15 formed conjugates with cellular proteins in vitro and in transient transfections. similar to the induction of mammalian isg15 by microbial challenge, gfisg15 was induced in the spleen of mycobacteria-infected fish. these studies identified the first teleost isg15 orthologue. the induction of gfisg15 as an early genetic event in response to a renal toxicant, and its conserved, stress-associated, expression in higher vertebrates suggests that isg15 is an important component of the host response to diverse stress stimuli.
the decomposition rate of cwd is a key missing link for a quantitative understanding of forest ecosystem functioning. we examined factors influencing decomposition rates of bark, roots and branches from aspen (populus tremula), birch (betula pendula, b. pubescens), fir (abies sibirica), spruce (picea abies, p. obovata), scots pine (pinus sylvestris) and siberian pine (pinus sibirica) cwd in three primeval european boreal forests. the chronosequence approach with estimates of single exponential decomposition rate (k) based on calculation of mass loss was used. the k of non-stem parts increased in the order: branches (0.006 year−1 for p. sibirica and 0.020 year−1 for other species), roots in poorly drained sites (0.025 year−1), roots in well-drained sites (0.034 year−1) and bark (0.110 and 0.138 year−1 and 0.147 and 0.255 year−1 under poorly and well-drained conditions and from 1 to 3 m and >3 m above the root collar, respectively). our results predict that the rate of decomposition of whole cwd pieces in european boreal forests is a function of vegetation zone, site conditions, tree species and size. the decomposition rates and mass of fine ( 10-cm-diameter) woody detritus were measured in the dry tropical forests of the northeastern yucatan peninsula. the smallest mass of woody detritus was found in undisturbed stands: fine fractions averaged 4.7 mg ha-' and coarse fractions ranged between 13 and 38 mg ha-'. the largest mass of fine woody detritus (32.2 mg ha-') was found in a hurricane-disturbed forest; whereas, the largest mass of coarse woody detritus (99.5 mg ha-') was found in stands disturbed by catastrophic fires. a decomposition time-series study installed in 1989 indicated that decomposition rates varied greatly among species and diameters of branch segments. over a 4-year period, the decomposition rate constant for fine woody detritus ranged from 0.151 to 1.019 year-' and that for coarse woody detritus ranged from 0.008 to 0.615 year-'. the halflife of woody detritus increased 33-fold (among pieces ranging from 1 to 30 cm in diameter) for the most decayresistant species (manilkara zapota) but was relatively constant for the least decay-resistant species (bursera simaruba). the wide range in decomposition rates observed in these forests indicates that the poor substrate quality of some species may override climatic (e.g., warm temperatures) and biotic (e.g., termites) factors favorable to rapid decomposition, leading to a substantial accumulation of woody detritus.
the neurite outgrowth inhibitor, nogo-a, has been shown to be overexpressed in skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als); it is both a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. we performed a double-blind, two-part, dose-escalation study, in subjects with als, assessing safety, pharmacokinetics (pk) and functional effects of ozanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against nogo-a. in part 1, 40 subjects were randomized (3∶1) to receive single dose intravenous ozanezumab (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo. in part 2, 36 subjects were randomized (3∶1) to receive two repeat doses of intravenous ozanezumab (0.5, 2.5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo, approximately 4 weeks apart. the primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (adverse events [aes], vital signs, electrocardiogram (ecg), and clinical laboratory tests). secondary endpoints included pk, immunogenicity, functional endpoints (clinical and electrophysiological), and biomarker parameters. overall, ozanezumab treatment (0.01–15 mg/kg) was well tolerated. the overall incidence of aes in the repeat dose 2.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg ozanezumab groups was higher than in the repeat dose placebo group and repeat dose 0.5 mg/kg ozanezumab group. the majority were considered not related to study drug by the investigators. six serious aes were reported in three subjects receiving ozanezumab; none were considered related to study drug. no study drug-related patterns were identified for ecg, laboratory, or vital signs parameters. one subject (repeat dose 15 mg/kg ozanezumab) showed a weak, positive anti-ozanezumab-antibody result. pk results were generally consistent with monoclonal antibody treatments. no apparent treatment effects were observed for functional endpoints or muscle biomarkers. immunohistochemical staining showed dose-dependent co-localization of ozanezumab with nogo-a in skeletal muscle. in conclusion, single and repeat dose ozanezumab treatment was well tolerated and demonstrated co-localization at the site of action. these findings support future studies with ozanezumab in als. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov nct00875446 gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com gsk id 111330 background riluzole 100 mg probably prolongs survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by about two months and the safety of the drug is not a major concern. the evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that patients taking riluzole probably survive longer than patients taking placebo. the beneficial effects are very modest and the drug is expensive. adverse effects from riluzole are relatively minor and for the most part reversible after stopping the drug. riluzole has been approved for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in many countries but not all. questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost, modest efficacy and concern over adverse effects.   objectives to examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival.   search strategy search of the cochrane neuromuscular disease group register for randomized trials and enquiry from authors of trials, aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. the most recent search was november 2002.   selection criteria randomized trials of adults with diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), treated with riluzole or placebo. types of outcome measures: primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. secondary: per cent mortality as a function of time with riluzole 100 mg and other doses of riluzole; neurologic function, quality of life, muscle strength and adverse events.   data collection & analysis we identified four eligible randomized trials. each reviewer graded them for methodological quality. data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by two others. we obtained some missing data from investigators and regulatory agencies. we performed meta-analyses with review manager 4.1 software using a fixed effects model. a test of drug efficacy was based on the parmar pooled hazard ratio.   results the three trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 876 riluzole treated patients and 406 placebo treated patients. the data for tracheostomy-free survival was not available from the fourth trial. the methodological quality was acceptable and the three trials were easily comparable, although one trial included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (p=0.039, hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.99) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (p=0.33). when the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) is added, there is evidence of heterogeneity (p<0.0001) and the random effects model, which takes this into account results in the overall treatment effect estimate falling just short of significance (p=0.056, hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.01). this represents a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (57% in the placebo and 66% in the riluzole group). in secondary analyses of survival at separate time points, there was a significant survival advantage with riluzole 100 mg at six, nine, 12 and 15 months, but not at three or 18 months. there was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. there were no data on quality of life, but patients treated with riluzole remained in a more moderately affected health state significantly longer than placebo-treated patients (weighted mean difference 35.5 days, 95% confidence interval 5.9 to 65.0). a threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (weighted mean difference 2.69, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 4.38).   conclusions riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs survival by about two months in patients with als. more studies are needed, especially to clarify its effect in older patients (over 75 years), and those with more advanced disease.
background and aimscombination of rewetting and wetland crop cultivation (paludiculture) is pursued as a wider carbon dioxide (co2) mitigation option in drained peatland. however, information on the overall greenhouse gas (ghg) balance for paludiculture is lacking. we investigated the ghg balance of peatlands grown with reed canary grass (rcg) and rewetted to various extents.methodsgas fluxes of co2, methane (ch4) and nitrous oxide (n2o) were measured with a static chamber technique for 10 months from mesocosms sown with rcg and manipulated to ground water levels (gwl) of 0, −10, −20, −30 and −40 cm below the soil surface. gross primary production (gpp) was estimated from the above ground biomass yield.resultsthe mean dry biomass yield across all water table treatments was 6 mg ha−1 with no significant differences between the treatments. raising the gwl to the surface decreased both the net ecosystem exchange (nee) of co2 and n2o emissions whereas ch4 emissions increased. total cumulative ghg emissions (for 10 months) corresponded to 0.08, 0.13, 0.61, 0.68 and 0.98 kg co2 equivalents m−2 from the gwl treatments at 0, −10, −20, −30 and −40 cm below the soil surface, respectively.conclusionsthe results showed that a reduction in total ghg emission can be achieved without losing the productivity of newly established rcg when gwl is maintained close to the surface. further studies should address the practical constrains and long-term productivity of rcg cultivation in rewetted peatlands. northern peatland methane (ch4) budgets are important for global ch4 emissions. this study aims to determine the ecosystem ch4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. annually, roughly 70 ± 35% of ecosystem ch4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, p. arundinacea-mediated ch4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. despite of plant-dominant ch4 transport, net ch4 fluxes were low (– 0.005–0.016 μmol m−2 s−1) and annually less than 1% of the annual c-co2 assimilation. this is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased ch4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. this study shows that although ch4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than co2, is emitted from this p. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the c sequestered counterbalances the ch4 emissions to the atmosphere. it is concluded that p. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive c-sequestration ecosystem.
abstract the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas), epa and dha, as well as estrogen have been shown to decrease circulating levels of triglyceride (tg), but their underlying mode of action is unclear. the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of n-3 pufa consumption and estrogen injection on tg metabolism. rats (n = 48) were fed a modified ain-93g diet with 0, 1, or 2 % epa + dha relative to the total energy intake during 12 weeks. at 8 weeks, rats were ovariectomized (ovx), and after a 1-week recovery, rats were injected with either 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (e2) or corn oil for the last 3 weeks. the n-3 pufa consumption and e2 injection independently decreased the hepatic expressions of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, acetyl-coa carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase (fas), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (dgat2) (p < 0.05). there were interactions between n-3 pufa consumption and e2 injection on hepatic expression of fas and dgat2. in addition, n-3 pufa consumption and e2 injection up-regulated the expression of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk), phosphorylated ampk, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 in liver and skeletal muscle. e2 injection increased the expression of estrogen receptor α and β in skeletal muscle and liver, but n-3 pufa consumption increased the expression of both receptors only in skeletal muscle. the present study suggests that the hypotriglyceridemic effects of n-3 pufa consumption and e2 injection could be due to the down-regulation of hepatic tg synthesis and up-regulation of tg oxidation in liver and skeletal muscle in ovx rats. non‐technical summary  previous studies show that oestrogen is beneficial for maintaining blood glucose levels and helping the body respond to insulin. despite these previous findings, the mechanism by which oestrogen acts is unknown. we show that specific activation of oestrogen receptor α (erα) increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle when insulin is present. activation of oestrogen receptor β (erβ) alone or activation of both erα and erβ together did not increase glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. this suggests that oestrogen's beneficial effect occurs by activating erα. these results have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of glucose homeostasis, particularly in postmenopausal women with low oestrogen levels.
perisomatic gabaergic synapses onto hippocampal pyramidal cells arise from two populations of basket cells with different neurochemical and functional properties. the presence of the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex in their postsynaptic density (psd) distinguishes perisomatic synapses from gabaergic synapses on dendrites and the axon-initial segment. targeted deletion of neuroligin 2 (nl2), a transmembrane protein interacting with presynaptic neurexin, has been reported to disrupt postsynaptic clustering of gabaa receptors (gabaar) and their anchoring protein, gephyrin, at perisomatic synapses. in contrast, targeted deletion of gabra2 disrupts perisomatic clustering of gephyrin, but not of α1-gabaar, nl2, or dystrophin/dystroglycan. unexpectedly, conditional deletion of dag1, encoding dystroglycan, selectively prevents the formation of perisomatic gabaergic synapses from basket cells expressing cholecystokinin. collectively, these observations suggest that multiple mechanisms regulate formation and molecular composition of the gabaergic psd at perisomatic synapses. here, we further explored this issue by investigating the effect of targeted deletion of gabra1 and nl2 on the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex and on perisomatic synapse formation, using immunofluorescence analysis with a battery of gabaergic pre- and postsynaptic markers. we show that the absence of α1-gabaar increases gabaergic synapses containing the α2 subunit, without affecting the clustering of dystrophin and nl2; in contrast, the absence of nl2 produces highly variable effects postsynaptically, not restricted to perisomatic synapses and being more severe for the gabaar subunits and gephyrin than dystrophin. altogether, the results confirm the importance of nl2 as organizer of the gabaergic psd and unravel distinct roles for α1- and α2-gabaars in the formation of gabaergic circuits in close interaction with the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex. synaptic scaffolding molecule (s‐scam) is a synaptic protein, which harbors five or six psd‐95/discs large/zo‐1 (pdz), a guanylate kinase and two ww domains. it interacts with nmda receptor subunits, neuroligin and β‐catenin, and is involved in the accumulation of neuroligin at excitatory synapses. in this study, we have demonstrated s‐scam is localized at inhibitory synapses in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons. we have identified β‐dystroglycan (β‐dg) as a binding partner for s‐scam at inhibitory synapses. ww domains of s‐scam bind to three sequences of β‐dg. we have also revealed that s‐scam can interact with neuroligin 2, which is known to be exclusively localized at inhibitory synapses. the ww domains and the second pdz domain of s‐scam are involved in the interaction with neuroligin 2. β‐dg, neuroligin 2 and s‐scam form a tripartite complex in vitro. neuroligin 2 is detected in the immunoprecipitates by anti‐β‐dg antibody from rat brain. s‐scam, β‐dg and neuroligin 2 are partially co‐localized in rat hippocampal neurons. these data suggest that s‐scam is associated with β‐dg and neuroligin 2 at inhibitory synapses, and functions as a linker between the dystrophin glycoprotein complex and the neurexin–neuroligin complex.
backgroundthe mosquito aedes aegypti has long been a vector for human illness in the southeastern united states. in the past, it has been responsible for outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever and, very recently, the zika virus that has been introduced to the region. multiple studies have modeled the geographic distribution of ae. aegypti as a function of climate factors; however, this ignores the importance of humans to the anthropophilic biter. furthermore, ae. aegypti thrives in areas where humans have created standing water sites, such as water storage containers and trash. as models are developed to examine the potential impact of climate change, it becomes increasingly important to include the most comprehensive set of predictors possible.resultsthis study uses maxent, a species distribution model, to evaluate the effects of adding poverty and population density to climate-only models. performance was evaluated through model fit statistics, such as auc, omission, and commission, as well as individual variable contributions and response curves. models which included both population density and poverty exhibited better predictive power and produced more precise distribution maps. furthermore, the two human population characteristics accounted for much of the model contribution—more so than climate variables.conclusionsmodeling mosquito distributions without accounting for their dependence on local human populations may miss factors that are very important to niche realization and subsequent risk of infection for humans. further research is needed to determine if additional human characteristics should be evaluated for model inclusion. abstract   after more than a half century without recognized local dengue outbreaks in the continental united states, there were recent outbreaks of autochthonous dengue in the southern parts of texas (2004–2005) and florida (2009–2011). this dengue reemergence has provoked interest in the extent of the future threat posed by the yellow fever mosquito, aedes (stegomyia) aegypti (l.), the primary vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses in urban settings, to human health in the continental united states. ae. aegypti is an intriguing example of a vector species that not only occurs in the southernmost portions of the eastern united states today but also is incriminated as the likely primary vector in historical outbreaks of yellow fever as far north as new york, philadelphia, and boston, from the 1690s to the 1820s. for vector species with geographic ranges limited, in part, by low temperature and cool range margins occurring in the southern part of the continental united states, as is currently the case for ae. aegypti, it is tempting to speculate that climate warming may result in a northward range expansion (similar to that seen for ixodes tick vectors of lyme borreliosis spirochetes in scandinavia and southern canada in recent decades). although there is no doubt that climate conditions directly impact many aspects of the life history of ae. aegypti, this mosquito also is closely linked to the human environment and directly influenced by the availability of water-holding containers for oviposition and larval development. competition with other container-inhabiting mosquito species, particularly aedes (stegomyia) albopictus (skuse), also may impact the presence and local abundance of ae. aegypti. field-based studies that focus solely on the impact of weather or climate factors on the presence and abundance of ae. aegypti, including assessments of the potential impact of climate warming on the mosquito's future range and abundance, do not consider the potential confounding effects of socioeconomic factors or biological competitors for establishment and proliferation of ae. aegypti. the results of such studies therefore should not be assumed to apply in areas with different socioeconomic conditions or composition of container-inhabiting mosquito species. for example, results from field-based studies at the high altitude cool margins for ae. aegypti in mexico's central highlands or the andes in south america cannot be assumed to be directly applicable to geographic areas in the united states with comparable climate conditions. unfortunately, we have a very poor understanding of how climatic drivers interact with the human landscape and biological competitors to impact establishment and proliferation of ae. aegypti at the cool margin of its range in the continental united states. a first step toward assessing the future threat this mosquito poses to human health in the continental united states is to design and conduct studies across strategic climatic and socioeconomic gradients in the united states (including the u.s.-mexico border area) to determine the permissiveness of the coupled natural and human environment for ae. aegypti at the present time. this approach will require experimental studies and field surveys that focus specifically on climate conditions relevant to the continental united states. these studies also must include assessments of how the human landscape, particularly the impact of availability of larval developmental sites and the permissiveness of homes for mosquito intrusion, and the presence of other container-inhabiting mosquitoes that may compete with ae. aegypti for larval habitat affects the ability of ae. aegypti to establish and proliferate. until we are armed with such knowledge, it is not possible to meaningfully assess the potential for climate warming to impact the proliferation potential for ae. aegypti in the united states outside of the geographic areas where the mosquito already is firmly established, and even less so for dengue virus transmission and dengue disease in humans.
calcium-calmodulin/dependent protein kinase ii (camkii), amp-activated protein kinase (ampk), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk1/2) have each been implicated in the regulation of substrate metabolism during exercise. the purpose of this study was to determine whether camkii is involved in the regulation of fa uptake and oxidation and, if it is involved, whether it does so independently of ampk and erk1/2. rat hindquarters were perfused at rest with (n = 16) or without (n = 10) 3 mm caffeine, or during electrical stimulation (n = 14). for each condition, rats were subdivided and treated with 10 mum of either kn92 or kn93, inactive and active camkii inhibitors, respectively. both caffeine treatment and electrical stimulation significantly increased fa uptake and oxidation. kn93 abolished caffeine-induced fa uptake, decreased contraction-induced fa uptake by 33%, and abolished both caffeine- and contraction-induced fa oxidation (p < 0.05). caffeine had no effect on erk1/2 phosphorylation (p > 0.05) and increased alpha(2)-ampk activity by 68% (p < 0.05). electrical stimulation increased erk1/2 phosphorylation and alpha(2)-ampk activity by 51% and 3.4-fold, respectively (p < 0.05). kn93 had no effect on caffeine-induced alpha(2)-ampk activity, erk1/2 phosphorylation, or contraction-induced erk1/2 phosphorylation (p > 0.05). alternatively, it decreased contraction-induced alpha(2)-ampk activity by 51% (p < 0.05), suggesting that camkii lies upstream of ampk. these results demonstrate that regulation of contraction-induced fa uptake and oxidation occurs in part via ca(2+)-independent activation of erk1/2 as well as ca(2+)-dependent activation of camkii and ampk. intramuscular triacylglycerol is an important energy store and is also related to insulin resistance. the mobilization of fatty acids from this pool is probably regulated by hormone-sensitive lipase (hsl), which has recently been shown to exist in muscle and to be activated by both adrenaline and contractions. adrenaline acts via camp-dependent protein kinase (pka). the signalling mediating the effect of contractions is unknown and was explored in this study. incubated soleus muscles from 70 g male rats were electrically stimulated to perform repeated tetanic contractions for 5 min. the contraction-induced activation of hsl was abolished by the protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide i and calphostin c and reduced 50% by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor u0126, which also completely blocked extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1 and 2 phosphorylation. none of the inhibitors reduced adrenaline-induced hsl activation in soleus muscle. both phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (pma), which activates pkc and, in turn, erk, and caffeine, which increases intracellular ca2+ without eliciting contraction, increased hsl activity. activated erk increased hsl activity in supernatant from basal but not from electrically stimulated muscle. in conclusion, in muscle, pkc can stimulate hsl through erk. contractions and adrenaline enhance muscle hsl activity by different signalling mechanisms. the effect of contractions is mediated by pkc, at least partly via the erk pathway.
malassezia is a unique lipophilic genus in class malasseziomycetes in ustilaginomycotina, (basidiomycota, fungi) that otherwise consists almost exclusively of plant pathogens. malassezia are typically isolated from warm-blooded animals, are dominant members of the human skin mycobiome and are associated with common skin disorders. to characterize the genetic basis of the unique phenotypes of malassezia spp., we sequenced the genomes of all 14 accepted species and used comparative genomics against a broad panel of fungal genomes to comprehensively identify distinct features that define the malassezia gene repertoire: gene gain and loss; selection signatures; and lineage-specific gene family expansions. our analysis revealed key gene gain events (64) with a single gene conserved across all malassezia but absent in all other sequenced basidiomycota. these likely horizontally transferred genes provide intriguing gain-of-function events and prime candidates to explain the emergence of malassezia. a larger set of genes (741) were lost, with enrichment for glycosyl hydrolases and carbohydrate metabolism, concordant with adaptation to skin’s carbohydrate-deficient environment. gene family analysis revealed extensive turnover and underlined the importance of secretory lipases, phospholipases, aspartyl proteases, and other peptidases. combining genomic analysis with a re-evaluation of culture characteristics, we establish the likely lipid-dependence of all malassezia. our phylogenetic analysis sheds new light on the relationship between malassezia and other members of ustilaginomycotina, as well as phylogenetic lineages within the genus. overall, our study provides a unique genomic resource for understanding malassezia niche-specificity and potential virulence, as well as their abundance and distribution in the environment and on human skin. ustilaginomycotina (basidiomycota, fungi) has been reclassified recently based on multiple gene sequence analyses. however, the phylogenetic placement of two yeast-like genera malassezia and moniliella in the subphylum remains unclear. phylogenetic analyses using different algorithms based on the sequences of six genes, including the small subunit (18s) ribosomal dna (rdna), the large subunit (26s) rdna d1/d2 domains, the internal transcribed spacer regions (its 1 and 2) including 5.8s rdna, the two subunits of rna polymerase ii (rpb1 and rpb2) and the translation elongation factor 1-α (ef1-α), were performed to address their phylogenetic positions. our analyses indicated that malassezia and moniliella represented two deeply rooted lineages within ustilaginomycotina and have a sister relationship to both ustilaginomycetes and exobasidiomycetes. those clades are described here as new classes, namely moniliellomycetes with order moniliellales, family moniliellaceae, and genus moniliella; and malasseziomycetes with order malasseziales, family malasseziaceae, and genus malassezia. phenotypic differences support this classification suggesting widely different life styles among the mainly plant pathogenic ustilaginomycotina.
electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 healthy subjects (students) in the state of rest with eyes open and during memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (the latin and russian languages) and retrieval of information from memory (control). the estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared for the following frequency bands: θ (4–7 hz), α1 (7–10 hz), α2 (10–13 hz), β1 (13–18 hz), β2 (18–30 hz), and γ (30–40 hz). compared to the state of rest, the decrease in coherence in the pairs of derivations from the frontal and central cortical areas in all eeg frequency bands was the most pronounced for memorization, and the increase in coherence in the interhemispheric derivation pairs of the parietal-occipital region in most of the frequency bands was the most pronounced for retrieval. in addition, in the pairs formed by derivations from the parietal-occipital region with derivations from the frontal and central regions, retrieval is also characterized by an increase in coherence in the β2 and γ bands along with its decrease in the low-frequency ranges. the dynamics of eeg coherence, when comparing the states of memorization and retrieval, is more statistically significant in the interhemispheric and cross-hemispheric pairs of derivations than in the intrahemispheric pairs. the revealed topographic specificity of the dynamics of eeg coherence owing to the change of state is considered in terms of the notion on cognitive-specific forms of sustained goal-directed mental attention. electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 subjects (students) in states of: rest with the eyes open; memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (latin and russian); and recollection (control) of the memorized information. estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared using statistical methods for the frequency bands θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ. the results of this comparison showed that transition from the state of rest to those of memorization and recollection was accompanied by numerous changes in coherence in all the frequency bands. these changes varied in intensity and embrace practically the entire convexital cerebral cortex. decrease in eeg coherence was predominant during the transition to the memorization state in various frequency bands, whereas during the transition from the rest state to that of recollection, eeg coherence increased in most of the frequency bands except for the band α2. the reproducibility of this pattern of changes in eeg coherence is confirmed by the results in the subgroups formed by randomly subdividing the subjects into two groups. we think that the observed intense rearrangement of the spatial synchronization of the cortex electrical activity reflects the reorganization of the functional systems of neuronal ensembles to provide efficient memorization and recollection, respectively.
the authors performed this study to determine the accuracy of several text classification methods to categorize wrist x-ray reports. we randomly sampled 751 textual wrist x-ray reports. two expert reviewers rated the presence (n = 301) or absence (n = 450) of an acute fracture of wrist. we developed two information retrieval (ir) text classification methods and a machine learning method using a support vector machine (tc-1). in cross-validation on the derivation set (n = 493), tc-1 outperformed the two ir based methods and six benchmark classifiers, including naive bayes and a neural network. in the validation set (n = 258), tc-1 demonstrated consistent performance with 93.8% accuracy; 95.5% sensitivity; 92.9% specificity; and 87.5% positive predictive value. tc-1 was easy to implement and superior in performance to the other classification methods. 1. what's it all about? 2. input: concepts, instances, attributes 3. output: knowledge representation 4. algorithms: the basic methods 5. credibility: evaluating what's been learned 6. implementations: real machine learning schemes 7. moving on: engineering the input and output 8. nuts and bolts: machine learning algorithms in java 9. looking forward
three experiments were conducted with right-handed participants to examine between-trial inhibition and facilitation effects in goal-directed aiming. participants were required to execute rapid left-hand or right-hand aiming movements upon illumination of a target light in left or right space. thus, from trial to trial, participants executed movements to either the same target location or a different target location with the either same hand or the other hand. our reaction time results indicated that participants were particularly slow in initiating their movements when they were required to return to the same target location with the other hand. this was especially the case when the right hand was required to move to a target just occupied by the left hand. for both reaction time and movement time the right hand but not the left hand exhibited an advantage when it was required to perform the same movement two times in a row. taken together these results suggest that inhibition of return, in a target-target paradigm, is more associated with the particular spatial location of the target than the organization of a specific movement to that location. moreover, the between-trial facilitation observed for the right hand may reflect the ability of the left cerebral hemisphere to maintain an already parameterized motor program over a short intertrial interval. consistent with action–based theories of attention, the presence of a nontarget stimulus in the environment has been shown to alter the characteristics of goal–directed movements. specifically, it has been reported that movement trajectories veer away from (howard & tipper, 1997) or towards (welsh, elliott, & weeks, 1999) the location of a nontarget stimulus. the purpose of the experiments reported in this paper was to test a response activation model of selective reaching conceived to account for these variable results. in agreement with the model, the trajectory changes in the movements appear to be determined by the activation levels of each competing response at the moment of response initiation. the results of the present work, as well as those of previous studies, are discussed within the framework of the model of response activation.
the increase in vehicle accidents due to the driver drowsiness over the last years highlights the need for developing reliable drowsiness assistant systems by a reference drowsiness measure. therefore, the thesis at hand is aimed at classifying the driver vigilance state based on eye movements using electrooculography (eog). in order to give an insight into the states of driving, which lead to critical safety situations, first, driver drowsiness, distraction and different terminologies in this context are described. afterwards, countermeasures as techniques for keeping a driver awake and consequently preventing car crashes are reviewed. since countermeasures do not have a long-lasting effect on the driver vigilance, intelligent driver drowsiness detection systems are needed. in the recent past, such systems have been developed on the market, some of which are introduced in this study. as also stated in previous studies, driver state is quantifiable by objective and subjective measures. the objective measures monitor the driver either directly or indirectly. for indirect monitoring of the driver, one uses the driving performance measures such as the lane keeping behavior or steering wheel movements. on the contrary, direct monitoring mainly comprises the driver’s physiological measures such as the brain activities, heart rate and eye movements. in order to assess these objective measures, subjective measures such as self-rating scores are required. this study introduces these measures and discusses the concerns about their interpretation and reliability. the developed drowsiness assistant systems on the market are all based on driving performance measures. these measures presuppose that the vehicle is steered solely by the driver himself. as long as other assistance systems with the concept to keep the vehicle in the middle of the lane are activated, driving performance measures would make wrong decisions about warnings. the reason is what the sensors measure is a combination of the driver’s behavior and the activated assistance system. in fact, the drowsiness warning system cannot determine the contribution of the driver in the driving task. this underscores the need for the direct monitoring of the driver. previous works have introduced the drop of the alpha spindle rate (asr) as a drowsiness indicator. this rate is a feature extracted out of the brain activity signals during the direct monitoring the driver. additionally, asr was shown to be sensitive to driver distraction, especially a visual one with an counteracting effect. we develop an algorithm based on eye movements to reduce the negative effect of the driver visual distraction on the asr. this helps to partially improve the association of asr with the driver drowsiness. since the focus of this study is on driver eye movements, we introduce the human visual system and describe the idea of what and where to define the visual attention. further, the structure of the human eye and relevant types of eye movements during driving are defined. we also categorize eye movements into two groups of slow and fast eye movements. we show that blinks, in principle, can belong to both of these groups depending on the driver’s vigilance state. eog as a tool to measure the driver eye movements allows us to distinguish between drowsinessor distraction-related and driving situation dependent eye movements. thus, in a pilot study, xvi abstract an experiment under fully controlled conditions is carried out on a proving ground to investigate the relationship between driver eye movements and different real driving scenarios. in this experiment, unwanted head vibrations within eog signals and the sawtooth pattern (optokinetic nystagmus, okn) of eyes are realized as situation dependent eye movements. the former occurs due to ground excitation and the latter happens during small radius (50m) curve negotiation. the statistical investigation expresses a significant variation of eog due to unwanted head vibrations. moreover, an analytical model is developed to explain the possible relationship of okn and tangent point of the curve. the developed model is validated against the real data on a high curvature track. in order to cover all relevant eye movement patterns during awake and drowsy driving, different experiments are conducted in this work including daytime and nighttime experiments under real road and simulated driving conditions. based on the measured signals in the experiments, we study different eye movement detection approaches. we, first, investigate the conventional blink detection method based on the median filtering and show its drawback in detecting slow blinks and saccades. afterwards, an adaptive detection approach is proposed based on the derivative of the eog signal to simultaneously detect not only the eye blinks, but also other driving-relevant eye movements such as saccades and microsleep events. moreover, in spite of the fact that drowsiness influences eye movement patterns, the proposed algorithm distinguishes between the often confused driving-related saccades and decreased amplitude blinks of a drowsy driver. the evaluation of results shows that the presented detection algorithm outperforms the common method based on median filtering so that fast eye movements are detected correctly during both awake and drowsy phases. further, we address the detection of slower eye blinks, which are referred to as typical patterns of the drowsiness, by applying the continuous wavelet transform to eog signals. in our proposed algorithm, by adjusting parameters of the wavelet transform, fast and slow blinks are detected simultaneously. however, this approach suffers from a larger false detection rate in comparison to the derivative-based method. as a result, for blink detection in this work, a combination of these two methods is applied. to improve the quality of the collected eog signals, the discrete wavelet transform is benefited to remove noise and drift. for the noise removal, an adaptive thresholding strategy within the discrete wavelet transform is proposed which avoids sacrificing noise removal for saving blink amplitude or vice versa. in previous research, driver eye blink features (blink frequency, duration, etc.) have shown to be correlated to some extent with drowsiness. hence, within a level of uncertainty they can contribute to driver drowsiness warning systems. in order to improve such systems, we investigate characteristics of detected blinks with respect to their different origins. we observed that in a real road experiment, blinks occur both spontaneously or due to gaze shifts. gaze shifts between fixed positions, which occurred due to secondary visuomotor task, induced and modulated the occurrence of blinks. moreover, the direction of the gaze shifts affected the occurrence of such blinks. based on the eye movements during another experiment in a driving simulator without a secondary task, we found that the amount of gaze shifts (between various positions) is positively correlated with the probability of the blink occurrence. therefore, we recommend handling gaze shift-induced blinks (e.g. during visual distraction) differently from those occurring spontaneously in drowsiness warning systems that rely solely on the variation of blink frequency as a driver state indicator. after studying dependencies between blink occurrence and gaze shifts, we extract 19 features out of each detected blink event of 43 subjects collected under both simulated and real driving abstract xvii conditions during 67 hours of both daytime and nighttime driving. this corresponds to the largest number of extracted eye blink features and the largest number of subjects among previous studies. we propose two approaches for aggregating features to improve their association with the slowly evolving drowsiness. in the first approach, we solely investigate parts of the collected data which are best correlated with the subjective self-rating score, i.e. karolinska sleepiness scale. in the second approach, however, the entire data set with the maximum amount of information regarding driver drowsiness is scrutinized. for both approaches, the dependency between single features and drowsiness is studied statistically using correlation coefficients. the results show that the drowsiness dependency to features evolves to a larger extent non-linearly rather than linearly. moreover, we show that for some features, different trends with respect to drowsiness are possible among different subjects. consequently, we challenge warning systems which rely only on a single feature for their decision strategy and underscore that they are prone to high false alarm rates. in order to study whether a single feature is suitable for predicting safety-critical events, we study the overall variation of the features for all subjects shortly before the occurrence of the first unintentional lane departure and first unintentional microsleep in comparison to the beginning of the drive. based on statistical tests, before the lane departure, most of the features change significantly. therefore, we justify the role of blink features for the early driver drowsiness detection. however, this is not valid for the variation of features before the microsleep. we also focus on all 19 blink-based features together as one set. we assess the driver state by artificial neural network, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors classifiers for both binary and multi-class cases. there, binary classifiers are trained both subject-independent and subject-dependent to address the generalization aspects of the results for unseen data. for the binary driver state prediction (awake vs. drowsy) using blink features, we have attained an average detection rate of 83% for each classifier separately. for 3-class classification (awake vs. medium vs. drowsy), however, the result was only 67%, possibly due to inaccurate self-rated vigilance st in this work, we investigate eye movement analysis as a new sensing modality for activity recognition. eye movement data were recorded using an electrooculography (eog) system. we first describe and evaluate algorithms for detecting three eye movement characteristics from eog signals-saccades, fixations, and blinks-and propose a method for assessing repetitive patterns of eye movements. we then devise 90 different features based on these characteristics and select a subset of them using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mrmr) feature selection. we validate the method using an eight participant study in an office environment using an example set of five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking handwritten notes, watching a video, and browsing the web. we also include periods with no specific activity (the null class). using a support vector machine (svm) classifier and person-independent (leave-one-person-out) training, we obtain an average precision of 76.1 percent and recall of 70.5 percent over all classes and participants. the work demonstrates the promise of eye-based activity recognition (ear) and opens up discussion on the wider applicability of ear to other activities that are difficult, or even impossible, to detect using common sensing modalities.
environmental factors governing the distributions of plant root-associated bacteria are poorly understood. most plant species occurring in salt marsh estuaries are restricted to very specific habitats within the marsh and plant-derived and abiotic environmental features covary. we examined diazotrophic bacteria inhabiting the rhizoplanes of different populations of the black needlerush, juncus roemerianus, growing in two different habitats, in order to examine the relative influence of plant-derived and abiotic environmental parameters on diazotroph assemblage composition. juncus roots were collected from a monotypic juncus patch in the low intertidal marsh, and from the main monotypic juncus stand in the high marsh. a total of 235 bacterial pure cultures were isolated from the roots using combined nitrogen-free media. physiologically similar strains were grouped, producing 58 different groups. strains representing 49 of these groups tested positive for nifh, and substrate utilization profiles of these strains were compared quantitatively. three major substrate utilization clusters were identified and all contained both juncus patch and main stand isolates. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of nifh amplicons recovered from roots and from vegetated sediments taken from the main stand and from two patches was also performed. juncus root nifh amplicon profiles from all three sampling sites were very similar. profiles of amplicons from vegetated sediments were also similar across sites, but less similar than the root profiles. results from two independent methodological approaches indicated a strong impact of the plant host relative to that of the abiotic environment on the composition of the root-associated diazotroph assemblage. the degree of host specificity of most plant root associated bacteria is poorly under- stood. in this study we examined the physiological diversity of oxygen utilizing, culturable dia- zotrophs from the rhizoplane of the high marsh perennial glasswort salicornia virginica and com- pared them to diazotrophs from other salt marsh plants (tall and short spartina alterniflora, juncus roemerianus, and spartina patens) from the same ecosystem. forty-six pure culture strains were recovered from the rhizoplane of s. virginica by stab inoculating freshly collected roots into com- bined nitrogen-free semi-solid media, followed by streak plating of clonal outgrowths. the majority of these strains were gram-negative obligately aerobic or microaerophilic rods, but 3 gram-positive strains were also isolated and characterized. api 20ne test strips were used for preliminary charac- terization of all strains, yielding 22 physiologically different api strain groups. one representative strain was selected from each api group and tested for the presence of nifh, denoting strains capa- ble of n2-fixation. seventeen strains (14 gram-negative, 3 gram-positive) were nifh-positive and were characterized further using biolog test plates. four well-supported strain clusters were iden- tified by bootstrapped cluster analysis of the biolog substrate utilization profiles. these clusters differed in utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and amino acids. s. virginica diazotrophs were physiologically quite different from rhizoplane diazotrophs from the low marsh plants s. alterni- flora and j. roemerianus, but much more similar to diazotrophs from another high marsh plant, s. patens. we hypothesize that the observed physiological differentiation between high marsh and low marsh diazotrophs reflects differences in selection pressures in the rhizoplane microenvironment produced by plants with differing abilities to ventilate the rhizosphere. in addition, high and low marsh branches were further resolved into host-specific strain clusters, which also implies a strong impact of other host features, such as the suite of carbon exudate compounds produced, on the dis- tributions of specific diazotroph strains. these findings imply endemic, host-specific distributions of salt marsh diazotrophs and are consistent with the great diversity of diazotrophs that have been observed in this ecosystem to date.
purpose to investigate the safety and initial efficacy of xtract, a power aspiration-based extraction technique for treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolism with the use of the penumbra/indigo system.   materials and methods a total of 79 patients were enrolled: 39 (49.4%) underwent xtract as the initial therapy and 40 (50.6%) underwent xtract after failed catheter-directed thrombolysis or other mechanical intervention or for removal of distal emboli that occurred during an intervention. occlusion locations were as follows: 36.7% (n = 29) in the profunda, common, or superficial femoral artery; 35.4% (n = 28) in the popliteal artery; 15.2% (n = 12) in the tibial artery; 7.6% (n = 6) in the peroneal artery; and the remainder in the common iliac (n = 1), external iliac (n = 1), sciatic (n = 1), and brachial (n = 1) arteries.   results complete or near-complete revascularization (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction [timi] grade 2/3 flow) was achieved in 87.2% of patients (68 of 78) immediately after the xtract procedure and before any other intervention. successful revascularization was achieved in 79.5% of patients (31 of 39) as an initial treatment and in 92.5% (37 of 40) as salvage or secondary therapy. after additional adjunctive endovascular interventions, timi grade 2/3 flow was achieved in 96.2% of patients (76 of 79). complete thrombus removal and restoration of normal flow (timi grade 3) was achieved in 77.2% of patients (61 of 79) after all endovascular treatment was completed. no patients required surgical revascularization. no device-related adverse events occurred.   conclusions xtract was safe and effective for revascularization of acute or subacute peripheral arterial occlusions as a primary therapy or as a secondary therapy after other endovascular techniques had failed. background recent controlled trials suggest that thrombolytic therapy may be an effective initial treatment for acute arterial occlusion of the legs. a major potential benefit of initial thrombolytic therapy is that limb ischemia can be managed with less invasive interventions.   methods in this randomized, multicenter trial conducted at 113 north american and european sites, we compared vascular surgery (e.g., thrombectomy or bypass surgery) with thrombolysis by catheter-directed intraarterial recombinant urokinase; all patients (272 per group) had had acute arterial obstruction of the legs for 14 days or less. infusions were limited to a period of 48 hours (mean [+/-se], 24.4+/-0.86), after which lesions were corrected by surgery or angioplasty if needed. the primary end point was the amputation-free survival rate at six months.   results final angiograms, which were available for 246 patients treated with urokinase, revealed recanalization in 196 (79.7 percent) and complete dissolution of thrombus in 167 (67.9 percent). both treatment groups had similar significant improvements in mean ankle-brachial blood-pressure index. amputation-free survival rates in the urokinase group were 71.8 percent at six months and 65.0 percent at one year, as compared with respective rates of 74.8 percent and 69.9 percent in the surgery group; the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences were -10.5 to 4.5 percentage points at six months (p=0.43) and -12.9 to 3.1 percentage points at one year (p=0.23). at six months the surgery group had undergone 551 open operative procedures (excluding amputations), as compared with 315 in the thrombolysis group. major hemorrhage occurred in 32 patients in the urokinase group (12.5 percent) as compared with 14 patients in the surgery group (5.5 percent) (p= 0.005). there were four episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the urokinase group (1.6 percent), one of which was fatal. by contrast, there were no episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the surgery group.   conclusions despite its association with a higher frequency of hemorrhagic complications, intraarterial infusion of urokinase reduced the need for open surgical procedures, with no significantly increased risk of amputation or death.
backgroundpropionic acid is used primarily as a food preservative with smaller applications as a chemical building block for the production of many products including fabrics, cosmetics, drugs, and plastics. biological production using propionibacteria would be competitive against chemical production through hydrocarboxylation of ethylene if native producers could be engineered to reach near-theoretical yield and good productivity. unfortunately, engineering propionibacteria has proven very challenging. it has been suggested that activation of the sleeping beauty operon in escherichia coli is sufficient to achieve propionic acid production. optimising e. coli production should be much easier than engineering propionibacteria if tolerance issues can be addressed.resultspropionic acid is produced in e. coli via the sleeping beauty mutase operon under anaerobic conditions in rich medium via amino acid degradation. we observed that the sbm operon enhances amino acids degradation to propionic acid and allows e. coli to degrade isoleucine. however, we show here that the operon lacks an epimerase reaction that enables propionic acid production in minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source. production from glucose can be restored by engineering the system with a methylmalonyl-coa epimerase from propionibacterium acidipropionici (0.23 ± 0.02 mm). 1-propanol production was also detected from the promiscuous activity of the native alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe). we also show that aerobic conditions are favourable for propionic acid production. finally, we increase titre 65 times using a combination of promoter engineering and process optimisation.conclusionsthe native sbm operon encodes an incomplete pathway. production of propionic acid from glucose as sole carbon source is possible when the pathway is complemented with a methylmalonyl-coa epimerase. although propionic acid via the restored succinate dissimilation pathway is considered a fermentative process, the engineered pathway was shown to be functional under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. pantothenate kinase catalyzes the rate-controlling step in the coenzyme a (coa) biosynthetic pathway, and its activity is modulated by the size of the coa pool. the effect of nonesterified coa (coash) and coa thioesters on the activity of pantothenate kinase was examined to determine which component of the coa pool is the most effective regulator of the enzyme from escherichia coli. coash was five times more potent than acetyl-coa or other coa thioesters as an inhibitor of pantothenate kinase activity in vitro. inhibition by coa thioesters was not due to their hydrolysis to coash. coash inhibition was competitive with respect to atp, thus providing a mechanism to coordinate coa production with the energy state of the cell. there were considerable differences in the size and composition of the coa pool in cells grown on different carbon sources, and a carbon source shift experiment was used to test the inhibitory effect of the different coa species in vivo. a shift from glucose to acetate as the carbon source resulted in an increase in the coash:acetyl-coa ratio from 0.7 to 4.3. the alteration in the coa pool composition was associated with the selective inhibition of pantothenate phosphorylation, consistent with coash being a more potent regulator of pantothenate kinase activity in vivo. these results demonstrate that coa biosynthesis is regulated through feedback inhibition of pantothenate kinase primarily by the concentration of coash and secondarily by the size of the coa thioester pool.
objectivein order to define the predictors of prolonged survival available at the time of first examination we performed a historical cohort study of amyotrophis sclerosis (als) patients referred to our als clinic over the last 20 years.methodsin a group of 1034 patients with the diagnosis of definite or probable als the effects of individual prognostic factors on tracheostomy-free survival were assessed with the kaplan-meier life-table method. the prognostic value of each factor was estimated using univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard analyses.resultsthe median survival time was 3.45 years, (95%ci 3.27–3.74). both the univariate and multivariate cox models indicated that younger age, limb site of onset, longer diagnostic delay, lower appel als score (aalss) at first examination, lower aalss-rate of change between first symptom and first exam (preslope), and higher baseline forced vital capacity (fvc) were associated with longer survival. in addition, four factors: age, diagnostic delay, baseline fvc and aalss preslope have been identified as independent predictors of survival in our patient population.conclusionsthe identification of younger age, limb site of onset and longer diagnostic delay as predictors of prolonged survival in als clinic population supports the findings of several, earlier studies that were based on smaller groups of patients. more significantly, several additional variables assessed at the first examination predict longer survival: lower baseline aalss, lower aalss- preslope and higher baseline fvc. all of these parameters are of value in patient management and in clinical trial development. the scottish motor neuron disease register (smndr) is a prospective, collaborative, population-based project which has been collecting data on incident patients since 1989. in this report we present the clinical features of 229 patients with motor neuron disease (218 sporadic and 11 familial) diagnosed in 1989 and 1990 and compare their prognosis with previous studies of survival. the overall 50% survival from symptom onset was 2.5 years (95% ci, 2.2–3.0) and 5-year survival 28% (95% cl, 20–36%). the presence of progressive bulbar palsy (pbp), either at presentation or developing during the course of the illness, significantly reduced survival and was the most important prognostic indicator. patients who survived longer than 5 years from symptom onset did not have bp as part of their presenting illness. the prognosis was worse for women, and this was in part related to the higher frequency of pbp in older women, but age was also an independent adverse risk factor. differences in survival between this and previous series can probably be explained on the basis of variation in case definition and ascertainment methods.
background low-frequency (delta/theta) oscillations in the thalamocortical system are elevated in schizophrenia during wakefulness and are also induced in the n-methyl-d-asparate receptor hypofunction rat model. to determine whether abnormal delta oscillations might produce functional deficits, we used optogenetic methods in awake rats. we illuminated channelrhodopsin-2 in the thalamic nucleus reuniens (re) at delta frequency and measured the effect on working memory (wm) performance (the re is involved in wm, a process affected in schizophrenia [sz]).   methods we injected re with adeno-associated virus to transduce cells with channelrhodopsin-2. an optical fiber was implanted just dorsal to the hippocampus in order to illuminate re axon terminals.   results during optogenetic delta frequency stimulation, rats displayed a strong wm deficit. on the following day, performance was normal if illumination was omitted.   conclusions the optogenetic experiments show that delta frequency stimulation of a thalamic nucleus is sufficient to produce deficits in wm. this result supports the hypothesis that delta frequency bursting in particular thalamic nuclei has a causal role in producing wm deficits in sz. the action potentials in these bursts may "jam" communication through the thalamus, thereby interfering with behaviors dependent on wm. studies in thalamic slices using the n-methyl-d-asparate receptor hypofunction model show that delta frequency bursting is dependent on t-type ca(2+) channels, a result that we confirmed here in vivo. these channels, which are strongly implicated in sz by genome-wide association studies, may thus be a therapeutic target for treatment of sz. phencyclidine (pcp), ketamine (special k), and mk-801 are noncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonists that produce acute psychosis in humans. the psychosis produced by these psychomimetic drugs is indistinguishable from schizophrenia and includes both positive and negative symptoms. this drug-induced psychosis occurs after puberty in humans. on the basis of the mk-801-induced spike-and-wave activity in rats and increased blood flow and metabolism in brain of patients with psychosis caused by these psychomimetics, this brief review argues that this psychosis is an atypical form of limbic epilepsy. moreover, there is a specific limbic thalamcortical psychosis circuit that mediates cell injury in limbic cortex of rodents and may mediate this pcp-induced psychosis in humans. it is proposed that this thalamocortical psychosis circuit develops at puberty and can mediate pcp and ketamine-mediated psychosis and possibly the psychosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disease and other disorders that have their onset at puberty. finally, based on this developmentally regulated psychosis/epilepsy-related thalamocortical circuitry, it is proposed that antiepileptic drugs that promote gabaergic mechanisms may decrease the probability of episodic psychosis from any cause.
abstract we explored the effects of different doses of letrozole on the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) after oocyte retrieval during in vitro fertilization (ivf) in patients with high-risk ohss. a total of 88 patients were randomly divided into a control group, and groups treated with 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 7.5 mg of letrozole. we found that from the fifth day after human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) treatment, the e2 level decreased and there were statistical differences between the four groups (p < 0.05). from the eighth day after hcg treatment, the luteinizing hormone (lh) level increased, but the progesterone (p) level decreased. there were statistical differences between groups (p < 0.05). from the fifth day after hcg treatment, the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) increased in the control, but decreased in the letrozole groups in a dose-dependent manner. there were statistically significant differences between groups (p < 0.001). the incidence of moderate and severe ohss was lower in the 7.5 mg group than in the control group (p < 0.05). in the patients with high-risk ohss undergoing whole embryo frozen transfer, treatment with 7.5 mg letrozole may be useful to limit ohss. objective to investigate the effect of letrozole-an oral aromatase inhibitor-on e(2), p, and lh levels when administered during the luteal phase after oocyte retrieval in ivf/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi) cycles.   design prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial.   setting university-affiliated private reproductive medicine center.   patient(s) thirty oocyte donors undergoing standardized controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (coh) protocols.   intervention(s) patients were randomized after successful egg retrieval to receive either 2.5 mg of letrozole (femara; novartis, barcelona, spain) or a placebo (folic acid tablets). all donors were under intrauterine device (iud) contraception.   main outcome measure(s) serum e(2), p, and lh the day of hcg administration and days +4, +7 and +10 after ovum pick-up.   result(s) donors had a comparable serum e(2) level on the day of hcg administration (1,858 vs. 2,143 pg/ml). interestingly, levels dramatically dropped 4 days after egg retrieval, reaching a statistically significant lower level in those receiving letrozole (279 vs. 1,586 pg/ml). again, at the next time points serum e(2) levels were significantly lower (day +7: 240 vs. 855 pg/ml and day +10: 40 vs. 448 pg/ml). no significant differences were observed in p levels, but lh serum concentrations were lower in the control group on day +7 (0.18 vs. 0.02 miu/ml and day +10 (0.40 vs. 0.16 miu/ml), when serum e(2) levels were higher.   conclusion(s) the administration of 2.5 mg of letrozole during the luteal phase has an impact on corpus luteum (cl) function. it reduces serum e(2) levels, which allows a faster recovery of lh concentration. this may be of interest not only for egg donors, but also in patients at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) who freeze all their embryos or who cancel hcg administration to reduce the potential risk that high e(2) levels pose.
endothelin-1 (et-1) activates two types of ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels (designated nscc-1 and nscc-2) and a store-operated ca2+ channel (socc) in chinese hamster ovary cells expressing endothelina receptors (cho-etar). these channels can be distinguished by their sensitivity to ca2+ channel blockers 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1h-imidazole hydrochloride (sk&f 96365) and (r,s)-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-isochinolin-1-yl)-2-phenyl-n,n-di[2-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]acetamid mesylate (loe 908). nscc-1 is sensitive to loe 908 and resistant to sk&f 96365; nscc-2 is sensitive to both blockers, and socc is resistant to loe 908 and sensitive to sk&f 96365. in this study, we examined the mechanism of et-1-induced arachidonic acid (aa) release. both sk&f 96365 and loe 908 inhibited et-1-induced aa release with the ic50 values correlated to those of et-1-induced ca2+ influx. moreover, combined treatment with these blockers abolished et-1-induced aa release. wortmannin and ly294002, inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k), partially inhibited et-1-induced aa release. loe 908, but not sk&f 96365, inhibited et-1-induced aa release in wortmannin-treated cho-etar. et-1 also induced aa release in cho cells expressing etar truncated at the carboxyl terminal downstream of cys385 (cho-etardelta385) or an unpalmitoylated (cys383 cys385-388--> ser383ser385-388) etar (cho-seretar), each of which is coupled with gq or gs/g12, respectively. in cho-seretar, a dominant-negative mutant of g12 inhibited aa release. sk&f 96365 inhibited et-1-induced aa release in cho-etardelta385, whereas loe 908 inhibited it in cho-seretar. these results indicate the following: 1) et-1-induced aa release depends on ca2+ influx through nscc-1, nscc-2, and socc in cho-etar; 2) gq and g12 mediate aa release through etar in cho cells; and 3) pi3k is involved in et-1-induced aa release, which depends on nscc-2 and socc. the present study investigates whether endothelin-1 (et-1), like noradrenaline (na), stimulates the release of arachidonic acid (aa) via cytosolic phospholipase a2 (cpla2) in rat tail artery. in tail artery segments labelled with [3h]aa, et-1-induced aa release in a concentration-dependent manner with an ec50 of 1.3 nm. the effect of et-1 was inhibited by bosentan and was insensitive to bq788, suggesting the involvement of eta receptor. the stimulation of aa release induced by et-1 was prevented by arachydonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (aacocf3), a selective inhibitor of cpla2 and not by rhc80267, a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor. furthermore, pd98059, inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) cascade and calphostin c, a protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor, prevented the stimulation of aa release induced by et-1 and na. immunoblotting of the cytosolic fraction of rat tail arteries stimulated with et-1 or na showed an increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erks) phosphorylation and this effect was abolished by calphostin c treatment. these findings show that in rat tail artery et-1 and na induce a sequential activation of protein kinase c and extracellular signal-regulated kinases that results in stimulation of aa release via cpla2 activation. this may represent a general pathway by which g-proteins coupled receptors stimulate aa release and its metabolites in vascular smooth muscle.
we investigated the association of oral contraceptive (oc) use and reproductive factors with colorectal cancer risk in a large population-based case-control study. cases were women ages 20 to 74 years, living in wisconsin, with a new diagnosis of colon (n = 1,122) or rectal (n = 366) cancer. control participants were randomly selected from population lists of similarly aged female wisconsin residents (n = 4,297). risk factor information was collected through structured telephone interviews. compared with never users, oc users had an odds ratio (or) of 0.89 [95% confidence interval (95% ci), 0.75-1.06] for colorectal cancer. oc use associations did not differ significantly between colon and rectal cancer sites; however, when compared with never users, recent oc users (<14 years) seemed at reduced risk of rectal cancer (or, 0.53; 95% ci, 0.28-1.00). women with age at first birth older than the median (23 years) had 0.83 times the risk of colon cancer compared with women with age at first birth below the median (95% ci, 0.70-0.98). we observed an inverse trend between increasing parity and rectal cancer risk (p = 0.05). compared with nulliparous women, women with five or more births had 0.66 times the risk of rectal cancer (95% ci, 0.43-1.02). compared with postmenopausal women, premenopausal women were at reduced risk (or, 0.67; 95% ci, 0.47-0.97) of colorectal cancer. no significant associations were observed between colorectal cancer risk and age at menarche or age at menopause. these findings suggest differential roles of reproductive factors in colon and rectal cancer etiology. in los angeles county, the age-adjusted incidence rate of colon cancer in men is almost 30% higher than that in women; however, in the descending and sigmoid colon, age-specific incidence rates for women are higher than those for men before age 55. since menstrual and/or reproductive factors may be involved in producing this crossover in age-specific rates, they were examined in a population-based case-control study involving 327 white women with adenocarcinoma of the colon and age-, race- and neighbourhood-matched controls. after adjustment for other factors associated with colon cancer in this study (family history of large bowel cancer, total fat intake, calcium, weight and activity level), ever having been pregnant was protective (rr = 0.56, 95% ci = 0.33-0.97). for one to two pregnancies, the rr was 0.76 (ci = 0.42-1.37); for three or more pregnancies, the rr was 0.45 (ci = 0.25-0.81). however, the relationship between the number of pregnancies and colon cancer risk was actually u-shaped, with risk decreasing with successive pregnancies up to four and then increasing with additional pregnancies. the u-shaped relationship was present for incomplete as well as for full-term pregnancies and was more striking for cancers occurring in the distal (descending and sigmoid) than proximal (caecum to splenic flexure) colon. risk was not related to age at menarche or use of exogenous oestrogens, but delayed natural menopause was weakly protective in the proximal but not distal colon. the crossover in incidence rates in the distal colon can be completely accounted for by the pregnancy effect. the u-shape of the pregnancy curve suggests the possibility of competing factors, some protective, especially after one or several pregnancies, and others conferring increasing risk with successive pregnancies, regardless of the pregnancy outcome.
this study examined sexual risk behaviors and sexual refusal assertiveness in relationship to child sexual abuse, emotion dysregulation, and adult sexual revictimization. path analyses of 1,094 survivors who had sex in the past year were done to examine sexual risk behavior and sexual refusal assertiveness mediational pathways by which child sexual abuse severity and emotion dysregulation may affect revictimization over one year in adult female sexual assault survivors. exchanging sex for money and sexual refusal assertiveness were significantly associated with emotion dysregulation, whereas exchanging sex for money, and not sexual refusal assertiveness, was only significantly related to child sexual abuse severity. both exchanging sex for money and sex refusal assertiveness mediated the relationship between emotion dysregulation and adult sexual revictimization. exchanging sex for money mediated the child sexual abuse severity-revictimization relationship. these findings demonstrate the importance of considering both risky and protective sexual behaviors in research and prevention programming that address sexual revictimization in women. objective the current study examined emotion dysregulation as a mechanism underlying risky sexual behavior and sexual revictimization among adult victims of child sexual abuse (csa) and child physical abuse (cpa).   methods participants were 752 college women. victimization history, emotion dysregulation, and risky sexual behavior were assessed with anonymous, self-report surveys utilizing a cross-sectional design.   results approximately 6.3% of participants reported csa, 25.5% reported cpa, and 17.8% reported rape during adolescence or adulthood. csa and cpa were associated with increased risk for adolescent/adult rape; 29.8% of csa victims and 24.3% of cpa victims were revictimized. path analytic models tested hypothesized relationships among child abuse, emotion dysregulation, adolescent/adult rape and three forms of risky sexual behavior (e.g., failure to use condoms, contraception, or having sex with someone under the influence of alcohol/drugs), including frequency of risky sexual behavior with a regular dating partner, with a stranger, and lifetime number of intercourse partners. emotion dysregulation mediated revictimization for both csa and cpa. emotion dysregulation also predicted lifetime number of sexual partners and frequency of risky sex with a stranger, but not frequency of risky sex with a regular dating partner.   conclusions findings suggest that emotion dysregulation is a distal predictor, and risky sex, particularly with lesser known partners, is a proximal predictor of sexual revictimization. because emotion dysregulation also maintained a significant direct path to revictimization, risky sexual behavior appears to be one of several proximal risk factors for revictimization.   practice implications findings confirm that emotion dysregulation is a critical pathway to more proximal risk factors such as risky sexual behavior, and suggest that clinical interventions aimed at improving emotion dysregulation may help reduce risky sexual behavior and risk for revictimization.
in long-term two-bottle tests, mice from the c57bl/6byj (b6) strain drink more monosodium l-glutamate (msg) and inosine-5'-monophosphate (imp) compared with mice from the 129p3/j (129) strain. the goal of this study was to assess the role of afferent gustatory input in these strain differences. we measured integrated responses of the mouse chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves to lingual application of compounds that evoke umami taste in humans: msg, monoammonium l-glutamate (nh(4) glutamate), imp and guanosine-5'-monophosphate (gmp) and also to other taste stimuli. chorda tympani responses to msg and nh(4) glutamate were similar in b6 and 129 mice. chorda tympani responses to imp and gmp were lower in b6 than in 129 mice. responses to umami stimuli in the glossopharyngeal nerve did not differ between the b6 and 129 strains. responses to msg, imp and gmp were not affected by sodium present in these compounds because b6 and 129 mice had similar neural taste responses to nacl. this study has demonstrated that the increased ingestive responses to the umami stimuli in b6 mice are accompanied by either unchanged or decreased neural responses to these stimuli. lack of support for the role of the chorda tympani or glossopharyngeal nerves in the enhanced consumption of msg and imp by b6 mice suggests that it is due to some other factors. although results of our previous study suggest that postingestive effects of msg can affect its intake, contribution of other gustatory components (e.g. greater superficial petrosal nerve or central gustatory processing) to the strain differences in consumption of umami compounds also cannot be excluded. strain differences in gustatory neural responses to nucleotides but not glutamate suggest that these compounds may activate distinct taste transduction mechanisms. inhibitory effects of amiloride on salt responses of the chorda tympani nerve and its temperature dependency were compared among three inbred strains of mice (c57bl, balb and 129). in c57bl mice, lingual treatment with amiloride significantly suppressed responses to 0.1-1.0 m nacl at two different temperatures, 24 +/- 2 degrees c and 12 +/- 2 degrees c. the magnitude of the amiloride-inhibited component of nacl response was slightly larger at the higher temperature. in contrast, in balb mice, amiloride suppression of nacl responses was observed only at the lower temperature. no such suppression was exhibited by 129 mice at either temperature levels. these results suggest that there exist at least two different amiloride-sensitive receptor components for nacl in mice: one is more sensitive to nacl at the higher temperature, and the other is more sensitive at the lower temperature. it is hypothesized, c57bl mice possess the former (or both) component(s), whereas balb mice have the latter one. the 129 strain may be lacking both components.
the present paper argues that the effect of corruption on foreign ownership is not necessarily linear and depends on the level of host corruption. so long as the expected returns from foreign investments exceed its expected costs, higher host corruption will be associated with higher foreign ownership. however, costs may exceed or exactly compensate the returns to foreign investment at very high level of corruption, giving rise to negative or even an insignificant relationship when positive and negative effects outweigh each other. further, we argue that this non-linear corruption effects may arise from multinational firms' attempts to investing in countries with similar environment and/or ensuring some formal networking with host countries in a bid to limit the damages caused by high level of host corruption. panel fixed effects estimates (after correcting for foreign entry selection) using a recent large home-host matched panel data from central and eastern european host countries provide some support to these hypotheses: (i) higher corruption is associated with significantly higher foreign ownership unless corruption is at its fourth quartile value. (ii) there is also some confirmation that this non-linear corruption effects is linked to parent firms' attempts to ensure institutional similarity while investing in corrupt host countries: in particular, foreign multinationals from eu/oecd home countries tend to hold higher ownership in eu/oecd host countries and also when the home-host relative corruption distance is small. this paper studies the joint impact of corruption on the entry mode and volume of inward foreign direct investment (fdi) using a unique firm-level data set. we find that corruption not only reduces inward fdi, but also shifts the ownership structure towards joint ventures. the latter finding supports the view that corruption increases the value of using a local partner to cut through the bureaucratic maze. however, r&d intensive firms are found to favor sole ownership.
backgroundinterleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the jak-stat pathway via activation of stat1 and stat3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively. epithelial–mesenchymal transition (emt) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis. although il-27 has been shown to have potent anti-tumor activity in various cancer models, the role of il-27 in emt and angiogenesis is poorly understood. in this study, we investigated the role of il-27 in regulating emt and angiogenesis through modulation of the stat pathways in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (nsclc) cells.methodsstat activation following il-27 exposure was measured in human nsclc cell lines. expression of epithelial (e-cadherin, γ-catenin) and mesenchymal (n-cadherin, vimentin) markers were assessed by western blot analysis. production of pro-angiogenic factors (vegf, il-8/cxcl8, cxcl5) were examined by elisa. cell motility was examined by an in vitro scratch and transwell migration assays. selective inhibitors of stat1 (stat1 sirnas) and stat3 (stattic) were used to determine whether both stat1 and stat3 are required for il-27 mediated inhibition of emt and secretion of angiogenic factors.resultsour results demonstrate that il-27 stimulation in nsclc resulted in 1) stat1 and stat3 activation in a jak-dependent manner, 2) development of epithelial phenotypes, including a decrease in the expression of a transcriptional repressor for e-cadherin (snail), and mesenchymal marker (vimentin) with a reciprocal increase in the expression of epithelial markers, 3) inhibition of cell migration, and 4) reduced production of pro-angiogenic factors. stat1 inhibition in il-27–treated cells reversed the il-27 effect with resultant increased expression of snail, vimentin and the pro-angiogenic factors. the inhibition of stat3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype.conclusionil-27 induces mesenchymal to epithelial transition and inhibits the production of pro-angiogenic factors in a stat1–dominant pathway. these findings highlight the importance of stat1 in repressing lung carcinogenesis and describe a new anti-tumor mechanism of il-27. interferon-γ (ifnγ) is a pluripotent cytokine whose major biological effects are mediated through a pathway in which stat1 is the predominant and essential transcription factor. stat3 can also be activated weakly by ifnγ, but the mechanism of activation and function of stat3 as a part of the interferon response are not known. here we show that stat3 activation is much stronger and more prolonged in stat1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts than in wild-type cells. in response to ifnγ, src-family kinases are required to activate stat3 (but not stat1) through tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the receptor-bound kinases jak1 and jak2 are required to activate both stats. tyrosine 419 of the ifnγ receptor subunit 1 (ifngr1) is required to activate both stats, suggesting that stat1 and stat3 compete with each other for the same receptor phosphotyrosine motif. activated stat3 can replace stat1 in stat1-null cells to drive the transcription of certain genes, for example, socs-3 and c/ebpδ, which have γ-activated sequence motifs in their promoters. work from ian kerr's laboratory reveals that the gp130-linked interleukin-6 receptor, which usually activates stat3 predominantly, activates stat1 efficiently when stat3 is absent (costa-pereira, a. p., tininini, s., strobl, b., alonzi, t., schlaak, j. f., is'harc, h., gesualdo, i., newman, s. j., kerr, i. m., and poli, v. (2002) proc. natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 99, 8043–8047). because stat1 and stat3 have opposing biological effects (stat3 is an oncogene, and stat1 is a tumor suppressor), the reciprocal activation of these two transcription factors in response to ifnγ or interleukin-6 suggests that their relative abundance, which may vary substantially in different normal cell types, under different conditions or in tumors is likely to have a major impact on how cells behave in response to different cytokines.
abstract an analysis of the structure of diethylstilbestrol (des) indicates that neither des nor any of its metabolites are potential mutagens. moreover, the present analyses suggest (a) that the observed carcinogenic spectrum of des reflects the activity of metabolic intermediates and (b) that the carcinogenicity of des in mice is due to the presence of a 6 å geometric descriptor that appears to be related to an estrogen receptor. an analysis of the chemical structure of tamoxifen, toremifene and their metabolites indicates that metabolism to a dna-reactive hydroxylamine intermediate is possible. the parent compounds and many of their metabolites are predicted to be rodent carcinogens. moreover, many of these metabolites contain a 6 a or 8.4 a distance descriptor biphore. these geometric descriptors may be related to an ability of these chemicals to bind to an estrogen receptor. the prediction of the carcinogenicity of toremifene is not in accord with studies published thus far. however, the reports available have not excluded this possibility, since the protocols used have not addressed it systematically.
background impulsivity is a hallmark of problem gambling. however, impulsivity is not a unitary construct and this study investigated the relationship between problem gambling severity and two facets of impulsivity: impulsive action (impaired ability to withhold a motor response) and impulsive choice (abnormal aversion for the delay of reward). methods the recruitment includes 65 problem gamblers and 35 normal control participants. on the basis of dsm-iv-tr criteria, two groups of gamblers were distinguished: problem gamblers (n = 38) and pathological gamblers (n = 27) with similar durations of gambling practice. impulsive action was assessed using a response inhibition task (the stop-signal task). impulsive choice was estimated with the delay-discounting task. possible confounds (e.g., iq, mood, adhd symptoms) were recorded. results both problem and pathological gamblers discounted reward at a higher rate than their controls, but only pathological gamblers showed abnormally low performance on the most demanding condition of the stop-signal task. none of the potential confounds covaried with these results. conclusions these results suggest that, whereas abnormal impulsive choice characterizes all problem gamblers, pathological gamblers' impairments in impulsive action may represent an important developmental pathway of pathological gambling. research and clinical expertise indicates that impulsivity is an underlying feature of pathological gambling. this study examined the extent to which impulsive behavior, defined by the rate of discounting delayed monetary rewards, varies with pathological gambling severity, assessed by the south oaks gambling screen (sogs). sixty-two pathological gamblers completed a delay discounting task, the sogs, the eysenck impulsivity scale, the addiction severity index (asi), and questions about gambling and substance use at intake to outpatient treatment for pathological gambling. in the delay discounting task, participants chose between a large delayed reward (us $1000) and smaller more immediate rewards (us $1-$999) across a range of delays (6h to 25 years). the rate at which the delayed reward was discounted (k value) was derived for each participant and linear regression was used to identify the variables that predicted k values. age, gender, years of education, substance abuse treatment history, and cigarette smoking history failed to significantly predict k values. scores on the eysenck impulsivity scale and the sogs both accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in k values. the predictive value of the sogs was 1.4 times that of the eysenck scale. these results indicate that of the measures tested, gambling severity was the best single predictor of impulsive behavior in a delay discounting task in this sample of pathological gamblers.
during protein synthesis, mrna and trna are moved through the ribosome by the process of translocation. the small diameter of the mrna entrance tunnel only permits unstructured mrna to pass through. however, there are structured elements within mrna that present a barrier for translocation that must be unwound. the ribosome has been shown to unwind rna in the absence of additional factors, but the mechanism remains unclear. here, we show using single molecule förster resonance energy transfer and small angle x‐ray scattering experiments a new global conformational state of the ribosome. in the presence of the frameshift inducing dnax hairpin, the ribosomal subunits are driven into a hyper‐rotated state and the l1 stalk is predominantly in an open conformation. this previously unobserved conformational state provides structural insight into the helicase activity of the ribosome and may have important implications for understanding the mechanism of reading frame maintenance. during the elongation cycle, trna and mrna undergo coupled translocation through the ribosome catalyzed by elongation factor g (ef-g). cryo-em reconstructions of certain ef-g-containing complexes led to the proposal that the mechanism of translocation involves rotational movement between the two ribosomal subunits. here, using single-molecule fret, we observe that pretranslocation ribosomes undergo spontaneous intersubunit rotational movement in the absence of ef-g, fluctuating between two conformations corresponding to the classical and hybrid states of the translocational cycle. in contrast, posttranslocation ribosomes are fixed predominantly in the classical, nonrotated state. movement of the acceptor stem of deacylated trna into the 50s e site and ef-g binding to the ribosome both contribute to stabilization of the rotated, hybrid state. furthermore, the acylation state of p site trna has a dramatic effect on the frequency of intersubunit rotation. our results provide direct evidence that the intersubunit rotation that underlies ribosomal translocation is thermally driven.
backgroundprocurement and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (llins) in the african region has decreased from 145 million in 2010 to 66 million nets in 2012. as resources for llin distribution appear to stagnate, it is important to understand the users’ perception of the life span of a net and at what point and why they stop using it. in order to get the most value out of distributed nets and to ensure that they are used for as long as possible, programmes must communicate to users about how to assess useful net life and how to extend it.methodsdata were collected from 114 respondents who participated in 56 in-depth interviews (idis) and eight focus group discussions (fgds) in august 2012 in eight regions in senegal. households were eligible for the study if they owned at least one net and had an available household member over the age of 18. data were coded by a team of four coders in atlas.ti using a primarily deductive approach.resultsrespondents reported assessing useful net life using the following criteria: the age of net, the number and size of holes and the presence of mosquitoes in the net at night. if they had the means to do so, many respondents preferred the acquisition of a new net rather than the continued use of a very torn net. however, respondents would preferentially use newer nets, saving older, but useable nets for the future or sharing them with family or friends. participants reported observing alternative uses of nets, primarily for nets that were considered expired.conclusionsthe results indicate that decisions regarding the end of net life vary among community members in senegal, but are primarily related to net integrity. additional research is needed into user-determined end of net life as well as care and repair behaviours, which could extend useful net life. the results from this study and from future research on this topic should be used to understand current behaviours and develop communication programmes to prolong the useful life of nets. backgroundthe timor-leste ministry of health has recently finalized the national malaria control strategy for 2010-2020. a key component of this roadmap is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (llins) in support of achieving the primary goal of reducing both morbidity and mortality from malaria by 30% in the first three years, followed by a further reduction of 20% by end of the programme cycle in 2020 [1]. the strategic plan calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education and communication (iec) programme; however, there is limited prior research into household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted, effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials.methodsnine separate focus group discussions (fgds) were carried out in dili, manatuto, and covalima districts, democratic republic of timor-leste, in july 2010.these focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households with at least one net. comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source analysis software.resultsthe primary determinants of net usage were a widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a limited number of nets within households. both nuisance biting and disease prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while seasonality was not a significant factor. long-term net durability and ease of hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. very frequent washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. finally, extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household.conclusionsemphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on malaria control efforts in timor-leste, as the country's programmes make progress towards universal net coverage.
to understand how mirnas contribute to the molecular phenotype of adipose tissues and related traits, we performed global mirna expression profiling in subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue of 70 human subjects and characterised which mirnas were differentially expressed between these tissues. we found that 12% of the mirnas were significantly differentially expressed between abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue (fdr adjusted p<0.05) in the primary study, of which 59 replicated in a follow-up study of 40 additional subjects. further, 14 mirnas were found to be associated with metabolic syndrome case-control status in abdominal tissue and three of these replicated (primary study: fdr adjusted p<0.05, replication: p<0.05 and directionally consistent effect). genome-wide genotyping was performed in the 70 subjects to enable mirna expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) analysis. candidate mirna eqtls were followed-up in the additional 40 subjects and six significant, independent cis-located mirna eqtls (primary study: p<0.001; replication: p<0.05 and directionally consistent effect) were identified. finally, global mrna expression profiling was performed in both tissues to enable association analysis between mirna and target mrna expression levels. we find 22% mirnas in abdominal and 9% mirnas in gluteal adipose tissue with expression levels significantly associated with the expression of corresponding target mrnas (fdr adjusted p<0.05). taken together, our results indicate a clear difference in the mirna molecular phenotypic profile of abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue, that the expressions of some mirnas are influenced by cis-located genetic variants and that mirnas are associated with expression levels of their predicted mrna targets. micrornas (mirnas) are a novel group of universally present small non-coding rnas that have been implicated in wide ranging physiological processes and thereby are critical in the manifestation of diverse diseases. since their discovery as developmental regulators in c.elegans, they have come a long way and are currently associated with normal and diverse pathophysiological states including parkinson’s syndrome, cardiac hypertrophy, viral infection, diabetes and several types of cancer. of special significance is their involvement in diabetes, an area in which several emerging reports point to the fact that these small rna species could be special and critical in this complex disease and they or their specific inhibitors may be exploited as targets for therapeutic intervention. the stable nature of these mirnas over mrnas is an added advantage of them being projected for the same. this review focuses on and discusses the current diabetic epidemic and the potential role(s) of these mirnas in various physiological processes that lead to the diabetic phenotype with an objective of better understanding the emerging mechanisms of these small molecules in the development and progression of diabetes and its complications.
background filamentous fungi are frequently recovered from respiratory cultures of individuals with cf.   methods a cf cohort database was utilized to determine filamentous fungal prevalence and risk factors.   results the prevalence of filamentous fungal isolation increased from 2.0% in 1997 to 28.7% in 2007. the odds of isolating filamentous fungi during a quarter was greater in cf adults [p<0.001], during chronic oral antibiotic use [p=0.002] and increased with each 10% drop in fev(1) percent predicted [p=0.005], while inhaled corticosteroids surprisingly decreased the likelihood [p=0.012]. the direction of these effects persisted after excluding individuals with abpa. a sub-analysis determined older age [p=0.019] and use of inhaled antibiotics [p=0.011] were independent risk factors for onset of fungal colonization.   conclusions this study suggests that isolation of filamentous fungi in cf at jhh has increased and risk factors include older age, decreased lung function, and chronic oral antibiotics. summary aspergillus fumigatus is often found in the respiratory tract secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), although the role of the fungus for progression of pulmonary disease remains unclear. this study aimed to investigate the frequency of a. fumigatus and other fungi in sputum of adult cf patients using different methods for culture and microscopy. results from the analysis of 369 samples from 94 patients showed that a. fumigatus could be isolated in 45.7% of patients. other moulds were rare, but the yeast candida albicans was another frequent isolate, detected in 75.5% of patients. a comparison of different culture media showed no difference between a selective medium developed to specifically inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa and a standard fungal culture medium for growth of a. fumigatus, although both were more efficient for detection of fungi than other bacterial culture media. fluorescent microscopy with calcofluor white was more sensitive for detection of fungal hyphae in undiluted sputum than standard methylene blue staining. this study shows that a. fumigatus and c. albicans have a high frequency in adult cf patients. microbiological analysis should routinely include methods for specific identification of fungi to monitor for potential complications arising from fungal disease in these patients.
hairy adhesive systems of microscopic setae with triangular flattened tips have evolved convergently in spiders, insects and arboreal lizards. the ventral sides of the feet and tails in chameleons are also covered with setae. however, chameleon setae feature strongly elongated narrow spatulae or fibrous tips. the friction enhancing function of these microstructures has so far only been demonstrated in contact with glass spheres. in the present study, the frictional properties of subdigital setae of chamaeleo calyptratus were measured under normal forces in the physical range on plane substrates having different roughness. we showed that chameleon setae maximize friction on a wide range of substrate roughness. the highest friction was measured on asperities of 1 μm. however, our observations of the climbing ability of ch. calyptratus on rods of different diameters revealed that also claws and grasping feet are additionally responsible for the force generation on various substrates during locomotion. the striking morphological convergence of hair-like integumentary derivatives of lizards and arthropods (spiders and insects) demonstrates the importance of such features for enhancing purchase on the locomotor substrate. these pilose structures are responsible for the unique tractive abilities of these groups of animals, enabling them to move with seeming ease on overhanging and inverted surfaces, and to traverse inclined smooth substrates. three groups of lizards are well known for bearing adhesion-promoting setae on their digits: geckos, anoles and skinks. similar features are also found on the ventral subdigital and distal caudal skin of chameleons. these have only recently been described in any detail, and structurally and functionally are much less well understood than are the setae of geckos and anoles. the seta-like structures of chameleons are not branched (a characteristic of many geckos), nor do they terminate in spatulate tips (which is characteristic of geckos, anoles and skinks). they are densely packed and have attenuated blunt, globose tips or broad, blade-like shafts that are flattened for much of their length. using a force transducer, we tested the hypothesis that these structures enhance friction and demonstrate that the pilose skin has a greater frictional coefficient than does the smooth skin of these animals. our results are consistent with friction being generated as a result of side contact of the integumentary filaments. we discuss the evolutionary and functional implications of these seta-like structures in comparison with those typical of other lizard groups and with the properties of seta-mimicking synthetic structures.
backgroundradioguided occult lesion localization (roll) is a new technique to detect nonpalpable breast tumors. we report our experience using injection of a single radiotracer to localize occult lesions together with sentinel lymph node (sln) biopsy (snoll). the aim of this series was to evaluate the feasibility of the technique, its efficacy, and the rate of reoperation.methodsunder sonographic guidance, a nanocolloidal tracer was injected peritumorally above and below the lesion. a handheld gamma probe detector was used to locate and to guide its surgical removal. an intraoperative (io) macroscopic examination of the specimen with margins evaluation and io imprint cytology of sln was always performed.resultsthe targeted lesion was localized and removed in all cases. final pathological diagnosis identified invasive in 70 patients and ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) in 2 patients. the average size of the resected lesion was 11 mm (4–50 mm). in 61 out of the 72 patients (85%), the breast specimen had clear and large margins. sentinel lymph node (sln) biopsy was performed in 70 patients with an identification rate of 90%. final pathological sln metastasis rate approached 25% (pn1 14%, pn1(mi) 11%). despite intraoperative examination of the specimen, a total of 29% (21 out of 72) patients had to be reoperated (8 patients for involved margins, 10 patients for an involved sln, and 3 for both).conclusionthis technique with a single nanocolloid tracer used both for roll and sln detection is reliable for removing nonpalpable lesions. the use of this technique may have implications for further reducing reoperation rates. background the objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of radio-guided occult lesion localization (roll) in breast-conserving surgery for nonpalpable breast cancer.   methods altogether 215 breast cancer patients were included in a prospective study. ultrasonographically guided intratumoral injection of radioactive tracer was used for tumor localization in 64 patients with nonpalpable tumors, visible in breast ultrasonography (the roll group). nonpalpable tumors, visible only in mammography, were localized with a help of a guidewire in 14 patients (the wgr group). the remaining 137 patients had palpable tumors.   results the proportion of specimens with close or involved margins (0 to 3 mm) was the same in the roll group (6%) and among cases with palpable tumors (5%). in addition the median length of the closest margin did not differ significantly between the groups.   conclusions the results of roll for nonpalpable breast cancer are comparable with those for resection of palpable tumors.
rationale and objectives to evaluate the correlations of tracheal volume and collapsibility on inspiratory and end-expiratory computed tomography (ct) with lung volume and with lung function in smokers.   materials and methods the institutional review board approved this study at each institution. 85 smokers (mean age 68, range 45-87 years; 40 females and 45 males) underwent pulmonary function tests and chest ct at full inspiration and end-expiration. on both scans, intrathoracic tracheal volume and lung volume were measured. collapsibility of the trachea and the lung was expressed as expiratory/inspiratory (e/i) ratios of these volumes. correlations of the tracheal measurements with the lung measurements and with lung function were evaluated by the linear regression analysis.   results tracheal volume showed moderate or strong, positive correlations with lung volume on both inspiratory (r = 0.661, p < .0001) and end-expiratory (r = 0.749, p < .0001) scans. the e/i ratio of tracheal volume showed a strong, positive correlation with the e/i ratio of lung volume (r = 0.711, p < .0001). a weak, negative correlation was found between the e/i ratio of tracheal volume and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity (r = -0.436, p < .0001). also, a weak, positive correlation was observed between the e/i ratio of tracheal volume and the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (r = 0.253, p = .02).   conclusions tracheal volume and collapsibility, measured by inspiratory and end-expiratory ct scans, is related to lung volume and collapsibility. the highly collapsed trachea on end-expiratory ct does not indicate more severe airflow limitation or air-trapping in smokers. purpose to assess forced expiratory tracheal collapsibility in healthy volunteers by using multidetector computed tomography and to compare the results with the current diagnostic criterion for tracheomalacia.   materials and methods an institutional review board approved this hipaa-compliant study. after informed consent was obtained, 51 healthy volunteers (age range, 25-75 years) with normal spirometry results and no history of smoking or risk factors for tracheomalacia were prospectively studied. volunteers were imaged with a 64-detector row scanner, with spirometric monitoring at total lung capacity and during forced exhalation, with 40 mas, 120 kvp, and 0.625-mm detector collimation. cross-sectional area and sagittal and coronal diameters of the trachea were measured 1 cm above the aortic arch and 1 cm above the carina. the percentage of expiratory collapse, the reduction in sagittal and coronal diameters, and the number of participants exceeding the current diagnostic criterion (>50% expiratory reduction in cross-sectional area) for tracheomalacia were calculated.   results the final study population included 25 men and 26 women (mean age, 50 years). the mean percentage of expiratory reduction in tracheal lumen cross-sectional area was 54.34% +/- 18.6 (standard deviation) in the upper trachea and 56.14% +/- 19.3 in the lower trachea. forty (78%) participants exceeded the current diagnostic criterion for tracheomalacia in the upper and/or lower trachea. decreases in cross-sectional area of the upper and lower trachea correlated well with decreases in sagittal (r = 0.807 and 0.688, respectively) and coronal (r = 0.779 and 0.751, respectively) diameters (p < .001 for each correlation).   conclusion healthy volunteers demonstrate a wide range of forced expiratory tracheal collapse, frequently exceeding the current diagnostic criterion for tracheomalacia.
cancer [149 with non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) and 36 with small-cell lung cancer (sclc)] and 97 patients with benign lung diseases in order to determine its clinical usefulness in the diagnosis of lung cancer and follow-up of treatment. we used the cut-off value of 3.5 ng ml'. established by the japan cyfra research group. this cut-off value is based on calculations using the receiver operating characteristic approach instead of using the 95% specificity approach recommended by other authors. the resulting sensitivity and specificity for the group of all lung cancer patients were 65.4% and 84.5% respectively. the sensitivity was highest (76.1%) for squamous cell carcinoma and lowest (44.4%) for sclc. for nsclc patients, when cyfra 21-1 levels were analysed by node (n) factor, patients who presented with mediastinal lymph node metastasis (n2 or n3) demonstrated higher serum cyfra 21-1 levels (5.6; interquartile range 3.2-11.5ng ml-1) than patients without mediastinal node metastasis (no or nl, 3.9; interquartile range 2.2 -10.0 ng ml-; mann-whitney ui-test, p = 0.0373). we compared the discriminatory power of cyfra 21-1 with that of other tumour markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (cea), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (scc) and neuron-specific enolase (nse). the area under the curve (auc) of each roc curve was calculated using the clabroc program for statistical analysis. cyfra 21-1 appeared to have the most discriminatory power of the markers tested in the diagnosis of lung cancer. in serial measurements of 14 patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, a high degree of correlation was noted between serum levels of cyfra 21-1 and extent of clinical response (wilcoxon, p= 0.0093). catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) inactivates catecholamines and catechol drugs such as l-dopa. a common genetic polymorphism in humans is associated with a three-to-four-fold variation in comt enzyme activity and is also associated with individual variation in comt thermal instability. we now show that this is due to g-->a transition at codon 158 of the comt gene that results in a valine to methionine substitution. the two alleles can be identified with a pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using the restriction enzyme nla iii. the identification of a gentic marker associated with significant alterations in enzyme activity will facilitate the analysis of a possible role for the comt gene in neuropsychiatric conditions in which abnormalities in catecholamine neurotransmission are believed to occur, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. in addition, this polymorphism may have pharmacogenetic significance in that it will help make it possible to identify patients who display altered metabolism of catechol drugs.

background antisocial personality disorder (aspd) and borderline personality disorder (bpd) share genetic and environmental risk factors. little is known about the temporal stability of these etiological factors in adulthood.   method dsm-iv criteria for aspd and bpd were assessed using structured interviews in 2282 norwegian twins in early adulthood and again approximately 10 years later. longitudinal biometric models were used to analyze the number of endorsed criteria.   results the mean criterion count for aspd and bpd decreased 40% and 28%, respectively, from early to middle adulthood. rank-order stability was 0.58 for aspd and 0.45 for bpd. the best-fitting longitudinal twin model included only genetic and individual-specific environmental factors. genetic effects, both those shared by aspd and bpd, and those specific to each disorder remained completely stable. the unique environmental effects, however, changed substantially, with a correlation across time of 0.19 for the shared effects, and 0.39 and 0.15, respectively, for those specific to aspd and bpd. genetic effects accounted for 71% and 72% of the stability over time for aspd and bpd, respectively. the genetic and environmental correlations between aspd and bpd were 0.73, and 0.43, respectively, at both time points.   conclusion aspd and bpd traits were moderately stable from early to middle adulthood, mostly due to genetic risk factors which did not change over the 10-year assessment period. environmental risk factors were mostly transient, and appear to be the main source of phenotypic change. genetic liability factors were, to a large extent, shared by aspd and bpd. a sample of 833 twins from the minnesota twin study of adult development and aging completed the multidimensional personality questionnaire (mpq; tellegen, 1982) twice, averaging 59.4 (sd=9.7) years of age at first and 64.4 (sd=10.2) years of age at second testing (average retest interval 5.0 years, sd=2.36, range 1.0-10.4 years). both means and standard deviations of scale scores were extremely stable from first to second testing. in addition, sample participants tended to retain their rank order on the scales (average r=.76 across scales). bivariate biometric analyses showed that the genetic influences on most of the scale scores were almost perfectly correlated across the two waves (range .95 to 1.00). the nonshared environmental influences were also highly correlated across the two waves (range .53 to .73). models specifying identical variance components at the two time points and fixing the genetic correlation to 1.00 provided improved fit. the results suggest that the high stability of personality in later adulthood has a strong genetic foundation, supplemented by stability of environmental effects.
abstract a new approach to adaptive design of clinical trials is proposed in a general multiparameter exponential family setting, based on generalized likelihood ratio statistics and optimal sequential testing theory. these designs are easy to implement, maintain the prescribed type i error probability, and are asymptotically efficient. practical issues involved in clinical trials allowing mid-course adaptation and the large literature on this subject are discussed, and comparisons between the proposed and existing designs are presented in extensive simulation studies of their finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions. adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
benign anastomotic strictures can occur in up to 22% of patients who undergo colonic or rectal resection. traditionally, surgery was the preferred method of treatment, but, over time, endoscopic techniques, such as balloon dilation, have become the preferred modality. however, a high stricture recurrence rate of up to 18-20% and the increased risk of perforation due to uncontrolled stretching are its major drawbacks. endoscopic electrocautery incision (eeci) allows for controlled mucosal incision in predetermined locations of stricture. in this meta-analysis, we have summarized case reports, case series, retrospective studies and prospective studies describing the different endoscopic eeci techniques used for benign lower gastrointestinal tract anastomotic strictures. our analysis showed that eeci, either alone or in combination with other modalities (e.g. balloon dilation, steroid injection or argon plasma coagulation) is an effective treatment option for both treatment-naïve and refractory short non-inflammatory strictures. the overall success rate for eeci-based therapy for benign colorectal stricture was 98.4%, with a stricture recurrence rate of 6.0%. no major adverse event (bleeding, infection or perforation) was reported. only minor adverse events (abdominal pain) were reported in 3.8% of the population. background and study aims endoscopic dilatation is the standard therapy for postoperative colorectal anastomotic strictures, although it carries the risk of perforation at the weakest part of the anastomosis. in order to minimize this risk we have developed a combined technique of endoscopic electroincision and hydraulic balloon dilatation.   patients and methods thirty-six symptomatic patients with benign colorectal anastomotic strictures were referred for endoscopic electroincision with consecutive balloon dilatation, if the diameter of the anastomosis was less than 12 mm (n = 15) or if the diameter was less than 20 mm and the patient complained of repeated obstructive symptoms under conservative therapy (n = 21). under direct endoscopic control the scar tissue at the anastomotic line was incised radially with the tip of the polypectomy snare or with a papillotome. endoscopic hydraulic balloon dilatation was then performed, using a pressure of 35 psi for three minutes. an endoscopic or radiological control was carried out on the second day, and balloon dilatation was repeated if necessary.   results the combined technique of electroincision and consecutive balloon dilatation was performed successfully in 35 patients. in only one patient this therapy could not be performed, because of a long stenotic segment, and surgery was necessary. in 24 patients one single dilatation was sufficient after electroincision, whereas six patients required two, and five patients required three consecutive balloon dilatations. there were no severe complications such as bleeding or perforation. complete follow-up evaluation was possible in 25 patients. in five cases recurrences appeared within the first year; all could be treated successfully by further balloon dilatation.   conclusions the combination of endoscopic electroincision and hydraulic balloon dilatation leads to a high long-term clinical success with a minimum of complications. therefore, in our opinion it is a useful method in the treatment of benign colorectal anastomotic strictures.
backgroundthis study aims to explore the prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness focused on retinal disease in a population above 60 years in nepal.methodstwo thousand one hundred subjects were enrolled in a population-based cross-sectional study. history, presenting and best corrected visual acuity after subjective refraction, anterior and posterior segment examinations was obtained in detail.resultsamong the total subjects, 1860 (88.57%) had complete information. age varies from 60 to 95 (mean age: 69.64 ± 7.31) years. low vision and blindness in both eyes at presentation was found in 984 (52.90%, 95% confidence interval (ci): 50.60–55.19) and 36 (1.94%, 95% ci: 1.35–2.66) subjects respectively. after best correction, bilateral low vision and blindness was found in 426 (22.92%, 95% ci: 21.01–24.88), and 30 (1.61%, 95% ci: 0.10–2.30) subjects respectively. as compared to 60–69 years old, risk of visual impairment was four times higher (95% ci:3.26–5.58) in the 70–79 year olds and 14 times higher (95% ci: 9.72–19.73) in the age group 80 years and above.major causes of bilateral low vision were cataract (68.07%), followed by retinal disorders (28.64%), and for blindness; retinal disorders (46.66%), followed by cataract (43.33%). illiteracy was significantly associated with visual impairment.conclusionamong the elderly population, prevalence of visual impairment was high. refractive error, cataract and retinal disorders were the major cause of low vision. screening the population at the age 60 years and above, focused on cataract and posterior segment diseases, providing glasses and timely referral can help reduce visual impairment. background a national eye care programme was launched in nepal in the early 1980s. the impact of this programme on blindness and cataract surgery prevalence was evaluated in two geographic zones. methods people aged 45 years and older were sampled using a stratified cluster design. within randomly selected clusters, door to door enumeration was followed by visual acuity measurement and eye examinations at conveniently located sites. the full survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance measures carried out. results of the 5112 enumerated individuals 90% were examined. blindness, defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 in both eyes, was found in 5.3% (95% ci 3.6, 6.8) of individuals examined, with cataract being the principal cause in at least one eye in 78% of cases. considering both cataract operated and unoperated cataract blind cases, surgical coverage was approximately 42%. conclusion the findings suggest that blindness prevalence may have decreased slightly from that estimated in a 1981 national survey, both overall and cataract related. similarly, cataract surgical coverage may have increased somewhat. none of these changes, however, are at statistically significant levels. accordingly, the blindness problem remains challengingly high.
hydrotherapy is often used in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome (fms), however there has been limited evaluation of its effectiveness. the aim of this systematic review was therefore to examine the effectiveness of hydrotherapy in the management of fms. amed, bni, cinahl, the cochrane library, embase, medline, proquest, pubmed, science direct and web of science were searched (1990–july 2006). key words used ‘fibromyalgia’ and ‘hydrotherapy’, ‘balneotherapy’, ‘aqua therapy’, ‘pool therapy’, ‘water therapy’, ‘swimming’, ‘hydrogalvanic’, ‘spa therapy’, ‘physiotherapy’, ‘physical therapy’ and ‘rehabilitation’. searches were supplemented with hand searches of selected journals. randomised controlled trials (rcts) were assessed for methodological quality using the van tulder scale. ten rcts met the inclusion criteria. mean methodological quality was 4.5/9 on the van tulder scale. positive outcomes were reported for pain, health-status and tender point count. there is strong evidence for the use of hydrotherapy in the management of fms. objective to evaluate the effects of 6 months of pool exercise combined with a 6 session education program for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (fm).   methods the study population comprised 58 patients, randomized to a treatment or a control group. patients were instructed to match the pool exercises to their threshold of pain and fatigue. the education focused on strategies for coping with symptoms and encouragement of physical activity. the primary outcome measurements were the total score of the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (fiq) and the 6 min walk test, recorded at study start and after 6 mo. several other tests and instruments assessing functional limitations, severity of symptoms, disabilities, and quality of life were also applied.   results significant differences between the treatment group and the control group were found for the fiq total score (p = 0.017) and the 6 min walk test (p < 0.0001). significant differences were also found for physical function, grip strength, pain severity, social functioning, psychological distress, and quality of life.   conclusion the results suggest that a 6 month program of exercises in a temperate pool combined with education will improve the consequences of fm.
context hepatic metastases represent the most relevant prognostic factor in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and are associated with significantly reduced survival. objective the aim of this single-institution retrospective series was to evaluate overall survival and progression-free survival from the diagnosis of liver metastases. patients among 230 consecutive patients diagnosed with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, between 1995 and 2013, 93 had hepatic metastases: in 48 the primary tumor was pancreatic, in 45 gastrointestinal. results median overall survival was 96 months (95% ci, 48-168), 67% of the patients were progressionfree at 5 years. eleven patients underwent radical surgery, 49 had non-radical resection and medical therapy, 9 had partial resection with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, 7 had medical treatment with radionuclide therapy; the remaining 17 patients received medical treatment only. overall, 13 patients (14%) achieved complete remission, 22 (25%) partial remission, 25 (27%) disease stabilization, and 33 (35%) disease progression. the best overall survival (100% at 10 years) was observed in patients with radical resection. age at diagnosis (p<0.005), low histological grade (p<0.0001), type of treatment (p<0.001), isolated liver involvement (p<0.001) and early chromogranin a decrease after treatment (p<0.0001) were positively associated with os. at multivariate analysis, type of treatment (p=0.0029), low histological grade (p<0.0001) and early post-treatment chromogranin a decrease (p=0.0078), retained statistical significance, resulting independent predictors of overall survival. no specific factors were associated with progression-free surviva. conclusions our data has clearly defined the prognostic factors in a cohort of 93 patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with liver metastasis. according to the international guidelines, a multidisciplinary approach is currently advised for the optimal care of patients with a gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (gep net). in our institution (tertiary care center), a systematic multidisciplinary approach was established in may 2007. in this study, we have aimed to assess the initial impact of establishing a systematic multidisciplinary approach to the management of gep net patients. we have collected and compared the biochemical, imaging, and pathological data and the therapeutic strategies in gep net patients diagnosed, treated, or followed-up from january 1993 to april 2007 versus gep net patients attending our institution after the multidisciplinary approach starting, from may 2007 to october 2008. data of 91 patients before and 42 patients after the establishment of the multidisciplinary approach (total: 133 consecutive gep net patients) have been finally collected and analyzed. before the establishment of the multidisciplinary approach, a lack of consistency in the biochemical, imaging, and pathological findings before treatment initiation as well as during follow-up of gep net patients was identified. these inconsistencies have been reduced by the systematic multidisciplinary approach. in addition, the therapeutic management of gep net patients has been altered by the multidisciplinary approach and became more consistent with recommended guidelines. we think that a systematic multidisciplinary approach significantly impacts on gep net patient care and should be established in all centers dealing with these tumors.
the purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of fatigue on the response of the trunk to various combinations of initial static loads and step inputed loads causing rapid sagittal trunk flexion. when attempting to overcome the moments associated with sudden loading, the spine maintains stabilty by increasing joint compression forces (cholewicki & mcgill, 1996) and increasing the level of muscle coactivation, even if it may result in an increased rate of fatigue (zetterberg et al., 1987). in a study that determined the response of the spine to sudden loads causing sagittal flexion, it was found that abdominal muscles rapidly responded to the sudden load with a large increase in muscle activation (krajcarski et al., 1999). also, krajcarski et al. concluded that increases in emg amplitudes of abdominal and trunk extensor muscles were determined predominantly by the added load magnitude and not the pre-loads. chiang (in press) conducted a similar study with the difference being the trunk motion investigated was lateral bend instead of trunk flexion. similar to krajcarski et al. (1999), chiang (in press) concluded that increased muscular activity due to pre-loads leads to increases in trunk muscle stiffness and spine stability. krajcarski et al (1999) and chiang (in press) have provided a greater understanding of the active muscular response that is responsible for maintaining stability. these two studies have demonstrated that a greater preload will result in an increase in trunk stiffness, which is beneficial to the stability of the spine when exposed to sudden loads. unfortunately, the increased trunk stiffness also contributes to trunk muscle fatigue because an increase in muscular activity is what causes the increased stiffness of the trunk. since, muscle fatigue has an effect on the ability of the spine to maintain stability, it would be of significant interest to determine whether a fatigued trunk system responds differently to the preand added loads that were described by krajcarski et al (1999). objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
backgroundscar burden by late gadolinium enhancement (lge) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) is associated with functional recovery after coronary artery bypass surgery (cabg). there is limited data on long-term mortality after cabg based on left ventricular (lv) scar burden.methodspatients who underwent lge cmr between january 2003 and february 2010 within 1 month prior to cabg were included. a standard 16 segment model was used for scar quantification. a score of 1 for no scar, 2 for ≤ 50 % and 3 for > 50 % transmurality was assigned for each segment. lv scar score (lvss) defined as the sum of segment scores divided by 16. all-cause mortality was ascertained by social security death index.resultsone hundred ninety-six patients met the inclusion criteria. 185 cmr studies were available. history of prior mi was present in 64 % and prior cabg in 5.4 % of patients. scar was present in 72 % of patients and median lvef was 38 %. over a median follow up of 8.3 years, there were 64 deaths (34.6 %). there was no statistically significant difference in mortality between scar and no-scar groups (37 % versus 29 %). in the group with scar, a lower scar burden (defined either < 4 segments with scar or based on lvss) was independently associated with increased survival.conclusionin patients undergoing surgical revascularization, scar burden is negatively associated with survival in patients with scar. however, there is no difference in survival based on presence or absence of scar alone. cmr prior to cabg adds additional prognostic information. objectives we hypothesized that myocardial scar characterization using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cmr) may be associated with the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (vt), appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd) therapy and mortality.   background since a minority of patients with prophylactic icd implantation receive appropriate icd therapy, there is a need for more effective risk stratification for primary prevention in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.   methods and results in 99 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, cmr was performed prior to icd implantation. we assessed if cmr indices (cardiac mass, lvef) and cmr scar characteristics (infarct core mass, peri-infarction mass and the ratio's between left ventricular mass, infarct core mass and peri-infarction mass) were associated with outcome. the primary endpoint was sustained vt and/or appropriate icd therapy. the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. during a median follow-up of 5.4 years (iqr 4.5-6.6 years), 34 patients reached the primary end-point (17 appropriate icd shocks) and 26 patients died. in multivariable cox regression analysis, peri-infarction to core-infarction ratio (hr 2.01, 95%ci: 1.17-3.44, p=0.01) was independently and significantly associated with the primary endpoint, whereas nyha-class and lower lvef were not. conversely, age (hr 1.06, 95% ci: 1.01-1.12, p=0.02) and lower lvef (hr 0.95, 95% ci: 0.91-1.00, p=0.04) were independently associated with all-cause mortality, mainly due to heart failure.   conclusion a relatively large peri-infarction mass is associated with sustained vt and/or appropriate icd therapy, whereas age and lower lvef are associated with mortality. cmr based tissue characterization could aid in the prediction of specific outcome measures and in clinical decision making.
inaccuracy in mr image–based attenuation correction (mr-ac) leads to errors in quantification and the misinterpretation of lesions in brain pet/mri studies. to resolve this problem, we proposed an improved ultrashort echo time mr-ac method that was based on a multiphase level-set algorithm with main magnetic field (b0) inhomogeneity correction. we also assessed the feasibility of this level-set–based mr-ac method (mr-aclevel), compared with ct-ac and mr-ac provided by the manufacturer of the pet/mri scanner (mr-acmmr). methods: ten healthy volunteers and 20 parkinson disease patients underwent 18f-fdg and 18f-fluorinated-n-3-fluoropropyl-2-β-carboxymethoxy-3-β-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane (18f-fp-cit) pet scans, respectively, using both pet/mri and pet/ct scanners. the level-set–based segmentation algorithm automatically delimited air, bone, and soft tissue from the ultrashort echo time mr images. for the comparison, mr-ac maps were coregistered to reference ct. pet sinogram data obtained from pet/ct studies were then reconstructed using the ct-ac, mr-acmmr, and mr-aclevel maps. the accuracies of suv, suvr (suv and its ratio to the cerebellum), and specific–to–nonspecific binding ratios obtained using mr-aclevel and mr-acmmr were compared with ct-ac using region-of-interest– and voxel-based analyses. results: there was remarkable improvement in the segmentation of air cavities and bones and the quantitative accuracy of pet measurement using the level set. although the striatal and cerebellar activities in 18f-fp-cit pet and frontal activity in 18f-fdg pet were significantly underestimated by the mr-acmmr, the mr-aclevel provided pet images almost equivalent to the ct-ac images. pet quantification error was reduced by a factor of 3 using mr-aclevel (suv error < 10% in mr-aclevel and < 30% in mr-acmmr [version vb18p], and < 5% in mr-aclevel and < 15% in mr-acmmr [vb20p]). conclusion: the results of this study indicate that our new multiphase level-set–based mr-ac method improves the quantitative accuracy of brain pet in pet/mri studies. we present an approach for head mr-based attenuation correction (ac) based on the statistical parametric mapping 8 (spm8) software, which combines segmentation- and atlas-based features to provide a robust technique to generate attenuation maps (μ maps) from mr data in integrated pet/mr scanners. methods: coregistered anatomic mr and ct images of 15 glioblastoma subjects were used to generate the templates. the mr images from these subjects were first segmented into 6 tissue classes (gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, bone, soft tissue, and air), which were then nonrigidly coregistered using a diffeomorphic approach. a similar procedure was used to coregister the anatomic mr data for a new subject to the template. finally, the ct-like images obtained by applying the inverse transformations were converted to linear attenuation coefficients to be used for ac of pet data. the method was validated on 16 new subjects with brain tumors (n = 12) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 4) who underwent ct and pet/mr scans. the μ maps and corresponding reconstructed pet images were compared with those obtained using the gold standard ct-based approach and the dixon-based method available on the biograph mmr scanner. relative change (rc) images were generated in each case, and voxel- and region-of-interest–based analyses were performed. results: the leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of the data from the 15 atlas-generation subjects showed small errors in brain linear attenuation coefficients (rc, 1.38% ± 4.52%) compared with the gold standard. similar results (rc, 1.86% ± 4.06%) were obtained from the analysis of the atlas-validation datasets. the voxel- and region-of-interest–based analysis of the corresponding reconstructed pet images revealed quantification errors of 3.87% ± 5.0% and 2.74% ± 2.28%, respectively. the dixon-based method performed substantially worse (the mean rc values were 13.0% ± 10.25% and 9.38% ± 4.97%, respectively). areas closer to the skull showed the largest improvement. conclusion: we have presented an spm8-based approach for deriving the head μ map from mr data to be used for pet ac in integrated pet/mr scanners. its implementation is straightforward and requires only the morphologic data acquired with a single mr sequence. the method is accurate and robust, combining the strengths of both segmentation- and atlas-based approaches while minimizing their drawbacks.
leading theories of false memory predict that veridical and false recall of lists of semantically associated words can be dissociated by varying the presentation speed during study. specifically, as presentation rate increases from milliseconds to seconds, veridical recall is predicted to increase monotonically while false recall is predicted to show a rapid rise and then a slow decrease—a pattern shown by mcdermott and watson (2001) in a study using immediate recall tests. in three experiments we tested the generality of the effects of rapid presentation rates on veridical and false memory. in experiments 1 and 2 participants exhibited high levels of false recall on a delayed recall test, even for very fast stimulus onset asynchronies (soa)—contrary to predictions from leading theories of false memory. when we switched to an immediate recall test in experiment 3 we replicated the pattern predicted by the theories and observed by mcdermott and watson. follow-up analyses further showed that the relative output position of false recalls is not affected by presentation rate, contrary to predictions from fuzzy trace theory. implications for theories of false memory, including activation monitoring theory and fuzzy trace theory, are discussed. two experiments examined false recall for lists of semantically and phonologically associated words as a function of presentation duration. veridical recall increased with long exposure durations for all lists. for semantically associated lists, false recall increased from 20-250 ms, then decreased. there was a high level of false recall with 20 ms durations for phonologically associated lists (47 and 44% for experiments 1 and 2, respectively), which declined as duration increased. in experiment 2, for lists presented at 20 and 50 ms rates, false recall given zero correct recall was observed frequently, suggesting that conscious recollection of studied words was not necessary for phonological false memory. differences between phonologically and semantically associated lists were consistent with a feature integration model based on automatic initial processing of phonetic features of words.
abstract a large body of work has demonstrated that riparian ecosystems play a critical role regulating interactions between terrestrial and aquatic components of temperate zone landscapes. however, there have been relatively few studies of the role of riparian forests in tropical landscapes. there is a strong need to evaluate the effects of conversion of these forests to pasture and residential land uses on their ability to prevent the movement of nutrients and other pollutants to coastal water bodies. the objectives of this study were (1) to measure a suite of microbial properties that are indicators of the ability of soils to attenuate pollutants and cycle nitrogen (n) in tropical riparian forests under different land use management and (2) to evaluate the effects of conversion of two types of tropical forested wetlands (cativo, prioria copaifera and yolillo, raphia taedigera) on this same suite of soil microbial variables. to accomplish objective #1, we measured these variables in surface soils in intact forest, disturbed forest, pasture and residential land use sites in two locations in the atlantic zone of costa rica. for objective #2 we measured these variables in surface soils of three replicate intact and converted cativo and yolillo forests. results suggest that land use conversion does not decrease levels of microbial biomass and activity in these soils. intact forest sites did not have higher levels of microbial biomass and activity than ‘disturbed sites.’ in several cases, levels of these variables were consistently lower in intact forest than disturbed sites. there were no statistically significant differences between intact and converted cativo and yolillo sites. the relatively low level of activity in the intact sites is likely a ‘succession effect’, where the disturbed sites have younger, more actively growing vegetation that supplies more readily available organic matter to the soil microbial community. high correlations between soil organic matter and microbial biomass and activity strongly support this ‘successional’ explanation of our results. the prevailing paradigm for anticipating changes in soil organic carbon (soc) with changes in land use postulates reductions in soc in managed systems (agriculture and tree plantations) relative to mature tropical forests. variations of this notion are used in carbon models to predict the role of tropical soils in the global carbon cycle. invariably these models show tropical soils as sources of atmospheric carbon. we present data from a variety of studies that show that soc in managed systems can be lower, the same as, or greater than mature tropical forests and that soc can increase rapidly after the abandonment of agricultural fields. history of land use affects the comparison of soc in managed and natural ecosystems. our review of the literature also highlights the need for greater precautions when comparing soc in mature tropical forests with that of managed ecosystems. information on previous land use, bulk density, and consistency in sampling depth are some of the most common omissions in published studies. from comparable soc data from a variety of tropical land uses we estimate that tropical soils can accumulate between 168 and 553 tg c/yr. the greatest potential for carbon sequestration in tropical soils is in the forest fallows which cover some 250 million hectares. increased attention to soc by land managers can result in greater rates of carbon sequestration than predicted by current soc models.
backroundthe high morbidity and mortality in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh) are attributed to severe pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension (ph). ph is characterized by structural changes in pulmonary arteries, resulting in adventitial and medial thickness. these effects are triggered by abnormal apoptosis and proliferation of pulmonary vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (smcs). apelin (apln), a target gene of bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (bmpr2), is known to play an important and manifold role in regulating pulmonary homeostasis promoting endothelial cell (ec) survival, proliferation and migration. in addition to these autocrine effects of apelin, it displays a paracrine function attenuating the response of pulmonary smcs to growth factors and promoting apoptosis. apelin exerts its effect via its g-protein-coupled receptor (aplnr) and is solely expressed by pulmonary vascular ec, whereas aplnr is co-localized in pulmonary ecs and smcs. dysfunction of bmpr2 and downstream signalling have been shown to disturb the crucial balance of proliferation of smcs contributing to the pathogenesis of human and experimentally induced ph. we designed this study to investigate the hypothesis that apelin and aplnr signalling are disrupted in the pulmonary vasculature of rats in nitrofen-induced cdh.methodspregnant rats were exposed to nitrofen or vehicle on d9 of gestation. foetuses were sacrificed on d21 and divided into nitrofen and control group (n = 32). pulmonary rna was extracted and mrna levels of apln and aplnr were determined by quantitative real-time pcr. protein expression of apelin and aplnr was investigated by western blotting. confocal immunofluorescence double staining for apelin, aplnr and smcs were performed.resultsrelative mrna level of apln and aplnr were significantly decreased in the cdh group compared to control lungs. western blotting and confocal microscopy confirmed the qrt-pcr results showing decreased pulmonary protein expression of apelin and aplnr in lungs of nitrofen-exposed foetuses compared to controls.conclusionthis study provides striking evidence of markedly decreased gene and protein expression of apelin and its receptor aplnr in the pulmonary vasculature of nitrofen-induced cdh. the disruption of the apelin–aplnr signalling axis in the pulmonary vasculature may lead to extensive vascular remodelling and contribute to pph in the nitrofen-induced cdh model. background/purpose congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh) remains a major therapeutic challenge despite advances in neonatal resuscitation and intensive care. the high mortality and morbidity in cdh has been attributed to pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension (ph). bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (bmpr2) plays a key role in pulmonary vasculogenesis during the late stages of fetal lung development. bmpr2 is essential for control of endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation. dysfunction of bmpr2 and downstream signaling have been shown to disturb the crucial balance of proliferation of smooth muscle cells contributing to the pathogenesis of human and experimental ph. we designed this study to investigate the hypothesis that bmpr2 signaling is disrupted in nitrofen-induced cdh.   methods pregnant rats were treated with nitrofen or vehicle on gestational day 9 (d9). fetuses were sacrificed on d21 and divided into cdh and control. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and confocal-immunofluorescence were performed to determine pulmonary gene expression levels and protein expression of bmpr2 and related proteins.   results pulmonary bmpr2 gene expression levels were significantly decreased in nitrofen-induced cdh compared to controls. western blotting and confocal microscopy revealed decreased pulmonary bmpr2 protein expression and increased activation of p38(mapk) in cdh compared to controls.   conclusion the observed disruption of the bmpr2 signaling pathway may lead to extensive vascular remodeling and contribute to ph in the nitrofen-induced cdh model. bmpr2 may therefore represent a potential target for the treatment of ph in cdh.
separating singing voice from music accompaniment is very useful in many applications, such as lyrics recognition and alignment, singer identification, and music information retrieval. although speech separation has been extensively studied for decades, singing voice separation has been little investigated. we propose a system to separate singing voice from music accompaniment for monaural recordings. our system consists of three stages. the singing voice detection stage partitions and classifies an input into vocal and nonvocal portions. for vocal portions, the predominant pitch detection stage detects the pitch of the singing voice and then the separation stage uses the detected pitch to group the time-frequency segments of the singing voice. quantitative results show that the system performs the separation task successfully a new method for estimating the fundamental frequencies of concurrent musical sounds is described. the method is based on an iterative approach, where the fundamental frequency of the most prominent sound is estimated, the sound is subtracted from the mixture, and the process is repeated for the residual signal. for the estimation stage, an algorithm is proposed which utilizes the frequency relationships of simultaneous spectral components, without assuming ideal harmonicity. for the subtraction stage, the spectral smoothness principle is proposed as an efficient new mechanism in estimating the spectral envelopes of detected sounds. with these techniques, multiple fundamental frequency estimation can be performed quite accurately in a single time frame, without the use of long-term temporal features. the experimental data comprised recorded samples of 30 musical instruments from four different sources. multiple fundamental frequency estimation was performed for random sound source and pitch combinations. error rates for mixtures ranging from one to six simultaneous sounds were 1.8%, 3.9%, 6.3%, 9.9%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. in musical interval and chord identification tasks, the algorithm outperformed the average of ten trained musicians. the method works robustly in noise, and is able to handle sounds that exhibit inharmonicities. the inharmonicity factor and spectral envelope of each sound is estimated along with the fundamental frequency.
background gene×environment (g×e) interactions are known to predict susceptibility to disorders such as depression and anxiety. adverse experiences in childhood and number of stressful life events (sles) have been widely studied as environmental risk factors; however, sle response has not yet been studied. here we present a first attempt at the analysis of the interaction between the response to personal and academic stressful events during different life stages and the gene polymorphisms 5-httlpr, 5-httvntr (stin2), htr1a c(-1019)g, and bdnf val66met in the prediction of negative affectivity (na).   methods standardized questionnaires (st-dep and stai) were used to measure negative affectivity derived from depression and anxiety in a sample of 303 undergraduate students. response to stressful events during childhood, high school and college years was evaluated together with a self-report personal history form. multiple logistic regression analysis was used to perform association and g×e analysis.   results negative affectivity is strongly associated with childhood maltreatment and stress response. gene associations were observed between 5-httvntr allele 12 and the s_12 haplotype with na derived from high scores in both depression and anxiety. the bdnf gene variant was not associated with na derived from depression or anxiety alone, but it was associated with the comorbid presentation. a significant g×e interaction was observed between the bdnf val66met and stress response during childhood and college years although the risk for negative affectivity conferred by stress response during childhood was only significant among the met allele carriers, while stress response during college years was a significant risk factor regardless of the bdnf val66met genotype. a significant g×e interaction was also found between the htr1a c(-1019)g variant and childhood maltreatment.   limitations the study has two main limitations, sample size is low and retrospective recognition of sles is a concern.   conclusion altogether, our results demonstrate that the bdnf val66met variant moderates the effect of stress during both childhood and college years; although this effect seems to be more critical during childhood given that the risk conferred by childhood stress was restricted to the met allele carriers. we also found that the htr1a c(-1019)g variant moderates the effect of childhood maltreatment in our study population. there has been a dramatic rise in gene x environment studies of human behavior over the past decade that have moved the field beyond simple nature versus nurture debates. these studies offer promise in accounting for more variability in behavioral and biological phenotypes than studies that focus on genetic or experiential factors alone. they also provide clues into mechanisms of modifying genetic risk or resilience in neurodevelopmental disorders. yet, it is rare that these studies consider how these interactions change over the course of development. in this paper, we describe research that focuses on the impact of a polymorphism in a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene, known to be involved in learning and development. specifically we present findings that assess the effects of genotypic and environmental loadings on neuroanatomic and behavioral phenotypes across development. the findings illustrate the use of a genetic mouse model that mimics the human polymorphism, to constrain the interpretation of gene-environment interactions across development in humans.
gonorrhoea continues to be a public health problem in the uk, and is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (sti) after chlamydia. in the uk, gonorrhoea is disproportionately concentrated in epidemiologically distinct subpopulations, with much higher incidence rates in young people, some ethnic minorities and inner city subpopulations. the original model of sti transmission proposed by hethcote and yorke explained some of these features through the concept of the ‘core group’. since then, several authors have modified the original model approach to include multiple sexual activity classes, but found this modelling approach to be inadequate when applied to low-prevalence settings such as the uk. we present a metapopulation framework for modelling gonorrhoea and other stis. the model proposes that the epidemiology of gonorrhoea is largely driven by subpopulations with higher than average concentrations of individuals with high sexual risk activity. we show how this conceptualization of gonococcal epidemiology overcomes key limitations associated with some of the prior efforts to model gonorrhoea. we also use the model to explain several epidemiological features of gonorrhoea, such as its asymmetric distribution across subpopulations, and the contextual risk experienced by members of at-risk subpopulations. finally, we extend the model to explain the distribution of other stis, using chlamydia as an example of a more ubiquitous bacterial sti. spatial distribution of repeat and singly occurring gonorrhea in baltimore, maryland, was examined to identify clusters of core transmitters. gonorrhea reported between 2001 and 2002 was geocoded and mapped. those with more than one gonorrhea infection separated by more than 14 days during the 2-year period were considered repeaters. other cases were treated as isolated events. six definitions of core transmission were examined by census tracts with the highest quintiles of 1) cases for 2001, 2) cases for 2002, 3) rates for 2001, 4) rates for 2002, 5) counts of repeaters over the 2-year period, and 6) proportion of total cases that were repeaters. of the 6,108 gonorrhea cases analyzed, 9% were repeaters. repeaters were more likely to be female and younger. core areas identified by definitions based on overall disease burden agreed well with each other but had poor agreement with definitions based upon repeat infections. repeaters clustered to a greater extent at smaller distances than did singly occurring gonorrhea cases. repeat gonorrhea infections are prevalent in baltimore and likely represent behavior consistent with core transmission. census tracts of core transmission defined by geographic distribution of repeat infections may indicate foci of highest risk sexual behaviors and high transmission.
given an aftermath of a cascade in the network, i.e. a set vi of "infected" nodes after an epidemic outbreak or a propagation of rumors/worms/viruses, how can we infer the sources of the cascade? answering this challenging question is critical for computer forensic, vulnerability analysis, and risk management. despite recent interest towards this problem, most of existing works focus only on single source detection or simple network topologies, e.g. trees or grids. in this paper, we propose a new approach to identify infection sources by searching for a seed set s that minimizes the symmetric difference between the cascade from s and vi, the given set of infected nodes. our major result is an approximation algorithm, called sisi, to identify infection sources without the prior knowledge on the number of source nodes. sisi, to our best knowledge, is the first algorithm with provable guarantee for the problem in general graphs. it returns a 2/((1-ε)2 δ-approximate solution with high probability, where δ denotes the maximum number of nodes in vi that may infect a single node in the network. our experiments on real-world networks show the superiority of our approach and sisi in detecting true source(s), boosting the f1-measure from few percents, for the state-of-the-art netsleuth, to approximately 50%. assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.
backgroundit is becoming progressively more understandable that genetic variability of viruses is a major challenge in translating the laboratory findings to clinic. genetic variability is the underlying cause of variant viral proteins which are not targetable by host immunological machinery.methods500 patients were enrolled in study and amongst them, 451 patients were followed and categorized into two groups on the basis of their treatment response. group 1 consisting of the 376 patients exhibited svr while group 2 comprised 75 patients who were non-responders on the basis of viral load as evidenced by real-time pcr. comparative sequence analysis was done between 75 non-responders and 75 responders (randomly picked from 376) by targeting three genomic regions, 5′utr, core and ns5b and amplified products were directly sequenced and obtained sequences were cleaned, aligned and submitted to genbank. maximum parsimony (mp) method was used for phylogenetic analysis and dendrograms were dragged using mega 5. heterogeneity at nucleotide and amino acid level was determined using software bioedit and dnaman while phosphorylation and n-linked glycosylation sites were determined using netphos 2.0 and signalp-nn.resultsgenotype 3 was prevalent in group 1 whereas non-responders indicated rare genotypes of pakistan i.e. 4 and 5, genotype 6q and 6v were reported first time from pakistan in this study. at nucleotide and amino acid level, the genetic distance and mutation, number of predicted n-phosphorylation and n-glycosylation sites was higher in group 2 as compared to group 1. difference in percentage composition of individual amino acids was noted to be different between the two groups.conclusionsit can be concluded that heterogeneity both at nucleotide and amino acid level contributed in developing drug resistant phenotype. moreover, occurrence of rare genotypes might hurdle the way to positive response of conventional treatment. furthermore, prediction of phosphorylation and glycosylation sites could help in targeting the proper sites for drug designing. we investigated 143 patients with various classes of liver disease and 120 healthy subjects for serological markers of hepatitis c and b viruses. we found a prevalence rate of 37.1% of anti-hcv markers in patients with liver disease (cases), and 4.2% and in the control group. hbsag was detected in 33.6% of cases and 13.3% of the controls. anti-hcv and hbsag were detected in 7.7% of cases but were not detected in the controls. anti-hcv, hbsag, anti-hbe and anti-hdv were detected in three patients. serum protein electrophoresis results showed elevated gammaglobulin and low albumin in patients positive for anti-hcv who had liver disease.
backgroundsince a long time, italy has maintained a dual system to administer childhood immunisations, that is a certain number of mandatory vaccinations and a number of recommended vaccinations. the study aimed to explore the issues surrounding parental acceptance or non-acceptance of the recommended vaccinations for children.methodsparents of children aged 3-5 years of day-care centres in sicily were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire. determinants of the attitude towards recommended vaccinations and social influence on the decision-making process were assessed using logistic regression analysis.resultsof the 1,500 selected parents, 81.0% participated in the study. prior to the survey, the majority of children (97.6%) received recommended vaccines. most parents (74.4%) received information about vaccinations from family paediatricians, showed a good knowledge about the side effects of the vaccines (73.1%), did not worry about their potential dangerousness (53.0%) and would have accepted their children to be vaccinated even if it was not required for day care (84.1%). the majority (79.9%) were not disposed to follow the advises of the anti-vaccination movements. parents' background characteristics, sources of information and social influence were not significantly associated with parental acceptance of recommended vaccines for childhood.conclusionsthis study suggests that health information by family paediatricians is significantly associated with parental acceptance of recommended vaccinations. background the rate of nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements has been increasing, and children with exemptions have contributed to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.   objectives to determine why parents claim nonmedical exemptions and to explore differences in perceptions of vaccines and vaccine information sources between parents of exempt and fully vaccinated children.   design case-control study.   setting colorado, massachusetts, missouri, and washington.   participants surveys were mailed to the parents of 815 exempt children (cases) and 1630 fully vaccinated children (controls randomly selected from the same grade and school) recruited from 112 private and public elementary schools. surveys were completed by 2435 parents (56.1%).   main outcome measures parental reports.   results most children (209 [75.5%] of 277) with nonmedical exemptions received at least some vaccines. the most common vaccine not received was varicella (147 [53.1%] of 277 exempt children). the most common reason stated for requesting exemptions (190 [69%] of 277) was concern that the vaccines might cause harm. parents of exempt children were significantly more likely than parents of vaccinated children to report low perceived vaccine safety and efficacy, a low level of trust in the government, and low perceived susceptibility to and severity of vaccine-preventable diseases. parents of exempt children were significantly less likely to report confidence in medical, public health, and government sources for vaccine information and were more likely to report confidence in alternative medicine professionals than parents of vaccinated children.   conclusion continued efforts must be made to educate parents about the utility and safety of vaccines, especially parents requesting nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements.
article history: received on: 29/11/2012 revised on: 15/12/2012 accepted on: 24/12/2012 available online: 30/12/2012 lct is a synthetic pyrethroid, developed as an insecticide for agricultural and public health applications. the purpose of this study was to investigate the adverse effects of lct on rat liver and to elucidate hepatoprotective ability of cmn against lct. liver injury in male rats was induced by oral administration of lct at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. cmn (200 mg/kg/day by oral administration) was used as a protective agent for the same period as lct. serum and liver samples were collected from all groups at the end of the experimental period. lct-intoxication elicited significant elevations in hepatic markers enzymes (alt and ast) and mda concomitant with significant declines in the antioxidant enzymes (gpx, gst and gr), gsh and tp levels. in addition, it was noted that lct-intoxicated group exhibited a degree of liver dna fragmentation. oral intake of cmn to lct-intoxicated rats exhibited significant decrease in liver enzymes activities and lipid peroxidation, significant increase in antioxidant enzymes activities and partial inhibition in dna fragmentation. therefore, it was concluded that cmn has the ability to scavenge free radicals, protect against oxidative stress and prevent dna fragmentation induced by lct intoxication. the aim of this study was to investigate the toxic effects of pyrethroid pesticide lambda-cyhalothrin in the presence of piperonyl butoxide as a modulator in the liver of juvenile oreochromis niloticus. lc(50) (96h) value of lambda-cyhalothrin was determined as 2.901μg/l for o. niloticus. the fish were exposed to 0.48μg/l (1/6 of the 96-h lc(50)) lambda-cyhalothrin and 10μg/l piperonyl butoxide for 96-h and 15-d. tgsh, gsh, gssg, hsp70 and tbars contents, gpx, gr, gst and caspase-3 enzymes activities were determined. lambda-cyhalothrin caused increases in tgsh, gsh, tbars contents, and gst activity. piperonyl butoxide treatment with lambda-cyhalothrin caused significant increases in tgsh gsh, hsp70, tbars contents, and gpx and gst activities while caspase-3 activity was decreased. the results of the present study revealed that lambda-cyhalothrin caused oxidative stress which upregulated gsh and gsh-related enzymes. piperonyl butoxide increased the oxidative stress potential and apoptotic effects of lambda-cyhalothrin.
summary animal group size distributions are often right‐skewed, whereby most groups are small, but most individuals occur in larger groups that may also disproportionately affect ecology and policy. in this case, examining covariates associated with upper quantiles of the group size distribution could facilitate better understanding and management of large animal groups. we studied wintering elk groups in wyoming, where group sizes span several orders of magnitude, and issues of disease, predation and property damage are affected by larger group sizes. we used quantile regression to evaluate relationships between the group size distribution and variables of land use, habitat, elk density and wolf abundance to identify conditions important to larger elk groups. we recorded 1263 groups ranging from 1 to 1952 elk and found that across all quantiles of group size, group sizes were larger in open habitat and on private land, but the largest effect occurred between irrigated and non‐irrigated land [e.g. the 90th quantile group size increased by 135 elk (95% ci = 42, 227) on irrigation]. only upper quantile group sizes were positively related to broad‐scale measures of elk density and wolf abundance. for wolf abundance, this effect was greater on elk groups found in open habitats and private land than those in closed habitats or public land. if we had limited our analysis to mean or median group sizes, we would not have detected these effects. synthesis and applications. our analysis of elk group size distributions using quantile regression suggests that private land, irrigation, open habitat, elk density and wolf abundance can affect large elk group sizes. thus, to manage larger groups by removal or dispersal of individuals, we recommend incentivizing hunting on private land (particularly if irrigated) during the regular and late hunting seasons, promoting tolerance of wolves on private land (if elk aggregate in these areas to avoid wolves) and creating more winter range and varied habitats. relationships to the variables of interest also differed by quantile, highlighting the importance of using quantile regression to examine response variables more completely to uncover relationships important to conservation and management. many studies have examined grouping as a form of antipredator behaviour, but relatively few studies have examined how group size responds to natural variation in predation risk across space and through time. we studied the responses of elk, cervus elaphus, herd size and composition to natural variation in the risk of predation by wolves, canis lupus, in the gallatin canyon of montana. we found that elk herd size increased as distance to protective cover increased. a positive association between group size and distance to cover is often interpreted as evidence that grouping is an antipredator response. however, we found that herd size increased only on days that wolves were absent. when wolves were present, herd sizes remained small at all distances from cover. this suggests that aggregation far from cover on days that wolves were absent was a foraging response, rather than an antipredator response. these data highlight interaction between temporal and spatial variation in predation risk, and suggest caution in conclusions about the antipredator benefits of grouping in the absence of direct data on risk or predator presence.
long-term air quality data with high temporal and spatial resolutions are needed to understand some important processes affecting the air quality and corresponding environmental and health effects. the annual and diurnal variations of each criteria pollutant including pm2.5 and pm10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm and 10 μm, respectively), co (carbon monoxide), no2 (nitrogen dioxide), so2 (sulfur dioxide) and o3 (ozone) in 31 provincial capital cities between april 2014 and march 2015 were investigated by cluster analysis to evaluate current air pollution situations in china, and the cities were classified as severely, moderately, and slightly polluted cities according to the variations. the concentrations of air pollutants in winter months were significantly higher than those in other months with the exception of o3, and the cities with the highest co and so2 concentrations were located in northern china. the annual variation of pm2.5 concentrations in northern cities was bimodal with comparable peaks in october 2014 and january 2015, while that in southern china was unobvious with slightly high pm2.5 concentrations in winter months. the concentrations of particulate matter and trace gases from primary emissions (so2 and co) and no2 were low in the afternoon (~16:00), while diurnal variation of o3 concentrations was opposite to that of other pollutants with the highest values in the afternoon. the most polluted cities were mainly located in north china plain, while slightly polluted cities mostly focus on southern china and the cities with high altitude such as lasa. this study provides a basis for the formulation of future urban air pollution control measures in china. o3 and pm2.5 were introduced into the newly revised air quality standard system in february 2012, representing a milestone in the history of air pollution control, and china's urban air quality will be evaluated using six factors (so2, no2, o3, co, pm2.5 and pm10) from the beginning of 2013. to achieve the new air quality standard, it is extremely important to have a primary understanding of the current pollution status in various cities. the spatial and temporal variations of the air pollutants were investigated in 26 pilot cities in china from august 2011 to february 2012, just before the new standard was executed. hourly averaged so2, no2 and pm10 were observed in 26 cities, and the pollutants o3, co and pm2.5 were measured in 15 of the 26 cities. the concentrations of so2 and co were much higher in the cities in north china than those in the south. as for o3 and no2, however, there was no significant difference between northern and southern cities. fine particles were found to account for a large proportion of airborne particles, with the ratio of pm2.5 to pm10 ranging from 55% to 77%. the concentrations of pm2.5 (57.5 microg/m3) and pm10 (91.2 microg/m3) were much higher than the values (pm2.5: 11.2 microg/m3; pm10: 35.6 microg/m3) recommended by the world health organization. the attainment of the new urban air quality standard in the investigated cities is decreased by 20% in comparison with the older standard without considering o3, co and pm2.5, suggesting a great challenge in urban air quality improvement, and more efforts will to be taken to control air pollution in china.
introduction with the progression of substance dependence, drug cue-related brain activation is thought to shift from motivational towards habit pathways. however, a direct association between cue-induced brain activation and dependence duration has not yet been shown. we therefore examined the relationship between alcohol cue-reactivity in the brain, cue-induced subjective craving and alcohol dependence duration and severity. since alcohol dependence is highly comorbid with depression/anxiety, which may modulate brain responses to alcohol cues, we also examined the relation between comorbid depression/anxiety and cue-reactivity. methods we compared 30 alcohol dependent patients with 15 healthy controls and 15 depression/anxiety patients during a visual alcohol cue-reactivity task using functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenated level-dependent responses and subjective craving as outcomes. within the alcohol dependent group we correlated cue-reactivity with alcohol dependence severity and duration, with cue-induced craving and with depression/anxiety levels. results alcohol dependent patients showed greater cue-reactivity in motivational brain pathways and stronger subjective craving than depression/anxiety patients and healthy controls. depression/anxiety was not associated with cue-reactivity, but depression severity in alcohol dependent patients was positively associated with craving. within alcohol dependence, longer duration of alcohol dependence was associated with stronger cue-related activation of the posterior putamen, a structure involved in habits, whereas higher alcohol dependence severity was associated with lower cue-reactivity in the anterior putamen, an area implicated in goal-directed behavior preceding habit formation. conclusion cue-reactivity in alcohol dependence is not modulated by comorbid depression or anxiety. more importantly, the current data confirm the hypothesis of a ventral to dorsal striatal shift of learning processes with longer dependence duration, which could underlie increasingly habitual substance use with progressing substance dependence. why are some individuals more susceptible to the formation of inflexible habits than others? in the present study, we used diffusion tensor imaging to demonstrate that brain connectivity predicts individual differences in relative goal-directed and habitual behavioral control in humans. specifically, vulnerability to habitual “slips of action” toward no-longer-rewarding outcomes was predicted by estimated white matter tract strength in the premotor cortex seeded from the posterior putamen (as well as by gray matter density in the posterior putamen as determined with voxel-based morphometry). in contrast, flexible goal-directed action was predicted by estimated tract strength in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seeded from the caudate. these findings suggest that integrity of dissociable corticostriatal pathways underlies individual differences in action control in the healthy population, which may ultimately mediate vulnerability to impulse control disorders.
background digoxin is a frequently prescribed drug, particularly in the elderly population, in which there is an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure. with its complex pharmacokinetic profile and narrow therapeutic index, use of digoxin requires regular monitoring of blood levels. recent evidence suggests that a lower concentration range (0.4–1.0 ng/ml) is preferable in patients with congestive heart failure and a higher range (0.8–2.0 ng/ml) is needed in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmia. the konishi equation is widely used to predict the serum digoxin concentration (sdc) in japan. this study assessed the correlation between sdc predicted by the konishi equation and that actually measured in chinese patients and investigated the impact of renal function on sdc. methods the study subjects comprised 72 patients with cardiac failure or/and atrial tachyarrhythmia seen at our hospital from january 2012 to december 2013. the patients were divided into five groups according to kidney diseases outcome quality initiative guidelines. sdcs were measured using the abbott architect i1000 immunology analyzer. the correlations between measured sdcs and calculated sdcs and between clearance of digoxin and creatinine clearance rate were assessed retrospectively. results the correlation between measured and predicted sdc calculated by the konishi equation was significant (r=0.655, p<0.001) for the 72 patients overall; however, correlations within the different stages of renal function were nonsignificant, with a correlation found only in patients with stage 3 (30 ml per minute < creatinine clearance <60 ml per minute). with regard to the correlation between clearance of digoxin and creatinine clearance, our results show that although there was a significant correlation between clearance of digoxin and creatinine clearance in the group overall, correlations were not evident within the different stages of renal function. conclusion the results of this study indicate that clearance of digoxin and the creatinine clearance rate cannot be explained by renal function alone and that the validity of the konishi equation for individualizing the digoxin dosage in chinese patients is limited, being applicable only in stage 3 renal disease. further research in larger numbers of patients across all stages of renal function will be required in the future to verify the original konishi model. zusammenfassungdie verschiedenen herzglykoside unterscheiden sich erheblich in ihrem retentionsverhalten bei niereninsuffizienz. bei den glykosiden digoxin, digitoxin und strophanthin besteht eine direkte beziehung zwischen dem ausmaß der retention und der normalen renalen clearance dieser substanzen: strophanthin hat die höchste renale clearance und bei niereninsuffizienz die deutlichste verlängerung der pharmakologischen wirkung, während digitoxin eine sehr niedrige clearance hat und auch bei anurischen patienten wegen der erhöhten hepatischen clearance nicht verlangsamt ausgeschieden wird; digoxin nimmt eine mittelstellung ein.die renale ausscheidung eines herzglykosides und seiner metaboliten hängt nicht nur von der clearance, sondern auch von der plasmakonzentration ab, und diese steigt während der ersten tage unter regelmäßiger einnahme bemerkenswert an. von der täglichen dosis werden durch normale nieren unter “steady-state”-bedingungen etwa 90% des strophanthins, 70% des digoxins und 50% des digitoxins (unverändertes herzglykosid und metaboliten) ausgeschieden.die effektivität der hämodialyse hinsichtlich der elimination von herzglykosiden ist gering (3–5%), wenn man sie — wie bisher üblich — mit der menge des einmalig vor beginn der dialyse injizierten herzglykosids vergleicht, sie ist aber relativ hoch (30–50%) im vergleich zur ausscheidungskapazität normaler nieren während einer zeitspanne, die der dialysedauer entspricht. während der hämodialyse sinkt die plasmakonzentration von digoxin so schnell wie bei patienten mit normaler nierenfunktion. dies wird nicht nur durch die effektivität der hämodialyse, sondern auch durch das bei niereninsuffizienz verkleinerte verteilungsvolumen des herzglykosides hervorgerufen.abnahme des verteilungsvolumens und reduzierte myokardempfindlichkeit für herzglykoside bei patienten mit niereninsuffizienz sind die hauptgründe für eine schlechte vorhersagbarkeit der notwendigen individuellen erhaltungsdosis anhand der kreatininclearance. bei patienten mit niereninsuffizienz ist die digitalistoleranz zwar herabgesetzt in hinblick auf die notwendige erhaltungsdosis, aber eher erhöht in hinblick auf die notwendige plasmakonzentration zur aufrechterhaltung der positiv inotropen wirkung. die kombination von hyperkaliämie, hypermagnesiämie, hypokalciämie und acidose, die praktisch nur bei chronischer niereninsuffizienz beobachtet wird, kann die herabgesetzte myokardempfindlichkeit erklären.wenn eine „effektive digitalisierung“ angestrebt wird, können dosierungsformeln, die sich an der kreatininclearance orientieren, nur wenig helfen. wiederholte messungen der “steady-state” plasmakonzentration eines herzglykosides scheinen der einzige weg zur reduzierung des risikos einer unter- bzw. überdigitalisierung bei patienten mit gestörter nierenfunktion zu sein.summarythe various cardiac glycosides differ significantly in their retention as a result of renal failure. in the case of digoxin, digitoxin, and strophanthin the retention is directly related to the normal renal clearance of these cardiac glycosides: strophanthin has the highest clearance and the most marked prolongation of pharmacological action in renal failure, whereas digitoxin shows the lowest renal clearance and even in uremic patients a total elimination comparable to normal subjects as a result of increased hepatic clearance; digoxin takes an intermediate position.the quantity of a cardiac glycoside and its metabolites excreted by the kidneys depends, besides the renal clearance, on the plasma concentration which increases considerably during the first days after onset of treatment. from the daily dose approximately 90% of strophanthin, 70% of digoxin, 50% of digitoxin plus metabolites are excreted by normal kidneys under steady-state conditions.the efficiency of hemodialysis in the elimination of cardiac glycosides is low (3–5%) if estimated in relation to a single dose injected before dialysis and high (30–50%) if estimated in relation to the excretory capacity of normal kidneys during a period corresponding to the duration of a dialysis. during hemodialysis the plasma concentration of digoxin decreases as rapidly as in patients with normal renal function. beside the efficiency of dialysis this finding may be explained by the decrease in the apparent volume of distribution of cardiac glycosides in patients with advanced renal failure; a reduced tissue protein binding seems likely to be the main reason for these changes in chronic renal insufficiency.a reduced volume of distribution and a reduced myocardial sensitivity are the main reasons for a very low predictability of the necessary individual maintenance dose of cardiac glycosides from the creatinine clearance. in patients with advanced renal insufficiency the tolerance to cardiac glycosides is reduced with respect to the daily dose, but it is rather increased in relation to the plasma concentration required to maintain the positive inotropic effect. the combination of hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia and acidosis which is found almost exclusively with chronic renal failure, may explain the reduced myocardial sensitivity. dosage regimens based on the measurement of creatinine-clearance are of little help in “effective digitalisation”. serial measurements of steady-state plasma concentration of cardiac glycosides may be the only way to reduce the risk of under-and overtreatment in patients with impaired renal function.
maternal immune activation (mia) during pregnancy is an environmental risk factor for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. hence, changes in an array of behaviors, including behavioral flexibility, consistent with altered functioning of cortico-limbic circuits have been reported in rodent models of mia. surprisingly, previous studies have not examined the effect of mia on the extinction of fear conditioning which depends on cortico-limbic circuits. thus, we tested the effects of treating pregnant long evans rats with the viral mimetic polyi:c (gestational day 15; 4 mg/kg; i.v.) on fear conditioning and extinction in the male offspring using two different tasks. in the first experiment, we observed no effect of polyi:c treatment on the acquisition or extinction of a classically conditioned fear memory in a non-discriminative auditory cue paradigm. however, polyi:c-treated offspring did increase contextual freezing during the recall of fear extinction in this non-discriminative paradigm. the second experiment utilized a recently developed task to explicitly test the ability of rats to discriminate among cues signifying fear, reward, and safety; a task that requires behavioral flexibility. to our surprise, polyi:c-treated rats acquired the task in a manner similar to saline-treated rats. however, upon subsequent extinction training, they showed significantly faster extinction of the freezing response to the fear cue. in contrast, during the extinction recall test, polyi:c-treated offspring showed enhanced freezing behavior before and after presentation of the fear cue, suggesting an impairment in their ability to regulate fear behavior. these behavioral results are integrated into the literature suggesting impairments in cortico-limbic brain function in the offspring of rats treated with polyi:c during pregnancy. maternal exposure to infection during pregnancy greatly increases the risk of psychopathology in the offspring. in support of clinical findings, rodent models of maternal immune activation (mia) show that prenatal exposure to pathogens can induce phenotypic changes in the offspring associated with schizophrenia, autism, depression and anxiety. in the current study, we investigated the effects of mia via polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly i:c) on emotional behavior and communication in rats. pregnant rats were administered poly i:c or saline on gestation day 15 and male offspring were tested in an auditory fear conditioning paradigm in early adulthood. we found that prenatal poly i:c exposure significantly altered affective signaling, namely, the production of aversive 22-khz ultrasonic vocalizations (usvs), in terms of call number, structure and temporal patterning. mia led to an increase in aversive 22-khz usvs to 300% of saline controls. offspring exposed to mia not only emitted more 22-khz usvs, but also emitted calls that were shorter in duration and occurred in bouts containing more calls. the production of appetitive 50-khz usvs and audible calls was not affected. intriguingly, alterations in aversive 22-khz usv emission were observed despite no obvious changes in overt defensive behavior, which highlights the importance of assessing usvs as an additional measure of fear. aversive 22-khz usvs are a prominent part of the rat's defensive behavioral repertoire and serve important communicative functions, most notably as alarm calls. the observed changes in aversive 22-khz usvs show that mia has long-term effects on emotional behavior and communication in exposed rat offspring.
although accumulating evidence has confirmed that adjuvant tamoxifen (tam) treatment is able to sensitize glioblastoma cells to radiotherapy and inhibit their proliferation, tam is not a suitable treatment for all types of glioblastoma cells; furthermore, long-term tam usage may lead to tam resistance. therefore, understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of tam resistance is necessary in order to improve tam clinical therapy and the quality of life of patients suffering from glioblastomas. in this study, the significance of er-α36 to tam resistance in glioblastoma cells was examined. first, an analysis of er-α36 expression in two glioblastoma cell lines u87-mg and u251, showed that er-α36 was anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane of these cells via caveolin-1. subsequent experiments investigating the mechanism of tam-induced inhibition of u87-mg cell growth showed that tam exerts its effect by inducing apoptosis via a down-regulation of survivin expression and an up-regulation of caspase-3 expression. furthermore, tam also arrested the cell cycle at s-phase. however, when u87-mg cells were preconditioned with an er-α36-specific agonist, ic162, this neutralized tam-induced inhibition of cell growth. this contrasted with the effect of er-α36 depletion by rnai, which enhanced tam-induced inhibition of cell growth. these findings suggest that resistance to tam involves er-α36, which probably acts as a negative regulator of tam-induced inhibition of glioblastoma cell growth. these findings provide a novel insight into the basis of tam resistance during glioblastoma therapy and a further study is underway to reveal more about the specific molecular mechanisms associated with er-α36-mediated tam resistance. cyclin b1 is the regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) and is critical for the initiation of mitosis. accumulating data indicate that the deregulation of cyclin b1 is tightly linked to neoplastic transformation. to study the phenotype and the potential preclinical relevance, we generated hela cell lines stably transfected with the plasmids encompassing short hairpin rna (shrna) targeting cyclin b1. we demonstrate that the reduction of cyclin b1 caused inhibition of proliferation by arresting cells in g2 phase and by inducing apoptosis. cells, entering mitosis, were impaired in chromosome condensation and alignment. importantly, hela cells with reduced cyclin b1 were more susceptible to the treatment of small interfering rna targeting polo-like kinase 1 (plk1) and to the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent taxol. finally, hela cells with reduced cyclin b1 showed inhibited tumor growth in nude mice compared to that of control cells. in summary, our data indicate that cyclin b1 is an essential molecule for tumor cell survival and aggressive proliferation, suggesting that the downregulation of cyclin b1, especially in combination with other molecular targets, might become an interesting strategy for antitumor intervention.
background exposure to ambient air pollution is suspected to cause cognitive effects, but a prospective cohort is needed to study exposure to air pollution at the home address and the incidence of dementia. objectives we aimed to assess the association between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and dementia incidence in a major city in northern sweden. methods data on dementia incidence over a 15-year period were obtained from the longitudinal betula study. traffic air pollution exposure was assessed using a land-use regression model with a spatial resolution of 50 m × 50 m. annual mean nitrogen oxide levels at the residential address of the participants at baseline (the start of follow-up) were used as markers for long-term exposure to air pollution. results out of 1,806 participants at baseline, 191 were diagnosed with alzheimer’s disease during follow-up, and 111 were diagnosed with vascular dementia. participants in the group with the highest exposure were more likely than those in the group with the lowest exposure to be diagnosed with dementia (alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia), with a hazard ratio (hr) of 1.43 (95% ci: 0.998, 2.05 for the highest vs. the lowest quartile). the estimates were similar for alzheimer’s disease (hr 1.38) and vascular dementia (hr 1.47). the hr for dementia associated with the third quartile versus the lowest quartile was 1.48 (95% ci: 1.03, 2.11). a subanalysis that excluded a younger sample that had been retested after only 5 years of follow-up suggested stronger associations with exposure than were present in the full cohort (hr = 1.71; 95% ci: 1.08, 2.73 for the highest vs. the lowest quartile). conclusions if the associations we observed are causal, then air pollution from traffic might be an important risk factor for vascular dementia and alzheimer’s disease. citation oudin a, forsberg b, nordin adolfsson a, lind n, modig l, nordin m, nordin s, adolfsson r, nilsson lg. 2016. traffic-related air pollution and dementia incidence in northern sweden: a longitudinal study. environ health perspect 124:306–312; http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1408322 background traffic-related particles induce oxidative stress and may exert adverse effects on central nervous system function, which could manifest as cognitive impairment. objective we assessed the association between black carbon (bc), a marker of traffic-related air pollution, and cognition in older men. methods a total of 680 men (mean ± sd, 71 ± 7 years of age) from the u.s. department of veterans affairs normative aging study completed a battery of seven cognitive tests at least once between 1996 and 2007. we assessed long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution using a validated spatiotemporal land-use regression model for bc. results the association between bc and cognition was nonlinear, and we log-transformed bc estimates for all analyses [ln(bc)]. in a multivariable-adjusted model, for each doubling in bc on the natural scale, the odds of having a mini-mental state examination (mmse) score ≤ 25 was 1.3 times higher [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.1 to 1.6]. in a multivariable-adjusted model for global cognitive function, which combined scores from the remaining six tests, a doubling of bc was associated with a 0.054 sd lower test score (95% ci, −0.103 to −0.006), an effect size similar to that observed with a difference in age of 1.9 years in our data. we found no evidence of heterogeneity by cognitive test. in sensitivity analyses adjusting for past lead exposure, the association with mmse scores was similar (odds ratio = 1.3; 95% ci, 1.1 to 1.7), but the association with global cognition was somewhat attenuated (−0.038 per doubling in bc; 95% ci, −0.089 to 0.012). conclusions ambient traffic-related air pollution was associated with decreased cognitive function in older men.
in the present study, causal roles of both the primary somatosensory cortex (si) and the posterior parietal cortex (ppc) were investigated in a tactile unimodal working memory (wm) task. individual magnetic resonance imaging‐based single‐pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (sptms) was applied, respectively, to the left si (ipsilateral to tactile stimuli), right si (contralateral to tactile stimuli) and right ppc (contralateral to tactile stimuli), while human participants were performing a tactile‐tactile unimodal delayed matching‐to‐sample task. the time points of sptms were 300, 600 and 900 ms after the onset of the tactile sample stimulus (duration: 200 ms). compared with ipsilateral si, application of sptms over either contralateral si or contralateral ppc at those time points significantly impaired the accuracy of task performance. meanwhile, the deterioration in accuracy did not vary with the stimulating time points. together, these results indicate that the tactile information is processed cooperatively by si and ppc in the same hemisphere, starting from the early delay of the tactile unimodal wm task. this pattern of processing of tactile information is different from the pattern in tactile‐visual cross‐modal wm. in a tactile‐visual cross‐modal wm task, si and ppc contribute to the processing sequentially, suggesting a process of sensory information transfer during the early delay between modalities. background both monkey neurophysiological and human eeg studies have shown that association cortices, as well as primary sensory cortical areas, play an essential role in sequential neural processes underlying cross-modal working memory.   objective the present study aims to further examine causal and sequential roles of the primary sensory cortex and association cortex in cross-modal working memory.   methods individual mri-based single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (sptms) was applied to bilateral primary somatosensory cortices (si) and the contralateral posterior parietal cortex (ppc), while participants were performing a tactile-visual cross-modal delayed matching-to-sample task. time points of sptms were 300 ms, 600 ms, 900 ms after the onset of the tactile sample stimulus in the task.   results the accuracy of task performance and reaction time were significantly impaired when sptms was applied to the contralateral si at 300 ms. significant impairment on performance accuracy was also observed when the contralateral ppc was stimulated at 600 ms.   conclusion si and ppc play sequential and distinct roles in neural processes of cross-modal associations and working memory.
microrna signatures of bal cells and alveolar macrophages are currently lacking in ipf. here we sought to investigate the expression of fibrosis-related micrornas in the cellular component of the bal in ipf. we thus focused on micrornas previously associated with fibrosis (mir-29a, mir-29b, mir-29c, let-7d, and mir-21) and rapid ipf progression (mir-185, mir-210, mir-302c-3p mir-376c and mir-423-5p). among the tested micrornas mir-29a and mir-185 were found significantly downregulated in ipf while mir-302c-3p and mir-376c were not expressed by bal cells. importantly, the downregulation of mir-29a inversely correlated with the significantly increased levels of col1a1 mrna in ipf bal cells. collagen 1 a was found mainly overexpressed in alveolar macrophages and not other cell types of the bal by immunofluorescence. in view of the downregulation of mir-185, we tested the response of thp-1 macrophages to profibrotic cytokine tgfb and observed the downregulation of mir-185. conversely, proinflammatory stimulation lead to mir-185 upregulation. upon examination of the mrna levels of known mir-185 targets akt1, dnmt1 and hmga2, no significant correlations were observed in the bal cells. however, increased levels of total akt and aktser473 phosphorylation were observed in the ipf bal cells. furthermore, mir-185 inhibition in thp-1 macrophages resulted in significant increase of aktser473 phosphorylation. our study highlights the importance of bal microrna signatures in ipf and identifies significant differences in mir-185/akt and mir-29a/collagen axes in the bal cells of ipf patients. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a chronic, progressive, and highly lethal fibrotic lung disease with poor treatment and unknown etiology. emerging evidence suggests that epithelial–mesenchymal transition (emt) has an important role in repair and scar formation following epithelial injury during pulmonary fibrosis. although some mirnas have been shown to be dysregulated in the pathophysiological processes of ipf, limited studies have payed attention on the participation of mirnas in emt in lung fibrosis. in our study, we identified and constructed a regulation network of differentially expressed ipf mirnas and emt genes. additionally, we found the downregulation of mir-26a in mice with experimental pulmonary fibrosis. further studies showed that mir-26a regulated hmga2, which is a key factor in the process of emt and had the maximum number of regulating mirnas in the regulation network. more importantly, inhibition of mir-26a resulted in lung epithelial cells transforming into myofibroblasts in vitro and in vivo, whereas forced expression of mir-26a alleviated tgf-β1- and blm-induced emt in a549 cells and in mice, respectively. taken together, our study deciphered the essential role of mir-26a in the pathogenesis of emt in pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that mir-26a may be a potential therapeutic target for ipf.
progesterone and its interaction with nuclear progesterone receptors (pr), pr-a and pr-b, play a critical role in the regulation of female reproductive function in all mammals. however, our knowledge of the regulation and possible cellular function of pr protein isoforms in the fallopian tube and uterus in vivo is still very limited. in the present study, we revealed that equine gonadotropin (ecg) treatment resulted in a timedependent increase in expression of both isoforms, reaching a maximal level at 48 h in the fallopian tube. regulation of pr-a protein expression paralleled that of pr-b protein expression. however, in the uterus, pr-b protein levels increased and peaked earlier than pr-a protein levels after ecg treatment. with prolonged exposure to ecg, pr-b protein levels decreased whereas pr-a protein levels continued to increase. furthermore, subsequent treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) decreased the levels of pr protein isoforms in both tissues in parallel with increased endogenous serum progesterone levels. to further elucidate whether progesterone regulates pr protein isoforms, we demonstrated that a time-dependent treatment with p4 decreased the expression of pr protein isoforms in both tissues, whereas decreases in p27, cyclin d2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein levels were only observed in uterus. to define the potential pr-mediated effects on apoptosis, we demonstrated that the pr antagonist treatment increased the levels of pr protein isoforms, induced mitochondrialassociated apoptosis, and decreased in epidermal growth factor (egf) and egf receptor protein expression in both tissues. interestingly, immunohistochemistry indicated that the induction of apoptosis by pr antagonists was predominant in the epithelium, whereas increase in pr protein expression was observed in stromal cells of both tissues. taken together, these observations suggest that (1) the tissue-specific and hormonal regulation of pr isoform expression in mouse fallopian tube and uterus, where they are potentially involved in regulation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis depending on the cellular compartment; (2) a possible interaction between functional pr protein and growth factor signaling may have a coordinated role for regulating apoptotic process in both tissues in vivo. two anti-progesterone receptor (pgr) antibodies, a new one specific to pgrb, the other to pgr subtypes a + b, have been used to examine the cellular location of pgr subtypes a and b in normal endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle and in early human decidua by standard immunohistochemical techniques. pgr(a+b) is the receptor detected by the antibody recognizing both isoforms of the receptor. pgrb is the receptor detected by the new antibody specific to the b isoform. since it is not possible to raise antibody specific to pgr subtype a, all immunohistochemical analysis of the pgra subtype is by subtractive inference. thus we refer to pgra as the subtype responsible for positive immunoreactivity when the pgrb subtype cannot be specifically detected. endometrial biopsies were collected from 40 women with regular menses (n = 5 each stage of cycle: menstrual; early, mid and late proliferative; ovulatory; early, mid, and late secretory). decidual tissue was obtained from 10 women undergoing first trimester surgical termination of pregnancy. as previously reported, the pgr(a+b) antibody stained glandular and stromal nuclei during the proliferative phase but only stromal nuclei during the secretory phase and early pregnancy. the new pgrb antibody also stained both cell types intensely during the proliferative phase, but failed to stain either stromal or glandular nuclei strongly during the secretory phase and early pregnancy. we concluded that, while both pgr subtypes were present in glands and stroma in the proliferative phase, and both subtypes were dramatically reduced in the glands during the secretory phase, pgra remained as the predominant type in the stroma during the secretory phase and early pregnancy. the profound effects of progesterone on endometrium during the secretory phase and early pregnancy appear to be mediated primarily by pgra in the stroma.
the prevalence of gallstones in patients with barrett’s esophagus (be) and their gallbladder motility relative to that of healthy volunteers and gerd patients without be were investigated. of the 707 patients reviewed, 203 (125 males and 78 females) had be. the prevalence of gallstones was significantly higher in the patients with be than in those without be (34 vs. 20%, respectively). the gallbladder functions of 22 patients with gerd, 27 patients with be and 21 healthy volunteers were assessed by ultrasonography before and after a test meal. the patients with be had significantly higher fasting volume and residual volume, but lower ejection volume, ejection fraction and ejection rate values than those of the healthy controls. none of the ultrasonographic parameters of patients without be were significantly different from those of the controls. patients with be have a more complex gastrointestinal motility disorder that involves the gallbladder, and this makes this subset of patients with gerd more prone to gallstone disease. objectives:gallstones and hiatal hernia reportedly have been linked to similar dietary factors prevalent in western countries, and patients with cholelithiasis or previous cholecystectomy have been reported to have more duodenogastric reflux than healthy controls. nonetheless, the contribution of duodenogastric reflux to the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) remains controversial. the present study was aimed to assess the association between gallstone disease and gerd.methods:outpatients from general medical clinics who underwent upper gi endoscopy and abdominal ultrasonography were recruited into a case-control study. a case population of 790 patients with various grades of gerd was compared to a control population of 407 patients without gerd. in a multivariate logistic regression, the presence of gerd served as the outcome variable, whereas the presence of gallstones, hiatal hernia, social habits, and demographic characteristics served as predictor variables.results:no associations were found between the presence of cholelithiasis or previous cholecystectomy and gerd or between the presence of cholelithiasis or previous cholecystectomy and hiatal hernia. the severity of gerd also remained unaffected by the presence of gallstones. the occurrence of gerd was influenced only by hiatal hernia (odds ratio [or] = 3.15, 95% ci = 2.44–4.08), alcohol consumption (or = 1.47, ci = 1.08–1.99), and not by cholelithiasis (or = 1.02, ci = 0.68–1.51), or cholecystectomy (or = 0.90, ci = 0.64–1.28). the frequency of gerd among hiatus hernia patients with gallstones (437/592 = 74%) was similar to the frequency of gerd among hiatus hernia patients without gallstones (168/220 = 76%, p = 0.516).conclusions:neither cholelithiasis nor cholecystectomy poses a risk for the occurrence of gerd or hiatal hernia. gallstone disease does not seem to influence the integrity of the esophageal mucosa through gerd.
selective sampling, a realistic active learning model, has received recent attention in the learning theory literature. while the analysis of selective sampling is still in its infancy, we focus here on one of the (seemingly) simplest problems that. remain open. given a pool of unlabeled examples, drawn i.i.d. from an arbitrary input distribution known to the learner, and oracle access to their labels, the objective is to achieve a target error-rate with minimum label-complexity, via an efficient algorithm. no prior distribution is assumed over the concept class, however the problem remains open even under the realizability assumption: there exists a target hypothesis in the concept class that perfectly classifies all examples, and the labeling oracle is noiseless. 1 as a precise variant of the problem, we consider the case of learning homogeneous half-spaces in the realizable setting: unlabeled examples, x t , are drawn i.i.d. from a known distribution d over the surface of the unit ball in r d and labels y t are either -1 or +1. the target function is a half-space u.x > 0 represented by a unit vector u ∈ r d such that y t (u.x t ) > 0 for all t. we denote a hypothesis v's prediction as v(x) = sgn(υ .x). problem: provide an algorithm for active learning of half-spaces, such that (with high probability with respect to d and any internal randomness): 1. after l label queries, algorithm's hypothesis υ obeys p x∼d [υ(x)¬= u(x)] < e. 2. l is at most the pac sample complexity of the supervised problem, o(d elog 1 e), and for a general class of input distributions, l is significantly lower. 2 3. total running time is at most poly(d,1 e). we state and analyze the first active learning algorithm which works in the presence of arbitrary forms of noise. the algorithm, a2 (for agnostic active), relies only upon the assumption that the samples are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution. we show that a2 achieves an exponential improvement (i.e., requires only o (ln 1/ε) samples to find an ε-optimal classifier) over the usual sample complexity of supervised learning, for several settings considered before in the realizable case. these include learning threshold classifiers and learning homogeneous linear separators with respect to an input distribution which is uniform over the unit sphere.
in digital games goal recognition centers on identifying the concrete objectives that a player is attempting identifying the concrete objectives that a player is attempting to achieve given a domain model and a sequence of actions in a virtual environment. goal-recognition models in open-ended digital games introduce opportunities for adapting gameplay events based on the choices of individual players, as well as interpreting player behaviors during post hoc data mining analyses. however, goal recognition in open-ended games poses significant computational challenges, including inherent uncertainty, exploratory actions, and ill-defined goals. this chapter reports on an investigation of markov logic networks (mlns) for recognizing player goals in open-ended digital game environments with exploratory actions. the goal-recognition model was trained on a corpus collected from player interactions with an open-ended game-based learning environment known as c rystal i sland . we present experimental results, in which the goal-recognition model was compared to n -gram models. the findings suggest the proposed goal-recognition model yields significant accuracy gains beyond the n -gram models for predicting player goals in an open-ended digital game. goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
background: glycine receptors mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. results: syndapin i is a new interaction partner of the glycine receptor β subunit, and its down-regulation reduces synaptic glycine receptor levels. conclusion: syndapin i is involved in glycine receptor trafficking to and/or anchoring at inhibitory postsynapses. significance: disclosing new determinants of glycine receptor clustering is crucial for understanding inhibitory synapse formation. glycine receptors (glyrs) mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in spinal cord and brainstem. they are clustered at inhibitory postsynapses via a tight interaction of their β subunits (glyrβ) with the scaffolding protein gephyrin. in an attempt to isolate additional proteins interacting with glyrβ, we performed pulldown experiments with rat brain extracts using a glutathione s-transferase fusion protein encompassing amino acids 378–455 of the large intracellular loop of glyrβ as bait. this identified syndapin i (sdpi) as a novel interaction partner of glyrβ that coimmunoprecipitates with native glyrs from brainstem extracts. both sdpi and sdpii bound efficiently to the intracellular loop of glyrβ in vitro and colocalized with glyrβ upon coexpression in cos-7 cells. the sdpi-binding site was mapped to a proline-rich sequence of 22 amino acids within the intracellular loop of glyrβ. deletion and point mutation analysis disclosed that sdpi binding to glyrβ is src homology 3 domain-dependent. in cultured rat spinal cord neurons, sdpi immunoreactivity was found to partially colocalize with marker proteins of inhibitory and excitatory synapses. when sdpi was acutely knocked down in cultured spinal cord neurons by viral mirna expression, postsynaptic glyr clusters were significantly reduced in both size and number. similar changes in glyr cluster properties were found in spinal cultures from sdpi-deficient mice. our results are consistent with a role of sdpi in the trafficking and/or cytoskeletal anchoring of synaptic glyrs. synaptic transmission relies on effective and accurate compensatory endocytosis. f‐bar proteins may serve as membrane curvature sensors and/or inducers and thereby support membrane remodelling processes; yet, their in vivo functions urgently await disclosure. we demonstrate that the f‐bar protein syndapin i is crucial for proper brain function. syndapin i knockout (ko) mice suffer from seizures, a phenotype consistent with excessive hippocampal network activity. loss of syndapin i causes defects in presynaptic membrane trafficking processes, which are especially evident under high‐capacity retrieval conditions, accumulation of endocytic intermediates, loss of synaptic vesicle (sv) size control, impaired activity‐dependent sv retrieval and defective synaptic activity. detailed molecular analyses demonstrate that syndapin i plays an important role in the recruitment of all dynamin isoforms, central players in vesicle fission reactions, to the membrane. consistently, syndapin i ko mice share phenotypes with dynamin i ko mice, whereas their seizure phenotype is very reminiscent of fitful mice expressing a mutant dynamin. thus, syndapin i acts as pivotal membrane anchoring factor for dynamins during regeneration of svs.
nematostella vectensis is an infaunal anemone occurring in salt marshes, lagoons and other estuarine habitats in north america and the united kingdom. although it is considered rare and receives protection in england, it is widely distributed and abundant in the united states, particularly along the atlantic coast. recent studies suggest that both anthropogenic dispersal and reproductive plasticity may significantly influence the genetic structure of n. vectensis populations. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting of individuals from nine populations in the northeastern united states indicates that stable populations are maintained by both asexual and sexual reproduction; in some cases asexually reproducing lineages exist within sexually reproducing populations. f statistics reveal extraordinarily high degrees of genetic differentiation between populations, even those separated by very short distances (less than 100 m). genetic distances show little to no correlation with geographical distances, consistent with a role for sporadic, geographically discontinuous dispersal coupled with limited gene flow. no single genotype was found at more than one site, despite apparent homogeneity of habitat. in contrast with reported genotypic distributions for nematostella in the united kingdom, where a single clonal genotype dominates at multiple sites through southern england, our data thus fail to support the hypothesis of a general‐purpose genotype in the northeastern united states. however, they are consistent with important roles for reproductive plasticity, sporadic introductions and complex local population dynamics in determining the global and regional distribution of this species. molecular markers derived from polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of genomic dna are an important part of the toolkit of evolutionary geneticists. random amplified polymorphic dna markers (rapds), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (aflps) and intersimple sequence repeat (issr) polymorphisms allow analysis of species for which previous dna sequence information is lacking, but dominance makes it impossible to apply standard techniques to calculate f‐statistics. we describe a bayesian method that allows direct estimates of fst from dominant markers. in contrast to existing alternatives, we do not assume previous knowledge of the degree of within‐population inbreeding. in particular, we do not assume that genotypes within populations are in hardy–weinberg proportions. our estimate of fst incorporates uncertainty about the magnitude of within‐population inbreeding. simulations show that samples from even a relatively small number of loci and populations produce reliable estimates of fst. moreover, some information about the degree of within‐population inbreeding (fis) is available from data sets with a large number of loci and populations. we illustrate the method with a reanalysis of rapd data from 14 populations of a north american orchid, platanthera leucophaea.
there is an urgent global need for effective and affordable approaches to cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. in developing nations, cervical malignancies remain the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. this reality may be difficult to accept given that these deaths are largely preventable; where cervical screening programs have been implemented, cervical cancer-related deaths have decreased dramatically. in developed countries, the challenges of cervical disease stem from high costs and overtreatment. the national cancer institute-funded program project is evaluating the applicability of optical technologies in cervical cancer. the mandate of the project is to create tools for disease detection and diagnosis that are inexpensive, require minimal expertise, are more accurate than existing modalities, and can be feasibly implemented in a variety of clinical settings. this article presents the status and long-term goals of the project. objective this review evaluates the diagnostic efficacy of fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, and their combination that use both point probe and multispectral imaging approaches in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo.   methods articles were selected for this review from a literature search which report the performance of fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy devices in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo. this analysis focused on the comparison of point probe versus multispectral approaches; the use of fluorescence, reflectance, and their combination; and finally the types of populations that have been studied for in vivo diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (sil).   results twenty-six studies were included and their heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analysis. though point probes were expected to have greater specificity and multispectral approaches greater sensitivity, there was considerable overlap in the performance of point probe and multispectral devices. there were few studies that studied fluorescence spectroscopy alone and reflectance spectroscopy alone. combined fluorescence and reflectance approaches showed considerable overlap among point probe and multispectral devices. the overlap of performance suggests that fluorescence and reflectance may have similar performance. currently the paucity of data precludes definitive conclusions regarding the additive effect of both approaches. only two of twenty-six trials have recruited patients with no history of an abnormal papanicolaou smear (screening populations) and twenty-four trials include patients with a range of cervical abnormalities from atypia to cancer (diagnostic populations).   discussion optical spectroscopy using a point probe and multispectral approaches appears to overlap in performance. fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopies examine different aspects of epithelial-stromal biology and appear to yield similar diagnostic performance. while intuitively appealing, their combination may or may not be additive. there have been few studies of these technologies in screening populations. better definitions of device trial design and reporting requirements would facilitate combining analyses to formally examine performance.
background:azd1152, the prodrug for azd1152-hydroxyquinazoline pyrazol anilide (hqpa), is a selective inhibitor of aurora b kinase activity. preclinical evaluation of azd1152 has been reported in several human cancer models. the potentiality of this compound in combination therapy warrants further investigation in solid tumours.experimental design:this study explored the effects of azd1152-hqpa in colon and pancreatic tumour cells. the antitumour properties of azd1152, either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutics, were evaluated in each study model. the efficacy and the toxicity of azd1152 alone and in combination with gemcitabine were validated in pancreatic tumour xenograft model.results:azd1152-hqpa treatment resulted in a dramatic increase of chromosome number, modification of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. the most effective combination was that with chemotherapeutics given soon after azd1152 in both tumour cell types. the effectiveness of the sequential schedule of azd1152 with gemcitabine was confirmed in nude mice bearing miapaca-2 tumours, showing inhibition of tumour volumes and delaying of tumour growth after the interruption of the treatments.conclusion:here we show that azd1152-hqpa enhances oxaliplatin and gemcitabine effectiveness in colon and pancreatic cancer, respectively. first, we provide advances into administration schedules and dosing regimens for the combination treatment in in vivo pancreatic tumour. aurora kinases play a critical role in regulating mitosis and cell division, and their overexpression has been implicated in the survival and proliferation of human cancer. in this study, we report the in vitro and in vivo activities of azd1152, a compound that has selectivity for aurora b kinase, in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) cell lines, primary aml samples, and cord blood cells. azd1152 exerted antiproliferative or cytotoxic effects in all cell lines studied, inhibited the phosphorylation of histone h3 (phis h3) on ser10 in a dose-dependent manner, and resulted in cells with >4n dna content. thp-1 cells treated with azd1152 accumulated in a state of polyploidy and showed a senescent response to the drug, in contrast to the apoptotic response seen in other cell lines. accordingly, azd1152 profoundly affected the growth of aml cell lines and primary aml in an in vivo xenotransplantation model. however, concentration-dependent effects on cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were also observed when human cord blood and primary lineage-negative stem and progenitor cells were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. these data suggest that the inhibition of aurora b kinase may be a useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of aml and that further exploration of dosing and treatment schedules is warranted in clinical trials.
backgroundatherosclerosis is an inflammatory process of the arterial walls and is initiated by endothelial dysfunction accompanied by an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no). sildenafil, a selective phosphodiesterase-5 (pde5) inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction, exerts its cardiovascular effects by enhancing the effects of no. the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of sildenafil on endothelial function and atherosclerosis progression in apolipoprotein e knockout (apoe−/−) mice.methodsapoe−/− mice treated with sildenafil (viagra®, 40 mg/kg/day, for 3 weeks, by oral gavage) were compared to the untreated apoe−/− and the wild-type (wt) mice.aortic rings were used to evaluate the relaxation responses to acetylcholine (ach) in all of the groups. in a separate set of experiments, the roles of no and ros in the relaxation response to ach were evaluated by incubating the aortic rings with l-name (no synthase inhibitor) or apocynin (nadph oxidase inhibitor). in addition, the atherosclerotic lesions were quantified and superoxide production was assessed.resultssildenafil restored the vasodilator response to acetylcholine (ach) in the aortic rings of the apoe−/− mice. treatment with l-name abolished the vasodilator responses to ach in all three groups of mice and revealed an augmented participation of no in the endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the sildenafil-treated animals. the normalized endothelial function in sildenafil-treated apoe−/− mice was unaffected by apocynin highlighting the low levels of ros production in these animals. moreover, morphological analysis showed that sildenafil treatment caused approximately a 40% decrease in plaque deposition in the aorta.conclusionthis is the first study demonstrating the beneficial effects of chronic treatment with sildenafil on endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in a model of spontaneous hypercholesterolemia. these data indicate that the main mechanism of the beneficial effect of sildenafil on the endothelial function appears to involve an enhancement of the no pathway along with a reduction in oxidative stress. hypercholesterolemia is associated with impaired neovascularization in response to ischemia. potential mechanisms include defective no bioactivity and a reduction in the number/function of endothelial progenitor cells (epcs). here we tested the hypothesis that sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor that increases no-driven cgmp levels, could stimulate epc function and improve ischemia-induced neovascularization in hypercholesterolemic conditions. apolipoprotein e–deficient (apoe−/−) mice were treated (or not treated) with sildenafil (40 mg/kg per day in water), and hindlimb ischemia was surgically induced by femoral artery removal. sildenafil treatment led to an improved blood flow recovery, an increased capillary density, and a reduction of oxidative stress levels in ischemic muscles at day 7 after surgery. sildenafil therapy is associated with an increased activation of angiogenic transduction pathways, including akt, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p38. in vitro, sildenafil increases cellular migration and tubule formation of mature endothelial cells (human umbilical vascular endothelial cells) in a cgmp-dependent manner. in vivo, apoe−/− mice treated with sildenafil exhibit a significant increase in the number of bone marrow–derived epcs. moreover, the angiogenic activities of epcs (migration and adhesion) are significantly improved in apoe−/− mice treated with sildenafil. in summary, this study demonstrates that sildenafil treatment is associated with improved ischemia-induced neovascularization in hypercholesterolemic apoe−/− mice. the mechanisms involve beneficial effects on angiogenic transduction pathways together with an increase in the number and the functional activity of epcs. sildenafil could constitute a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce tissue ischemia in atherosclerotic diseases.
the storage of erythrocyte concentrates (ecs) induces lesions that notably affect metabolism, protein activity, deformability of red blood cells (rbcs), as well as the release of oxygen. band 3 is one of the proteins affected during the ex vivo aging of rbcs. this membrane protein is an anion transporter, an anchor site for the cytoskeleton and other membrane proteins as well as a binding site for glycolytic enzymes and bears blood group antigens. in the present study, band 3 complexes were isolated from rbcs stored for 7 and 42 days in average (n = 3), as well as from microvesicles (n = 3). after extraction of membrane proteins with a deoxycholate containing buffer, band 3 complexes were co-immunoprecipitated on magnetic beads coated with two anti-band 3 antibodies. both total membrane protein extracts and eluates (containing band 3 complexes) were separated on sds-page and analyzed by bottom-up proteomics. it revealed that three proteins were present or absent in band 3 complexes stemming from long-stored or short-stored ecs, respectively, whereas the membrane protein contents remained equivalent. these potential markers for storage-induced rbc aging are adenylosuccinate lyase (adsl), α-adducin and flotillin-2, and were further analyzed using western blots. adsl abundance tended to increase during storage in both total membrane protein and band 3 complexes, whereas α-adducin mainly tended to stay onto the membrane extract. interestingly, flotillin-2 was equivalently present in total membrane proteins whereas it clearly co-immunoprecipitated with band 3 complexes during storage (1.6-fold-change, p = 0.0024). moreover, flotillin-2 was enriched (almost threefold) in rbcs compared to microvesicles (mvs) (p < 0.001) and the amount found in mvs was associated to band 3 complexes. different types of band 3 complexes are known to exist in rbcs and further studies will be required to better understand involvement of this protein in microvesiculation during the storage of rbcs. the redistribution of surface membrane immunoglobulin (smig) and concanavalin a (con-a) was studied in peripheral mononuclear cells of three patients who had hairy cell leukemia. fluorescein-labeled polyvalent goat antihuman immunoglobulin and fluoresceinated con-a were used as ligands. the capping of ligand-receptor complexes was temperature-dependent and was more prominent at 37 c. a significant drop in the percentages of smig and con-a capping was observed when cytochalasin b was added. in contrast, no decline in the percentages of smig and con-a capping was seen in the presence of colchicine. the inhibitory action of cytochalasin b on the capping of smig and con-a receptors in hairy cells suggests that these receptors are integral macromolecules of the plasma membrane and their redistribution is regulated by cytoskeletal structures.
this paper presents a new formulation of the problem of motion estimation which attempts to give solutions to classical problems in the field, such as detection of motion discontinuities and insufficiency of the optical flow constraint in areas with low intensity variation. an initial intensity segmentation phase partitions each frame into patches so that areas with low intensity variation are guaranteed to belong to the same patch. a parametric model is assumedto describe the motion of each patch. regularization in the motion parameter space provides the additional constraints for patches where the intensity variation is insufficient to constrain the estimation of the motion parameters and smooths the corresponding motion field. in orderto preserve motion discontinuities we use robust functions as a regularization mean. experimental results show that the proposed method deals successfully with motions large in magnitude, motion discontinuities and produces accurate piecewise smooth motion fields. this paper presents a new model for estimating optical flow based on the motion of planar regions plus local deformations. the approach exploits brightness information to organize and constrain the interpretation of the motion by using segmented regions of piecewise smooth brightness to hypothesize planar regions in the scene. parametric flow models are estimated in these regions in a two step process which first computes a coarse fit and then estimates the appropriate parametrization of the motion of the region. the initial fit is refined using a generalization of the standard area-based regression approaches. since the assumption of planarity is likely to be violated, we allow local deformations from the planar assumption in the same spirit as physically-based approaches which model shape using coarse parametric models plus local deformations. this parametric plus deformation model exploits the strong constraints of parametric approaches while retaining the adaptive nature of regularization approaches. experimental results on a variety of images model produces accurate flow estimates while the incorporation of brightness segmentation boundaries.
objective using three risk-adjustment methods we evaluated whether co-morbidity derived from electronic hospital patient data provided significant improvement on age adjustment when predicting major outcomes following an elective total joint replacement (tjr) due to osteoarthritis.   methods longitudinal data from 819 elderly men who had had a tjr were integrated with hospital morbidity data (hmd) and mortality records. for each participant, any morbidity or health-related outcome was retrieved from the linked data in the period 1970 through to 2007 and this enabled us to better account for patient co-morbidities. co-morbidities recorded in the hmd in all admissions preceding the index tjr admission were used to construct three risk-adjustment methods, namely charlson co-morbidity index (cci), elixhauser's adjustment method, and number of co-morbidities. postoperative outcomes evaluated included length of hospital stay, 90-day readmission, and 1-year and 2-year mortality. these were modelled using cox proportional hazards regression as a function of age for the baseline models, and as a function of age and each of the risk-adjustment methods. the difference in the statistical performance between the models that included age alone and those that also included the co-morbidity adjustment method was assessed by measuring the difference in the harrell's c estimates between pairs of models applied to the same patient data using bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications.   results number of co-morbidities did not provide any significant improvement in model discrimination when added to baseline models observed in all outcomes. cci significantly improved model discrimination when predicting post-operative mortality but not when length of stay or readmission was modelled. for every one point increase in cci, postoperative 1- and 2-year mortality increased by 37% and 30%, respectively. elixhauser's method outperformed the other two providing significant improvement on age adjustment in all outcomes.   conclusion the predictive performance of co-morbidity derived from electronic hospital data is outcome and risk-adjustment method specific. objective to assess the associations of smoking, body weight, and physical activity with risk of undergoing total joint replacement (tjr) in a population-based cohort of men.   methods a cohort study of 11,388 men that integrated clinical data with hospital morbidity data and mortality records was undertaken. the risk of undergoing tjr was modeled on baseline weight, height, comorbidity, socioeconomic status, years of smoking, and exercise in 3 separate age groups, using cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk regressions (crrs).   results dose-response relationships between weight and risk of tjr and between smoking and risk of tjr were observed. being overweight independently increased the risk of tjr, while smoking lowered the risk. the decreased risk among smokers was demonstrated in both cox and crr models and became apparent after 23 years of exposure. men who were in the highest quartile (≥48 years of smoking) were 42-51% less likely to undergo tjr than men who had never smoked. tests for trend in the log hazard ratios (hrs) across both smoking and weight quantiles yielded significant p values. vigorous exercise increased the hazard of tjr; however, the association reached statistical significance only in the 70-74-year-old age group (adjusted hr 1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.19-2.24]). adjusting for deyo-charlson index or elixhauser's comorbidity measures did not eliminate these associations.   conclusion our findings indicate that being overweight and reporting vigorous physical activity increase the risk of tjr. this study is the first to demonstrate a strong inverse dose-response relationship between duration of smoking and risk of tjr. more research is needed to better understand the role of smoking in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.
understanding how landscape structure shapes the genetic structure of populations of keystone species is important for their long-term management. we tested the unidirectional dispersal hypothesis on the linear river landscape of the wouri river and the one catchment-one gene pool hypothesis on red mangrove (rhizophora racemosa) populations of the cameroon estuary complex. therefore, we conducted release–recapture experiments in the field, and sampled 649 adult trees for plant material for genetic analyses. this allowed for estimating genetic diversity and structure, as well as dispersal directionality. genetic diversity in populations downstream did not differ significantly from upstream populations and the molecular variance of populations did not correlate with their position on the linear landscape. contemporary and historical migration estimates indicated bidirectional dispersal, i.e. in both the downstream and the upstream direction along the wouri river. this was confirmed by the propagule dispersal directions derived from our field experiments. bayesian clustering analysis assigned all individuals of this estuary into one cluster, suggesting high inter-catchment connectivity. river flow currents, tides, and wind plausibly operate together to ensure the high genetic connectivity within this complex estuary. backgroundmangroves are ecologically important and highly threatened forest communities. observational and genetic evidence has confirmed the long distance dispersal capacity of water-dispersed mangrove seeds, but less is known about the relative importance of pollen vs. seed gene flow in connecting populations. we analyzed 980 avicennia germinans for 11 microsatellite loci and 940 rhizophora mangle for six microsatellite loci and subsampled two non-coding cpdna regions in order to understand population structure, and gene flow within and among four major estuaries on the caribbean and pacific coasts of panama.resultsboth species showed similar rates of outcrossing (t= 0.7 in a. germinans and 0.8 in r. mangle) and strong patterns of spatial genetic structure within estuaries, although a. germinans had greater genetic structure in nuclear and cpdna markers (7 demes > 4 demes and sp= 0.02 > 0.002), and much greater cpdna diversity (hd= 0.8 > 0.2) than r. mangle. the central american isthmus serves as an exceptionally strong barrier to gene flow, with high levels nuclear (fst= 0.3-0.5) and plastid (fst= 0.5-0.8) genetic differentiation observed within each species between coasts and no shared cpdna haplotypes between species on each coast. finally, evidence of low ratios of pollen to seed dispersal (r = −0.6 in a. germinans and 7.7 in r. mangle), coupled with the strong observed structure in nuclear and plastid dna among most estuaries, suggests low levels of gene flow in these mangrove species.conclusionswe conclude that gene dispersal in mangroves is usually limited within estuaries and that coastal geomorphology and rare long distance dispersal events could also influence levels of structure.
abstract sexual selection may cause dietary requirements for reproduction to diverge across the sexes and promote the evolution of different foraging strategies in males and females. however, our understanding of how the sexes regulate their nutrition and the effects that this has on sex‐specific fitness is limited. we quantified how protein (p) and carbohydrate (c) intakes affect reproductive traits in male (pheromone expression) and female (clutch size and gestation time) cockroaches (nauphoeta cinerea). we then determined how the sexes regulate their intake of nutrients when restricted to a single diet and when given dietary choice and how this affected expression of these important reproductive traits. pheromone levels that improve male attractiveness, female clutch size and gestation time all peaked at a high daily intake of p:c in a 1:8 ratio. this is surprising because female insects typically require more p than males to maximize reproduction. the relatively low p requirement of females may reflect the action of cockroach endosymbionts that help recycle stored nitrogen for protein synthesis. when constrained to a single diet, both sexes prioritized regulating their daily intake of p over c, although this prioritization was stronger in females than males. when given the choice between diets, both sexes actively regulated their intake of nutrients at a 1:4.8 p:c ratio. the p:c ratio did not overlap exactly with the intake of nutrients that optimized reproductive trait expression. despite this, cockroaches of both sexes that were given dietary choice generally improved the mean and reduced the variance in all reproductive traits we measured relative to animals fed a single diet from the diet choice pair. this pattern was not as strong when compared to the single best diet in our geometric array, suggesting that the relationship between nutrient balancing and reproduction is complex in this species. summary metabolic rate varies significantly between individuals, and these differences persist even when the wide range of biotic and abiotic factors that influence metabolism are accounted for. it is important to understand the life history implications of variation in metabolic rate, but they remain poorly characterised despite a growing body of work examining relationships between metabolism and a range of traits. in the present study we used laboratory-bred families (one sire to three dams) of nauphoeta cinerea (olivier) (speckled cockroaches) to examine the relationship between standard metabolic rate (smr) and reproductive performance (number of offspring and gestation duration). we show that smr is negatively associated with female gestation duration. age at mating is negatively associated with gestation duration for females, and mass is negatively associated with the average gestation duration of the females a male was mated with. in addition to the results in the current literature, the results from the present study suggest that the association between metabolism and life history is more complex than simple relationships between metabolism and various fitness traits. future work should consider longitudinal, ontogenetic as well as selective and quantitative genetic breeding approaches to fully examine the associations between metabolism and fitness.
cochlear outer hair cells (ohcs) are fast biological motors that serve to enhance the vibration of the organ of corti and increase the sensitivity of the inner ear to sound. exactly how ohcs produce useful mechanical power at auditory frequencies, given their intrinsic biophysical properties, has been a subject of considerable debate. to address this we formulated a mathematical model of the ohc based on first principles and analyzed the power conversion efficiency in the frequency domain. the model includes a mixture-composite constitutive model of the active lateral wall and spatially distributed electro-mechanical fields. the analysis predicts that: 1) the peak power efficiency is likely to be tuned to a specific frequency, dependent upon ohc length, and this tuning may contribute to the place principle and frequency selectivity in the cochlea; 2) the ohc power output can be detuned and attenuated by increasing the basal conductance of the cell, a parameter likely controlled by the brain via the efferent system; and 3) power output efficiency is limited by mechanical properties of the load, thus suggesting that impedance of the organ of corti may be matched regionally to the ohc. the high power efficiency, tuning, and efferent control of outer hair cells are the direct result of biophysical properties of the cells, thus providing the physical basis for the remarkable sensitivity and selectivity of hearing. 1. the microchamber method was used to examine the motile responses of isolated guinea pig outer hair cells to electrical stimulation. in the microchamber method, an isolated cell is drawn partway into a suction pipette and stimulated transcellularly. the relative position of the cell in the microchamber is referred to as the exclusion fraction. 2. the length changes of the included and excluded segments were compared for constant sinusoidal stimulus amplitude as functions of the exclusion fraction. both included and excluded segments showed maximal responses when the cell was excluded approximately halfway. both segments showed smaller or absent responses when the cell was almost fully excluded or almost fully included. 3. when the cell was near to, but not at, the maximum exclusion, the included segment response amplitude was zero, whereas the excluded segment response amplitude was nonzero. in contrast, when the cell was nearly fully included, the excluded segment response amplitude was zero, but the included segment response amplitude was still detectable. a simple model of outer hair cell motility based on these results suggests that the cell has finite-resistance terminations and that the motors are restricted to a region above the nucleus and below its ciliated apex (cuticular plate). 4. the function describing length change as a function of command voltage was measured for each segment as the exclusion fraction was varied. the functions were similar at midrange exclusions (i.e., when the segments were about equal length), showing nonlinearity and saturability. the functions were strikingly different when the segment lengths were different. the effects of exclusion on the voltage to length-change functions suggested that the nonlinearity and saturability are local properties of the motility mechanism. 5. the diameter changes of both segments were examined. the segment diameter changes were always antiphasic to the length changes. this finding implies that the motility mechanism has an active antiphasic diameter component. the diameter change amplitude was a monotonically increasing function of exclusion for the included segment, and a decreasing function for the excluded segment. 6. the voltage to length-change and voltage to diameter-change functions were measured for the same cell and exclusion fraction. the voltage to diameter-change function was smaller in amplitude than the voltage to length-change function. the functions were of opposite polarity to each other, but were otherwise similar in character. thus it is likely that the same motor mechanism is responsible for both axial and diameter deformations.
huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a cag repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. the peripheral innate immune system contributes to huntington's disease pathogenesis and has been targeted successfully to modulate disease progression, but mechanistic understanding relating this to mutant huntingtin expression in immune cells has been lacking. here we demonstrate that human huntington's disease myeloid cells produce excessive inflammatory cytokines as a result of the cell-intrinsic effects of mutant huntingtin expression. a direct effect of mutant huntingtin on the nfκb pathway, whereby it interacts with ikkγ, leads to increased degradation of iκb and subsequent nuclear translocation of rela. transcriptional alterations in intracellular immune signalling pathways are also observed. using a novel method of small interfering rna delivery to lower huntingtin expression, we show reversal of disease-associated alterations in cellular function-the first time this has been demonstrated in primary human cells. glucan-encapsulated small interfering rna particles were used to lower huntingtin levels in human huntington's disease monocytes/macrophages, resulting in a reversal of huntingtin-induced elevated cytokine production and transcriptional changes. these findings improve our understanding of the role of innate immunity in neurodegeneration, introduce glucan-encapsulated small interfering rna particles as tool for studying cellular pathogenesis ex vivo in human cells and raise the prospect of immune cell-directed htt-lowering as a therapeutic in huntington's disease. nature genetics advance online publication we undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (gwas) of alzheimer’s disease (ad) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful ad gwas to date. in stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein e (apoe) locus (most significant snp, rs2075650, p = 1.8 × 10−157) and observed genome-wide significant association with snps at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the clu (also known as apoj) gene (rs11136000, p = 1.4 × 10−9) and 5 to the picalm gene (rs3851179, p = 1.9 × 10−8). these associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with alzheimer’s disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, p = 8.5 × 10−10, odds ratio = 0.86; rs3851179, p = 1.3 × 10−9, odds ratio = 0.86).
for redirecting t‐lymphocytes to induce prostate cancer cell lysis, we constructed a novel bispecific single‐chain (bsc) diabody directed to the prostate specific membrane antigen (psma) and the t‐cell receptor (tcr)‐associated cd3 molecule on t‐cells. to target nk cells against non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, we constructed a bispecific diabody (bsdb) with reactivity against both human cd19 and fcγriii (cd16). bacterially produced cd19 × cd16 bsdb specifically interacted with both cd19+ and cd16+ cells and exhibited significantly higher apparent affinity and slower dissociation from the tumor cells than from effector cells. it was able to induce specific lysis of tumor cells in the presence of isolated human nk cells or nonfractionated pbls. the combination of the cd19 × cd16 bsdb with a previously described cd19 × cd3 bsdb and cd28 costimulation significantly increased the lytic potential of human pbls. treatment of scid mice bearing an established burkitt’s lymphoma (5 mm in diameter) with human pbls, cd19 × cd16 bsdb, cd19 × cd3 bsdb, and anti-cd28 mab resulted in the complete elimination of tumors in 80% of animals. in contrast, mice receiving human pbls in combination with either diabody alone showed only partial tumor regression. these data clearly demonstrate the synergistic effect of small recombinant bispecific molecules recruiting different populations of human effector cells to the same tumor target.
a.m. domanski, n. monsef, h.a. domanski, d. grabau and m. fernö comparison of the oestrogen and progesterone receptor status in primary breast carcinomas as evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry: a consecutive series of 267 patients this study was undertaken to assess the potential value of thinprep-processed (cytyc, boxborough, ma) smears from malignant breast fine-needle aspirates (fnas) for the determination of estrogen receptor (er) and progesterone receptor (pr) status. the er and pr content of 142 malignant fnas were compared with the results of the surgically excised tumors in which the assay was done by enzyme immunoassay in 97 cases or by immunohistochemistry in 45 cases. monoclonal antibodies directed against er-1d5 (dako, carpinteria, ca) and pr-1a6 (dako) were used with the antigen retrieval technique. by using enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemistry as standards, the overall accuracy for er was 97% and for pr was 89%. the results of this study show that the thinprep smear with microwave antigen retrieval pretreatment is a reliable method and a suitable alternative for hormone receptor analysis in breast carcinoma.
we have recently shown that spinal calmodulin inhibitors (w-7 and calmidazolium) dose-dependently inhibit the nociceptive reaction (biting, scratching, licking, bsl) evoked by intrathecal n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) and septide, an agonist of the neurokinin (nk) nk1 receptor. to compare this effect with that induced by standard analgesics, we now report a study of the effects of calmidazolium (14–420 nmol), bupivacaine (29–582 nmol) and morphine (26–260 nmol) when coadministered intrathecally with either nmda (4 µg) or septide (0.5 µg). calmidazolium had the highest potency for inhibiting septide-induced nociceptive behaviour, acting over a dose range of 34–130 nmol (dose eliciting a half-maximal response, ed50, 67 nmol) lower than that of bupivacaine [ed50 234 (115–475) nmol]. only the highest dose of morphine (260 nmol) inhibited septide-evoked bsl [ed50=133 (69–255) nmol]. higher doses of morphine could not be tested due to the appearance of an excitatory aversive reaction. both calmidazolium [ed50=232 (138–388) nmol] and bupivacaine [ed50=123 (59–256) nmol] dose-dependently reduced nmda-induced bsl reaching an almost maximal inhibition at the highest doses assayed (420 and 291 nmol, respectively). in contrast, morphine had less effect on nmda-induced behaviour, inducing only a partial reduction of bsl even with the highest dose assayed (260 nmol). overall, it can be concluded that the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium inhibits septide- and nmda-evoked nociceptive behaviour with a potency and efficacy at least as high as those of morphine and bupivacaine. intrathecal injection of substance p produced a behavioural syndrome, consisting of reciproacal hindlimb scratching and biting or fore- and hind-licking. pretreatment with either an analogue of substance p, (d-pro2, d-trp7,9)-substance p (dpdt-sp) or (d-arg1, d-pro2,4, d-trp7,9, leu11)-substance p, given intrathecally, reduced the response to substance p in a dose-dependent manner. the behaviour induced by substance p was also inhibited by intrathecal, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of morphine. intrathecal or subcutaneous injection of naloxone showed a biphasic effect on substance p response; the substance p-induced nociceptive response was increased by a small dose of naloxone, while it was inversely decreased by a large dose of naloxone. the results with analogues of substance p support the hypothesis that substance p, injected intrathecally, acts directly on substance p receptors in the spinal cord. the nociceptive response induced by substance p appears to be controlled by endogenous opioids in the spinal cord.
physalis peruviana, commonly known as cape gooseberry, is an andean solanaceae fruit with high nutritional value and interesting medicinal properties. in the present study we report the development and characterization of microsatellite loci from a p. peruviana commercial colombian genotype. we identified 932 imperfect and 201 perfect simple sequence repeats (ssr) loci in untranslated regions (utrs) and 304 imperfect and 83 perfect ssr loci in coding regions from the assembled physalis peruviana leaf transcriptome. the utr ssr loci were used for the development of 162 primers for amplification. the efficiency of these primers was tested via pcr in a panel of seven p. peruviana accessions including colombia, kenya and ecuador ecotypes and one closely related species physalis floridana. we obtained an amplification rate of 83% and a polymorphic rate of 22%. here we report the first p. peruviana specific microsatellite set, a valuable tool for a wide variety of applications, including functional diversity, conservation and improvement of the species. a computer‐based analysis was conducted to assess the characteristics of microsatellites in transcribed regions of rice and arabidopsis. in addition, two mammals were simultaneously analyzed for a comparative analysis. our analyses confirmed a novel plant‐specific feature in which there is a gradient in microsatellite density along the direction of transcription. it was also confirmed that pyrimidine‐rich microsatellites are found intensively near the transcription start sites, specifically in the two plants, but not in the mammals. our results suggest that microsatellites located at high frequency in the 5′‐flanking regions of plant genes can potentially act as factors in regulating gene expression.
in healthy people, a preference in attention maintenance and memory for words with emotional valence comparing to neutral words has been shown. the pattern of emotional stimuli processing may be different in people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mtle) and it may be sensitive to the presence of depressive symptoms. in order to explore these possibilities, we applied the emotional spatial cueing attentional task and the free recall memory task to participants (n=39) with mtle and compared them with healthy controls. we hypothesized that the pattern of maintaining attention and remembering emotional words is different in people with mtle. current literature indicates that this pattern will change from positive bias in the controls, though no emotional bias in the participants with mtle without depression (mtle-d), and in this work we examined this pattern in the participants with mtle with depressive symptoms (mtle+d). our results show that in both attention and memory, control subjects exhibit positive emotional bias, the subjects with mtle-d show nonemotional bias and the subjects with mtle+d have bias away from positive words. participants with mtle+d maintained attention for positive words shorter than others. participants with mtle+d had worse recall for positive words than the participants with mtle-d and for all words when compared to controls. we found that faster attention disengagement from positive words and worse memory for positive words is associated with elevated levels of depressive symptoms. background excessive chronic drinking is accompanied by a broad spectrum of emotional changes ranging from apathy and emotional flatness to deficits in comprehending emotional information, but their neural bases are poorly understood.   methods emotional abnormalities associated with alcoholism were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging in abstinent long-term alcoholic men in comparison to healthy demographically matched controls. participants were presented with emotionally valenced words and photographs of faces during deep (semantic) and shallow (perceptual) encoding tasks followed by recognition.   results overall, faces evoked stronger activation than words, with the expected material-specific laterality (left hemisphere for words, and right for faces) and depth of processing effects. however, whereas control participants showed stronger activation in the amygdala and hippocampus when viewing faces with emotional (relative to neutral) expressions, the alcoholics responded in an undifferentiated manner to all facial expressions. in the alcoholic participants, amygdala activity was inversely correlated with an increase in lateral prefrontal activity as a function of their behavioral deficits. prefrontal modulation of emotional function as a compensation for the blunted amygdala activity during a socially relevant face appraisal task is in agreement with a distributed network engagement during emotional face processing.   conclusions deficient activation of amygdala and hippocampus may underlie impaired processing of emotional faces associated with long-term alcoholism and may be a part of the wide array of behavioral problems including disinhibition, concurring with previously documented interpersonal difficulties in this population. furthermore, the results suggest that alcoholics may rely on prefrontal rather than temporal limbic areas in order to compensate for reduced limbic responsivity and to maintain behavioral adequacy when faced with emotionally or socially challenging situations.
biodiversity studies are commonly conducted using 18s rrna genes. in this study, we compared the inter-species divergence of variable regions (v1–9) within the copepod 18s rrna gene, and tested their taxonomic resolutions at different taxonomic levels. our results indicate that the 18s rrna gene is a good molecular marker for the study of copepod biodiversity, and our conclusions are as follows: 1) 18s rrna genes are highly conserved intra-species (intra-species similarities are close to 100%); and could aid in species-level analyses, but with some limitations; 2) nearly-whole-length sequences and some partial regions (around v2, v4, and v9) of the 18s rrna gene can be used to discriminate between samples at both the family and order levels (with a success rate of about 80%); 3) compared with other regions, v9 has a higher resolution at the genus level (with an identification success rate of about 80%); and 4) v7 is most divergent in length, and would be a good candidate marker for the phylogenetic study of acartia species. this study also evaluated the correlation between similarity thresholds and the accuracy of using nuclear 18s rrna genes for the classification of organisms in the subclass copepoda. we suggest that sample identification accuracy should be considered when a molecular sequence divergence threshold is used for taxonomic identification, and that the lowest similarity threshold should be determined based on a pre-designated level of acceptable accuracy. molecular tools have revolutionized the exploration of biodiversity, especially in organisms for which traditional taxonomy is difficult, such as for microscopic animals (meiofauna). environmental (edna) metabarcode surveys of dna extracted from sediment samples are increasingly popular for surveying biodiversity. most edna surveys use the nuclear gene-encoding small-subunit rdna gene (18s) as a marker; however, different markers and metrics used for delimiting species have not yet been evaluated against each other or against morphologically defined species (morphospecies). we assessed more than 12,000 meiofaunal sequences of 18s and of the main alternatively used marker [cytochrome c oxidase subunit i (coi) mtdna] belonging to 55 datasets covering three taxonomic ranks. our results show that 18s reduced diversity estimates by a factor of 0.4 relative to morphospecies, whereas coi increased diversity estimates by a factor of 7.6. moreover, estimates of species richness using coi were robust among three of four commonly used delimitation metrics, whereas estimates using 18s varied widely with the different metrics. we show that meiofaunal diversity has been greatly underestimated by 18s edna surveys and that the use of coi provides a better estimate of diversity. the suitability of coi is supported by cross-mating experiments in the literature and evolutionary analyses of discreteness in patterns of genetic variation. furthermore its splitting of morphospecies is expected from documented levels of cryptic taxa in exemplar meiofauna. we recommend against using 18s as a marker for biodiversity surveys and suggest that use of coi for edna surveys could provide more accurate estimates of species richness in the future.
regular physical exercise is recognized as a nonpharmacological therapeutic strategy in the treatment of metabolic syndrome, and has been proposed for improving obesity, diabetic status, insulin resistance, and immune response. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a regular exercise program (treadmill running, 5 days/week for 14 weeks at 35 cm/s for 35 min in the last month) on the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (ifnγ) by peritoneal cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) from obese zucker rats (fa/fa) in response to noradrenaline (na) and heat shock proteins of 72 kda (hsp72), and the possible adaptation due to training for a bout acute exercise (a single session of 25–35 min at 35 cm/s). in healthy (lean fa/fa) and obese animals, peritoneal cells released greater concentrations of ifnγ in response to hsp72 and lower concentrations in response to na. the regular exercise training protocol, evaluated in the obese animals, produced a clear change in the regulation of the release of ifnγ. peritoneal immune cells from trained animals released more ifnγ in response to na, but there was a reduction in the release of ifnγ in response to hsp72. in the obese animals, regular exercise caused a change in the inhibitory effect of na (which now becomes stimulatory) and the stimulatory effect of hsp72e (which now becomes inhibitory) in relation to the release of ifnγ. this reflects that hsp72, induced by the prior release of na following exercise-induced stress, plays a role in the homeostatic balance of release of ifnγ by peritoneal immune cells in obese animals during exercise. backgroundmetabolic syndrome (ms) is a metabolic disorder associated with obesity, type-ii diabetes, and "low grade inflammation", with the concomitant increased risk of cardiovascular events. removal of the inflammatory mediator signals is a promising strategy to protect against insulin resistance, obesity, and other problems associated with ms such as cardiovascular disease. the aim of the present investigation was to determine the "inflammatory and stress status" in an experimental model of ms, and to evaluate the effect of a program of habitual exercise and the resulting training-induced adaptation to the effects of a single bout of acute exercise.methodsobese zucker rats (fa/fa) were used as the experimental model of ms, and lean zucker rats (fa/fa) were used for reference values. the habitual exercise (performed by the obese rats) consisted of treadmill running: 5 days/week for 14 weeks, at 35 cm/s for 35 min in the last month. the acute exercise consisted of a single session of 25-35 min at 35 cm/s. circulating concentrations of il-6 (a cytokine that regulates the inflammatory and metabolic responses), crp (a systemic inflammatory marker), and corticosterone (ctc) (the main glucocorticoid in rats) were determined by elisa, and that of noradrenaline (na) was determined by hplc. glucose was determined by standard methods.resultsthe genetically obese animals showed higher circulating levels of glucose, il-6, pcr, and na compared with the control lean animals. the habitual exercise program increased the concentration of il-6, pcr, na, and glucose, but decreased that of ctc. acute exercise increased il-6, crp, and na in the sedentary obese animals, but not in the trained obese animals. ctc was increased after the acute exercise in the trained animals only.conclusionanimals with ms present a dysregulation in the feedback mechanism between il-6 and na which can contribute to the systemic low-grade inflammation and/or hyperglycaemia of ms. an inappropriate exercise intensity can worsen this dysregulation, contributing to the metabolic, inflammatory, and stress disorders associated with ms. habitual exercise (i.e., training) induces a positive adaptation in the response to acute exercise.
the corticospinal tract is a predominantly crossed pathway. nevertheless, the primary motor cortex (m1) is activated bilaterally during unilateral movements and several animal studies showed that m1 has a bilateral motor representation. a better understanding of the uncrossed corticospinal system is especially important for elucidating its role in recovery of limb control after unilateral injury. we used intracortical microstimulation (icms) to determine the representation of contralateral and ipsilateral forelimb joints at single m1 sites in the rat. most sites representing an ipsilateral joint corepresented the same joint contralaterally. we next determined whether ipsilateral responses evoked in one hemisphere depended on the function of m1 in the opposite hemisphere using reversible inactivation and pyramidal tract lesion. ipsilateral responses were eliminated when the homotopic forelimb area of m1 in the opposite hemisphere was inactivated or when the pyramidal tract on the nonstimulated side was sectioned. to determine the role of transfer between m1 in each hemisphere we sectioned the corpus callosum, which produced a 33% increase in ipsilateral icms thresholds. neither m1 inactivation nor callosal section changed contralateral response thresholds, indicating the absence of tonic excitatory or inhibitory drive to the opposite m1. finally, ipsilateral responses following m1 inactivation and pyramidal tract lesion could be evoked after systemic administration of the k+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine, suggesting the presence of latent connections. our findings show important interactions between the corticospinal systems from each side, especially at the spinal level. this has important implications for recruiting the ipsilateral corticospinal system after injury. in conclusion, the rat primary motor cortex appears to be organized into irregularly shaped patches of cortex devoted to particular movements. the location of major subdivisions such as the forelimb or hindlimb areas is somatotopic and is consistent from animal to animal, but the internal organization of the pattern of movements represented within major subdivisions varies significantly between animals. the motor cortex includes both agranular primary motor cortex (agl) and, in addition, a significant amount of the bordering granular somatic sensory cortex (gr(si)), as well as the rostral portion of the taste sensory insular or claustrocortex (cl). the rat frontal cortex also contains a second, rostral motor representation of the forelimb, trunk and hindlimb, which is somatotopically organized and may be the rat's supplementary motor area. both of these motor representations give rise to direct corticospinal projections, some of which may make monosynaptic connections with cervical enlargement motoneurons. medial to the primary motor cortex, in cytoarchitectonic field agm, is what appears to be part of the rat's frontal eye fields, a region which also includes the vibrissae motor representation. the somatic motor cortical output organization pattern in the rat is remarkably similar to that seen in the primate, whose primary, supplementary and frontal eye field cortical motor regions have been extensively studied.
investigations of working memory capacity in the visual domain have converged on the concept of a limited supply of a representational medium, flexibly distributed between objects. current debate centers on whether this medium is continuous, or quantized into 2 or 3 memory “slots”. the latter model makes the strong prediction that, if an item in memory is probed, behavioral parameters will plateau when the number of items is the same or more than the number of slots. here we examine short-term memory for object location using a two-dimensional pointing task. we show that recall variability for items in memory increases monotonically from 1 to 8 items. using a novel method to isolate only those trials on which a participant correctly identifies the target, we show that response latency also increases monotonically from 1 to 8 items. we argue that both these findings are incompatible with a quantized model. the process of encoding a visual scene into working memory has previously been studied using binary measures of recall. here, we examine the temporal evolution of memory resolution, based on observers' ability to reproduce the orientations of objects presented in brief, masked displays. recall precision was accurately described by the interaction of two independent constraints: an encoding limit that determines the maximum rate at which information can be transferred into memory and a separate storage limit that determines the maximum fidelity with which information can be maintained. recall variability decreased incrementally with time, consistent with a parallel encoding process in which visual information from multiple objects accumulates simultaneously in working memory. no evidence was observed for a limit on the number of items stored. cuing one display item with a brief flash led to rapid development of a recall advantage for that item. this advantage was short-lived if the cue was simply a salient visual event but was maintained if it indicated an object of particular relevance to the task. these cuing effects were observed even for items that had already been encoded into memory, indicating that limited memory resources can be rapidly reallocated to prioritize salient or goal-relevant information.
the present study investigated whether enrichment of the pig maternal diet with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) affects the fatty-acid composition of female piglets via enhancing of expression of the lipogenic enzymes δ5-desaturase (δ5d) and δ6-desaturase (δ6d). the sows (50% landrace × 50% large white) were fed a control diet or one of the experimental diets starting at day 45 in gestation. the experimental diets were supplemented either with linseed oil or fish oil, whereas the control diet contained palm oil. expression of δ5d and δ6d, and fatty-acid composition was determined by western blotting and gas-liquid chromatography, respectively, in muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver. the highest δ5d protein expression was observed in the piglets' muscle, followed by subcutaneous adipose tissue, with the lowest level in the liver. expression of δ6d in the piglets' tissues followed an opposite pattern, and was highest in the liver, followed by subcutaneous adipose tissue, with the lowest level in muscle. supplementation of the maternal diet with fish oil or linseed oil increased the level of n-3 pufa of the piglets in a tissue-specific manner. the response of δ6d and δ5d protein expression in female piglets, with average birth weight 2.4 kg, to the dietary manipulation was also tissue-specific. it is suggested that the increase in n-3 pufa content in the progeny was related, at least partially, to the activation of δ6d and δ5d expression. the purpose of the present study was to compare the influence of adding no or 8% fat of varying sources (coconut oil, fish oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil) to diets for sows 1 week prior to farrowing and during lactation on the composition of fatty acids in plasma and tissues of the progeny while sucking and 3 weeks after weaning from the sow. a control diet without supplemental fat and four diets supplemented with 8% of coconut oil, rapeseed oil, fish oil or sunflower oil were provided to lactating sows (n = 15), and during the post-weaning period the same weaner diet was provided to all piglets (n = 15 litters), which were housed litterwise. the dietary ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids of the maternal diets largely influenced the progeny, as the ratio varying from 1.2 (fish oil) to 12.2 (sunflower oil) in the sow milk was reflected in plasma and adipose tissues of the sucking progeny. the liver showed similar variations according to dietary treatments, but a lower n-6:n-3 fatty acids ratio. from day 4 to later on during the suckling period, the concentration of c14:0, c16:0 and c18:1 in the liver of the piglets decreased, irrespective of the dietary treatments of sows. in plasma and liver, the total concentration of saturated fatty acids (safa), monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) did not differ markedly in piglets sucking sows fed different dietary fatty acids, whereas the adipose tissue of piglets sucking sows fed sunflower oil and coconut oil showed the highest proportion of pufa and safa, respectively. weaning lowered the concentration of lipid-soluble extracts in plasma and the concentration of fatty acids in the liver of the piglets. within the post-weaning period, dietary treatments of sows, rather than age of piglets, influenced the fatty acid composition of plasma and adipose tissue of the piglets, whereas the hepatic fatty acid profile was more affected by the age of the piglets during the post-weaning period. this study shows that the fatty acid profile of plasma and tissues of the progeny is highly dependent on the maternal dietary composition, and that the dietary impact persists for up to 3 weeks after the suckling period.
the emergence of the pandemic strain vibrio parahaemolyticus o3:k6 in 1996 caused a large increase of diarrhea outbreaks related to seafood consumption in southeast asia, and later worldwide. isolates of this strain constitutes a clonal complex, and their effectual differentiation is possible by comparison of their variable number tandem repeats (vntrs). the differentiation of the isolates by the differences in vntrs will allow inferring the population dynamics and microevolution of this strain but this requires knowing the rate and mechanism of vntrs' variation. our study of mutants obtained after serial cultivation of clones showed that mutation rates of the six vntrs examined are on the order of 10−4 mutant per generation and that difference increases by stepwise addition of single mutations. the single stepwise mutation (ssm) was deduced because mutants with 1, 2, 3, or more repeat unit deletions or insertions follow a geometric distribution. plausible phylogenetic trees are obtained when, according to ssm, the genetic distance between clusters with different number of repeats is assessed by the absolute differences in repeats. using this approach, mutants originated from different isolates of pandemic v. parahaemolyticus after serial cultivation are clustered with their parental isolates. additionally, isolates of pandemic v. parahaemolyticus from southeast asia, tokyo, and northern and southern chile are clustered according their geographical origin. the deepest split in these four populations is observed between the tokyo and southern chile populations. we conclude that proper phylogenetic relations and successful tracing of pandemic v. parahaemolyticus requires measuring the differences between isolates by the absolute number of repeats in the vntrs considered. we identified seven distinct subtypes of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 isolates that were derived from sporadic cases and outbreaks from multiple prefectures in japan in 2005. a surveillance system utilizing pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), pulsenet japan, was used. some strains showed indistinguishable pfge patterns using another restriction enzyme (blni or spei) in each subtype of ehec o157:h7 isolates that were routinely subtyped by the xbai pfge pattern. in order to examine the genotypic relatedness of these strains, we carried out a multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (vntr) analysis (mlva). by using the mlva system, we found that three of seven subtypes of ehec o157:h7 strains that were isolated from sporadic cases dispersed across multiple prefectures within a few months showed indistinguishable pfge patterns and identical mlva types. strains belonging to the other four subtypes of ehec o157:h7 in the pfge analysis were further classified into different clusters of ehec o157:h7. therefore, compared to pfge, mlva showed greater discriminatory power with respect to analysis of the isolates in this study.
giardia intestinalis is a common gastrointestinal protozoan worldwide, but its effects on childhood growth in developing countries are not clearly understood. the authors aimed to describe its effects on child growth. they followed 220 peruvian children daily for diarrhea, weekly for stool samples, and monthly for anthropometry. the authors modeled the effect of nutritional status on the risk of giardia infection and the risk of diarrhea attributable to giardia using negative binomial regression. they modeled the effects of giardia infection on growth using linear regression, with 85% of children becoming infected with giardia and 87% of these becoming reinfected. in multivariable analysis, the risk of giardia infection did not vary with weight for age (relative risk = 1.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.89, 1.12) or height for age (relative risk = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 1.04). giardiasis did not affect growth at 1 or 2 months following the first infection at any age interval. the longitudinal prevalence of giardia between 6 and 24 months of age was not associated with height gain in that interval (p = 0.981). giardia was not associated with an increased risk of diarrhea at any age interval. study results question the importance of giardia as a childhood pathogen in developing countries where giardiasis is hyperendemic. in a peri-urban shanty town in lima, peru, that was hyperendemic for giardia lamblia, 44 children aged between 0.9 months and 10 years were effectively treated for giardia lamblia with tinidazole. stools were examined weekly in the 6 months after treatment to determine the rate of reinfection, and after reinfection stools continued to be examined. 98% of the children became reinfected with giardia lamblia within 6 months, and after reinfection stool excretion of the parasite lasted a mean (sd) of 3.2 (3.3) months. the children's mean stool ph and their mean stool fat index was unaffected by giardia lamblia reinfection. treatment of all symptomless giardia lamblia infections in a developing country hyperendemic for the disease is of questionable value because of rapid reinfection.
mammalian ran-binding protein-1 (ranbp1) and its fission yeast homologue, sbp1p, are cytosolic proteins that interact with the gtp-charged form of ran gtpase through a conserved ran-binding domain (rbd). in vitro, this interaction can accelerate the ran gtpase-activating protein-mediated hydrolysis of gtp on ran and the turnover of nuclear import and export complexes. to analyze ranbp1 function in vivo, we expressed exogenous ranbp1, sbp1p, and the rbd of each in mammalian cells, in wild-type fission yeast, and in yeast whose endogenous sbp1 gene was disrupted. mammalian cells and wild-type yeast expressing moderate levels of each protein were viable and displayed normal nuclear protein import. sbp1(-) yeast were inviable but could be rescued by all four exogenous proteins. two rbds of the mammalian nucleoporin ranbp2 also rescued sbp1(-) yeast. in mammalian cells, wild-type yeast, and rescued mutant yeast, exogenous full-length ranbp1 and sbp1p localized predominantly to the cytosol, whereas exogenous rbds localized predominantly to the cell nucleus. these results suggest that only the rbd of sbp1p is required for its function in fission yeast, and that this function may not require confinement of the rbd to the cytosol. the results also indicate that the polar amino-terminal portion of sbp1p mediates cytosolic localization of the protein in both yeast and mammalian cells. the murine htf9-a/ranbp1 and htf9-c genes are divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. the htf9-a gene encodes the ranbp1 protein, a major partner of the ran gtpase. the divergently transcribed htf9-c gene encodes a protein sharing similarity with yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes. we report here that both mrna species produced by the htf9-associated genes are regulated during the cell cycle progression, peak in s phase and decrease during mitosis. transient expression experiments with reporter constructs showed that cell cycle expression is controlled at the transcriptional level, because the bidirectional htf9 promoter is down-regulated in growth-arrested cells, is activated at the g1/s transition and reaches maximal activity in s phase, though with a different efficiency for each orientation. we have delimited specific promoter regions controlling s phase activity in one or both orientations: identified elements contain recognition sites for members belonging to both the e2f and sp1 families of transcription factors. together, the results suggest that the sharing of the regulatory region supports co-regulation of the htf9-a/ranbp1 and htf9-c genes in a common window of the cell cycle.
previous research on motor sequence learning (msl) in the elderly has focused mainly on unilateral tasks, even though bilateral coordination might be impaired in this age group. in this fmri study, 28 right-handed elderly subjects were recruited. the paradigm consisted of a novel and a simple control sequence executed with the right (r), left (l) and both hands (b). behavioral performance (accuracy[ac], inter-tap interval[iti]) and associated brain activity were assessed during early learning. behavioral performance in the novel task was similar between unilateral conditions whereas in the bimanual condition more errors and slower motor execution were observed. brain activity increases during learning showed differences between conditions: r showed increased activity in pre-sma, basal ganglia and left hippocampus while b showed activity increments mainly in posterior parietal cortex and cerebellum. l did not show any activity modulation during learning. performance correlates for ac (related to spatial success) and iti (related to accurate timing) shared a cortico-basal-cerebellar network. however, it was found that the iti regressor presented additional significant correlations with activity in sma and basal ganglia in r. the ac regressor showed additional significant correlations with activity in more extended thalamic and cerebellar areas in b. the present findings suggest that, behaviorally, the spatial and temporal components of msl are impaired in elderly subjects when using both hands. additionally, differential brain activity patterns were found across hand modalities. the results obtained reveal the existence of a highly specialized network in the dominant hand and identify areas specifically involved in bimanual coordination. neural networks of motor control are well understood and the motor domain therefore lends itself to the study of learning. neuroimaging of motor learning has demonstrated fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar involvement. however, there is conflicting evidence on the specific functional contributions of individual regions and their relative importance for early and advanced stages of learning. using functional mri (fmri), we examined hemodynamic effects in seven right-handed men during brief episodes of explicit learning of novel six-digit sequences (experiments 1 and 2) and during prolonged learning of an eight-digit sequence (experiment 3), all performed with the dominant hand. brief episodes of new learning were predominantly associated with bilateral activations in premotor and supplementary motor areas, superior and inferior parietal cortices, and anterior cerebellum. in experiment 2, which included a control condition matched for complexity of motor execution, we also found unexpectedly strong activation in the bilateral inferior frontal lobes. in experiment 3, analysis of task by learning stage interactions showed greater involvement of the bilateral superior parietal lobes, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left caudate nucleus during early stages, whereas left occipito-temporal and superior frontal cortex as well as the bilateral parahippocampal region were more activated during late learning stages. analysis of task by performance interactions (based on each subject's response times and accuracy during each scan) showed effects in bilateral fronto-polar, right hippocampal, and anterior cerebellar regions associated with high levels of performance, as well as inverse effects in bilateral occipito-parietal regions. we conclude that superior parietal and occipital regions are most intensely involved in visually driven explicit digit sequence learning during early stages and low performance, whereas later stages of acquisition and higher levels of performance are characterized by stronger recruitment of prefrontal and mediotemporal regions.
loss of integrin-mediated cell adhesion is known to induce internalization of lipid rafts, which alters of the plasma membrane's physical and signaling properties. analysis of multiple proteins now shows a wide range of behaviors in which internalization and exit from the ordered to disordered domains are regulated separately. lipid rafts and caveolae are specialized membrane microdomains implicated in regulating g protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. previous studies have suggested that rafts/caveolae may regulate β-adrenergic receptor/gαs signaling, but underlying molecular mechanisms are largely undefined. using a simplified model system in c6 glioma cells, this study disrupts rafts/caveolae using both pharmacological and genetic approaches to test whether caveolin-1 and lipid microdomains regulate gs trafficking and signaling. lipid rafts/caveolae were disrupted in c6 cells by either short-term cholesterol chelation using methyl-β-cyclodextrin or by stable knockdown of caveolin-1 and -2 by rna interference. in imaging studies examining gαs-gfp during signaling, stimulation with the βar agonist isoproterenol resulted in internalization of gαs-gfp; however, this trafficking was blocked by methyl-β-cyclodextrin or by caveolin knockdown. caveolin knockdown significantly decreased gαs localization in detergent insoluble lipid raft/caveolae membrane fractions, suggesting that caveolin localizes a portion of gαs to these membrane microdomains. methyl-β-cyclodextrin or caveolin knockdown significantly increased isoproterenol or thyrotropin-stimulated camp accumulation. furthermore, forskolin- and aluminum tetrafluoride-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly increased by caveolin knockdown in cells or in brain membranes obtained from caveolin-1 knockout mice, indicating that caveolin attenuates signaling at the level of gαs/adenylyl cyclase and distal to gpcrs. taken together, these results demonstrate that caveolin-1 and lipid microdomains exert a major effect on gαs trafficking and signaling. it is suggested that lipid rafts/caveolae are sites that remove gαs from membrane signaling cascades and caveolins might dampen globally gαs/adenylyl cyclase/camp signaling.
we present a field application of a new in situ technique to analyze phase transformations of fine lead oxide particles (50-100mum) in different soils directly in the field over 18 months. after the first month of exposure to a calcareous sand we found newly precipitated secondary mineral phases on the lead oxide. the samples exposed to two loamy soils (dystric cambisol and luvisol) showed only very few traces of new phases. we identified the new phases as mainly lead-hydroxy carbonates (hydrocerussite). whereas the results confirm the transformation of lead phases to lead carbonates in calcareous soil, they also show that an easily soluble phase such as pbo may persist in soils virtually unweathered for more than one year. the formation of a weathering crust is therefore not necessarily needed for preservation of easily soluble phases. the use of experimental in situ methods is thus giving new information on contaminant mineral behavior under field conditions. contamination of shooting range soils from the use of pb bullets is under increasing scrutiny. past research on pb contamination of shooting ranges has focused on weathering reactions of pb bullets in soil. the objective of this study was to determine the significance of abrasion of pb bullets in contributing to soil pb contamination. this was accomplished by firing a known mass of bullets into sand and analyzing for total pb after removing bullets, through field sampling of a newly opened shooting range, and a laboratory weathering study. forty-one mg of pb were abraded per bullet as it passed through the sand, which accounted for 1.5% of the bullet mass being physically removed. at a shooting range that had been open for 3 months, the highest pb concentration from the pistol range berm soil was 193 mg/kg at 0.5 m height, and from the rifle range berm soil was 1142 mg/kg at 1.0 m height. most soils from the field abrasion experiment as well as soil collected from the rifle range had splp-pb >15 microg/l (synthetic precipitation leaching procedure). typically, pb concentration in the rifle range was greater than that of the pistol range. based on a laboratory weathering study, virtually all metallic pb was converted to hydrocerussite (pb3(co3)2(oh)2), as well as to a lesser extent cerussite (pbco3) and massicot (pbo) within one week. our study demonstrated that abrasion of lead bullets and their subsequent weathering can be a significant source of lead contamination in soils of a newly opened shooting range.
introduction and hypothesisalthough there is no consensus on the management of persistent or recurrent stress urinary incontinence (sui) after placement of a midurethral synthetic sling (mus), a repeat mus procedure is commonly performed with favorable results. the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a repeat mus procedure compared to the primary procedure in women with sui, and to investigate factors associated with the failure of the repeat procedure.methodswe retrospectively analyzed data from 53 women who underwent a repeat mus procedure and 102 women who underwent a primary mus procedure at a single center. success was defined as no urine leakage during physical activity based on the sandvik questionnaire. outcomes were assessed using the sandvik severity index and incontinence-quality of life (i-qol) questionnaire. multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors predicting failure of the repeat procedure.resultsthe success rate was 76.5 % for the primary mus procedure (78/102 patients) and 69.8 % for the repeat mus procedure (37/53 patients; p = 0.369). the mean follow-up duration was significantly longer for the primary procedure (83.8 months vs. 54.6 months, p < 0.001). sui and all domain scores of the i-qol were significantly better following the repeat mus procedure than following the primary procedure. in the multivariate analysis, sui grade 3 was the only independent factor predicting failure of the repeat qq (odds ratio 7.610, p = 0.023).conclusionsa repeat mus procedure after a failed primary mus procedure was shown to be effective. however, a repeat procedure may be unsuccessful in patients with grade 3 sui. background data about the use of tension-free vaginal tape (tvt) in the management of recurrent urodynamic stress incontinence (rusi) after previous failed midurethral sling procedure (musp) are limited.   objective assessment of the efficacy and the indications of the tvt procedure in the management of patients with rusi after failed previous musp.   design, setting, and participants thirty-one patients with rusi after previous failed musp were prospectively enrolled at a single tertiary academic center.   measurements preoperatively and postoperatively, patients were assessed with physical examination, urinalysis, urine culture, bladder diary for 2-3 d, q-tip test, uroflow, filling and voiding cystometry, urethral profilometry, and 1-h pad test. mean follow-up was at 18.6 mo (range: 12-28 mo).   results and limitations overall, the objective cure rate based on the pad test findings was 74%, the improvement rate was 6.5%, and the failure rate was 19.5%. the objective cure rate based on cough stress test during filling cystometry was 77.4%, and the subjective cure rate based on patients' answers was 71%. the study could have some limitations. the relatively small number of patients enrolled could affect the findings of study to some degree. additionally, because urethral pressure profiles show a significant degree of directional dependence when side-hole microtip transducers are used, as in the present study, the orientation of the transducer could affect the values measured.   conclusions the tvt procedure as a second operation could provide an overall cure rate of 74% with a low complication rate in female patients with rusi after previous failed midurethral tape procedures.
investigating the health status of agricultural workers is a challenging goal. contradictory outcomes concerning farmers’ health are reported in the literature. in this cross-sectional study, certain clinical and neurobehavioral health outcomes were compared between farmers and non-farmers living in the same rural area. farmers (328) and non-farmers (347), matched per age and sex, were selected randomly in an agricultural area in west greece. both groups underwent haematological and biochemical examinations and were administered two neurobehavioral tests, namely the mini-mental state examination (mmse) and the montgomery-åsberg depression rating scale (madrs). sociodemographic, personal medical, nutritional and lifestyle data were recorded. according to personal statements, farmers suffered from hypertension, cardiovascular, orthopaedic and ent problems in higher frequency. haematocrit, haemoglobin and serum cholinesterase’s activity were found to be lower among farmers. lower prevalence of hypertension and better performances on mmse and madrs tests were recorded in young farmers in relation to young non-farmers, while these findings were reversed in older ages. odds ratios were calculated through multivariate logistic regression models. factors affecting these impairments remain to be clarified. comparing agricultural cohorts with the general population is challenging because the general healthiness of farmers may mask potential adverse health effects of farming. using data from the agricultural health study, a cohort of 89,656 pesticide applicators and their spouses (n = 89, 656) in north carolina and iowa, the authors computed standardized mortality ratios (smrs) comparing deaths from time of the enrollment (1993-1997) through 2007 to state-specific rates. to compensate for the cohort's overall healthiness, relative smrs were estimated by calculating the smr for each cause relative to the smr for all other causes. in 1,198,129 person-years of follow-up, 6,419 deaths were observed. the all-cause mortality rate was less than expected (smr(applicators) = 0.54, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.52, 0.55; smr(spouses) = 0.52, 95% ci: 0.50, 0.55). smrs for all cancers, heart disease, and diabetes were significantly below 1.0. in contrast, applicators experienced elevated numbers of machine-related deaths (smr = 4.15, 95% ci: 3.18, 5.31), motor vehicle nontraffic accidents (smr = 2.80, 95% ci: 1.81, 4.14), and collisions with objects (smr = 2.12, 95% ci: 1.25, 3.34). in the relative smr analysis for applicators, the relative mortality ratio was elevated for lymphohematopoietic cancers, melanoma, and digestive system, prostate, kidney, and brain cancers. among spouses, relative smrs exceeded 1.0 for lymphohematopoietic cancers and malignancies of the digestive system, brain, breast, and ovary. unintentional fatal injuries remain an important risk for farmers; mortality ratios from several cancers were elevated relative to other causes.
obstacles in elucidating the role of oxidative stress in aging include difficulties in (1) tracking in vivo oxidants, in (2) identifying affected proteins, and in (3) correlating changes in oxidant levels with life span. here, we used quantitative redox proteomics to determine the onset and the cellular targets of oxidative stress during caenorhabditis elegans' life span. in parallel, we used genetically encoded sensor proteins to determine peroxide levels in live animals in real time. we discovered that c. elegans encounters significant levels of oxidants as early as during larval development. oxidant levels drop rapidly as animals mature, and reducing conditions prevail throughout the reproductive age, after which age-accompanied protein oxidation sets in. long-lived daf-2 mutants transition faster to reducing conditions, whereas short-lived daf-16 mutants retain higher oxidant levels throughout their mature life. these results suggest that animals with improved capacity to recover from early oxidative stress have significant advantages later in life. to explore the role of mitochondrial activity in the aging process, we have lowered the activity of the electron transport chain and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (atp) synthase with rna interference (rnai) in caenorhabditis elegans. these perturbations reduced body size and behavioral rates and extended adult life-span. restoring messenger rna to near-normal levels during adulthood did not elevate atp levels and did not correct any of these phenotypes. conversely, inhibiting respiratory-chain components during adulthood only did not reset behavioral rates and did not affect life-span. thus, the developing animal appears to contain a regulatory system that monitors mitochondrial activity early in life and, in response, establishes rates of respiration, behavior, and aging that persist during adulthood.
rationalemost nicotine self-administration (nsa) studies in rats are performed under limited-access conditions. few studies have examined the relationship between nicotine dependence and nsa.objectivesto determine how nsa access conditions affect nsa and the duration of nicotine dependence during abstinence, as reflected in somatic signs of withdrawal precipitated by administration of the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine.methodsthe effects of different nsa access conditions (zero, 1 h/5 days, 1 h/7 days and 6 h/7 days per week) and non-contingent nicotine administration on nsa and somatic signs were examined.resultsdaily nsa access (30 days) resulted in spontaneous and mecamylamine-induced somatic signs. both daily access groups (1 h/day and 6 h/day, 7 days/week) exhibited spontaneous somatic signs on day 25 of nsa (17 h post-nsa) and sensitivity to mecamylamine up to 2 and 4 weeks of abstinence, respectively. in contrast, the 1 h/day, 5 days/week access group exhibited mecamylamine-induced somatic signs only up to 1 week of abstinence. nsa behavior was stable in rats with 1 h/day 5 days/week and 1 h/day 7 days/week access, but decreased from initially high rates in the 6 h/day 7 days/week access group, and decreased in rats receiving non-contingent nicotine. in contrast, extended cocaine self-administration access resulted in a gradual escalation in cocaine intake.conclusionthere was no escalation in nicotine intake with extended access conditions, unlike cocaine self-administration. nevertheless, daily nicotine self-administration seven days per week, for either 1 or 6 h per day, was sufficient to induce long-lasting adaptations in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity reflected in spontaneous and antagonist-precipitated somatic signs of withdrawal, possibly reflecting aspects of nicotine dependence. considering the importance of self-administration models in determining mechanisms of drug maintained behavior, we attempted to replicate the findings of nicotine self-administration by corrigall and coen. male, sprague-dawley rats, trained on food reinforcement, acquired relatively high and stable rates of self-administration of iv nicotine bitartrate (0.03 mg/kg, free base). extinction and reacquisition followed substituting saline and then nicotine, respectively. responses, infusions and intake decreased at 0.003 mg/kg, while intake increased at 0.06 mg/kg. this model of nicotine self-administration provides a reliable alternative to experimenter-administration models for examining the effects of nicotine.
backgroundmirnas play important roles in diverse biological processes including tumorigenesis. however, little is known about the function and mechanism of mir-451 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc).methodsquantitative rt-pcr was used to quantify mir-451 expression in npc cell lines and clinical tissues. kaplan-meier curves were used to estimate the association between mir-451 expression and survival. the mtt, colony formation, transwell migration and invasion assays, and a xenograft model were performed. a mir-451 target was confirmed using luciferase reporter assays, quantitative rt-pcr, and western blotting.resultsmir-451 was significantly downregulated in npc cell lines and clinical tissues (p < 0.01). patients with low expression of mir-451 had poorer overall survival (hr, 1.98; 95% ci, 1.16-3.34; p = 0.01) and disease-free survival (hr, 1.68; 95% ci, 1.07-2.62; p = 0.02) than patients with high expression. mir-451 was an independent prognostic factor in npc in multivariate cox regression analysis. ectopic expression of mir-451 suppressed cell viability, colony formation, and cell migration and invasion in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo. mif was verified as a direct target of mir-451, and mif regulated npc cell growth and invasion.conclusionsthe newly identified mir-451/mif pathway provides insight into npc initiation and progression, and may represent a novel therapeutic target. background: tumor microenvironments affect the progression of cancers. results: we demonstrated that th17 cells were accumulated in tumor tissues, and the tumor-derived mif induced th17 cell accumulation and had clinical relevance in npc. conclusion: the cytokine mif regulates intratumoral th17 cell expansion and has prognostic value for npc patients. significance: the tumor microenvironment influences the clinical prognosis of npc patients. the accumulation of an intratumoral cd4+ interleukin-17-producing subset (th17) of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils) is a general characteristic in many cancers. the relationship between the percentage of th17 cells and clinical prognosis differs among cancers. the mechanism responsible for the increasing percentage of such cells in npc is still unknown, as is their biological function. here, our data showed an increase of th17 cells in tumor tissues relative to their numbers in normal nasopharynx tissues or in the matched peripheral blood of npc patients. th17 cells in tumor tissue produced more ifnγ than did those in the peripheral blood of matched npc patients and healthy controls. we observed high levels of cd154, g-csf, cxcl1, il-6, il-8, and macrophage inhibitory factor (mif) out of 36 cytokines examined in tumor tissue cultures. mif promoted the generation and recruitment of th17 cells mediated by npc tumor cells in vitro; this promoting effect was mainly dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and was mediated by the mif-cxcr4 axis. finally, the expression level of mif in tumor cells and in tils was positively correlated in npc tumor tissues, and the frequency of mif-positive tils was positively correlated with npc patient clinical outcomes. taken together, our findings illustrate that tumor-derived mif can affect patient prognosis, which might be related to the increase of th17 cells in the npc tumor microenvironment.
el diagnostico de laboratorio de brucelosis es generalmente realizado por metodos microbiologicos y serologicos. la prueba pcr es reconocida como una alternativa especifica y sensible para la deteccion de diferentes agentes bacterianos. se realizo una evaluacion de la prueba pcr para la deteccion de adn de brucella melitensis en leche de oveja. ciento dos muestras tomadas de ovejas postaborto fueron analizadas por metodos de cultivo bacteriologico, prueba pcr y prueba del anillo en leche (mrt). el pcr detecto adn de b. melitensis en 24 (23,5%) de 102 muestras de leche, mientras que solamente 8 (7,8%) muestras de leche fueron positivas a b. melitensis por cultivo directo. el mrt detecto 28 (27,4%) muestras positivas de leche. el limite de deteccion de b. melitensis 16 m por pcr fue de 1,7x103-1,7x104 ufc/ml en leche inoculada. la concordancia entre pcr y mrt fue 96%. la sensibilidad diagnostica y la precision fueron determinadas como el 100% y el 81,3% respectivamente para la prueba de pcr y el 75% y el 75% para mrt. en conclusion, pcr es una herramienta muy util para el diagnostico rapido de b. melitensis en leche de oveja. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to diagnose goat brucellosis and compare its sensitivity against some of the most commonly used serological and bacteriological techniques. twenty two female and one male out of 300 clinically healthy, mixed-breed goats were randomly chosen from a ranch located at marín, nuevo león, mexico. milk and blood samples were taken from each animal and used to obtain both microbiological cultures and dna of the pathogen, and sera was tested against rose bengal antigen (rbt). results showed that 86% of the blood samples were positive on the pcr test, while 60% were positive on the serological test. the pathogen was isolated from only one blood culture. sixty four percent of the milk samples were positive on pcr tests, but failed to yield bacteria in culture. biochemical and pcr specific assay demonstrated that brucella abortus biovar 1 was associated with the infection. this study demonstrates the higher sensitivity of pcr over rbt and blood culture and its potential towards a rapid identification of brucella strains.
an interarm systolic blood pressure (sbp) difference of 10 mmhg or more have been associated with peripheral artery disease and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. we investigated whether an association exists between this difference and ankle-brachial index (abi), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (bapwv), and echocardiographic parameters. a total of 1120 patients were included in the study. the bilateral arm blood pressures were measured simultaneously by an abi-form device. the values of abi and bapwv were also obtained from the same device. clinical data, abi<0.9, bapwv, echocariographic parameters, and an interarm sbp difference ≥10 mmhg were compared and analyzed. we performed two multivariate forward analyses for determining the factors associated with an interarm sbp difference ≥10 mmhg [model 1: significant variables in univariate analysis except left ventricular mass index (lvmi); model 2: significant variables in univariate analysis except abi<0.9 and bapwv]. the abi<0.9 and high bapwv in model 1 and high lvmi in model 2 were independently associated with an interarm sbp difference ≥10 mmhg. female, hypertension, and high body mass index were also associated with an interarm sbp difference ≥10 mmhg. our study demonstrated that abi<0.9, high bapwv, and high lvmi were independently associated with an interarm sbp difference of 10 mmhg or more. detection of an interarm sbp difference may provide a simple method of detecting patients at increased risk of atherosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy. background knowledge of the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (pad) in patients with chronic renal failure (crf) is limited because of a lack of uniformity in disease definition and recognition. furthermore, little is known of the prevalence of medial arterial calcification (mac) in patients with crf. our goal is to study the prevalence of pad and mac defined by ankle brachial index (abi) or toe brachial index (tbi) measurements in a finnish population of patients with crf consisting of predialysis and dialysis patients, as well as renal transplant recipients.   methods we examined 136 patients with crf and 59 control subjects. fifty-nine of the patients with crf had moderate to severe predialysis crf, 36 patients were on dialysis treatment, and 41 were renal transplant recipients. mean age of patients was 51.9 +/- 11.5 years, and 39 patients (29%) had diabetes. abi and tbi were measured by means of photoplethysmography. the definition of pad required an abi value of 0.90 or less, a tbi value of 0.60 or less, or a previous positive lower-extremity angiogram result. abi values of 1.3 or greater or incompressible arteries at ankle level indicated mac. the presence of claudication was determined by an interview.   results prevalences of pad on this study were 22.0% in patients with predialysis crf, 30.6% in patients on dialysis treatment, 14.6% in renal transplant recipients, and 1.7% in the control group (p = 0.001). prevalences of mac were 23.7%, 41.7%, 23.1%, and 3.4% (p < 0.001), respectively. only 9 patients had claudication, and 6 of those patients had pad.   conclusion both asymptomatic pad and mac are common in patients with crf. therefore, we recommend the use of both abi and tbi measurements in the evaluation of pad in patients with crf.
oestradiol (e(2)) accelerates oviductal transport of oocytes in cycling rats through a nongenomic pathway that involves the camp-pka signalling cascade. here we examined the role of the inositol triphosphate (ip3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signalling cascades in this nongenomic pathway. oestrous rats were injected with e(2) s.c. and intrabursally (i.b) with the selective inhibitors of phospholipase c (plc) et-18-och(3) or mapk pd98059. the number of eggs in the oviduct assessed 24 h later showed that et-18-och(3) blocked e(2)-induced egg transport acceleration, whereas pd98059 had no effect. other oestrous rats were treated with e(2) s.c. and 1, 3 or 6 h later oviducts were excised and the levels of ip3 and phosphorylated mapk p44/42 (activated) were determined by radioreceptor assay and western blot, respectively. oestradiol administration increased ip3 level at 1 and 6 h after treatment, whereas activated mapk p44/42 level was unchanged. finally, we explored whether camp-pka and plc-ip3 signalling cascades are coupled. inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by i.b. injection of sq 22536 blocked the increase of ip3 levels induced by e(2), while inhibition of plc by et-18-och(3) had no effect on e(2)-induced pka activity. furthermore, activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin increased oviductal ip3 levels. thus, activation of plc-ip3 by e(2) requires previous stimulation of camp-pka. we conclude that the nongenomic pathway utilised by e(2) to accelerate oviductal transport of oocytes in cycling rats involves successive activation of the camp-pka and plc-ip3 signalling cascades and does not require activation of mapk. these findings clearly illustrate a non-genomic pathway triggered by e(2) that regulates a complex physiologic process accomplished by an entire organ. abstract this investigation examined the role of estrogen receptor (er) on the stimulatory effect of estradiol (e2) on protein phosphorylation in the oviduct as well as on e2-induced acceleration of oviductal oocyte transport in cyclic rats. estrous rats were injected with e2 s.c. and with the er antagonist ici 182 780 intrabursally (i.b.), and 6 h later, oviducts were excised and protein phosphorylation was determined by western blot analysis. ici 182 780 inhibited the e2-induced phosphorylation of some oviductal proteins. other estrous rats were treated with e2 s.c. and ici 182 780 i.b. the number of eggs in the oviduct, assessed 24 h later, showed that ici 182 780 blocked the e2-induced egg transport acceleration. the possible involvement of adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase a (pk-a), protein kinase c (pk-c), or tyrosine kinases on egg transport acceleration induced by e2 was then examined. selective inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase or pk-a inhibited the e2-induced egg transport acceleration, whereas pk-c or tyrosine kinase inhibitors had no effect. furthermore, forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, mimicked the effect of e2 on ovum transport and e2 increased the level of camp in the oviduct of cycling rats. finally, we measured pk-a activity in vitro in the presence of e2 or e2-er complex. activity of pk-a in the presence of e2 or e2-er was similar to pk-a alone, showing that e2 or e2-er did not directly activate pk-a. we conclude that the nongenomic pathway by which e2 accelerates oviductal egg transport in the rat requires absolute participation of er and camp and partial participation of pk-a signaling pathways in the oviduct.
brain activity was monitored while participants viewed picture sets that reflected high or low levels of arousal and positive, neutral, or negative valence. pictures within a set were presented rapidly in an incidental viewing task while fmri data were collected. the primary purpose of the study was to determine if multi-voxel pattern analysis could be used within and between participants to predict valence, arousal and combined affective states elicited by pictures based on distributed patterns of whole brain activity. a secondary purpose was to determine if distributed patterns of whole brain activity can be used to derive a lower dimensional representation of affective states consistent with behavioral data. results demonstrated above chance prediction of valence, arousal and affective states that was robust across a wide range of number of voxels used in prediction. additionally, individual differences multidimensional scaling based on fmri data clearly separated valence and arousal levels and was consistent with a circumplex model of affective states. previous functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the amygdala activates in response to fearful faces presented below the threshold of conscious visual perception. using a backward masking procedure similar to that of previous studies, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to study the amygdala and anterior cingulate gyrus during preattentive presentations of sad and happy facial affect. twelve healthy adult females underwent blood oxygen level dependent (bold) fmri while viewing sad and happy faces, each presented for 20 ms and "masked" immediately by a neutral face for 100 ms. masked happy faces were associated with significant bilateral activation within the anterior cingulate gyrus and amygdala, whereas masked sadness yielded only limited activation within the left anterior cingulate gyrus. in a direct comparison, masked happy faces yielded significantly greater activation in the anterior cingulate and amygdala relative to identically masked sad faces. conjunction analysis showed that masked affect perception, regardless of emotional valence, was associated with greater activation within the left amygdala and left anterior cingulate. findings suggest that the amygdala and anterior cingulate are important components of a network involved in detecting and discriminating affective information presented below the normal threshold of conscious visual perception.
due to increased migration, chagas disease has become an international health problem. reliable diagnosis of chronically infected people is crucial for prevention of non-vectorial transmission as well as treatment. this study compared four distinct pcr methods for detection of trypanosoma cruzi dna for the use in well-equipped routine diagnostic laboratories. dna was extracted of t. cruzi-positive and negative patients' blood samples and cultured t. cruzi, t. rangeli as well as leishmania spp. one conventional and two real-time pcr methods targeting a repetitive sat-dna sequence as well as one conventional pcr method targeting the variable region of the kdna minicircle were compared for sensitivity, intra- and interassay precision, limit of detection, specificity and cross-reactivity. considering the performance, costs and ease of use, an algorithm for pcr-diagnosis of patients with a positive serology for t. cruzi antibodies was developed. an international study was performed by 26 experienced pcr laboratories from 14 countries to assess the performance of duplex quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) strategies on the basis of taqman probes for detection and quantification of parasitic loads in peripheral blood samples from chagas disease patients. two methods were studied: satellite dna (satdna) qpcr and kinetoplastid dna (kdna) qpcr. both methods included an internal amplification control. reportable range, analytical sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification, and precision were estimated according to international guidelines. in addition, inclusivity and exclusivity were estimated with dna from stocks representing the different trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units and trypanosoma rangeli and leishmania spp. both methods were challenged against 156 blood samples provided by the participant laboratories, including samples from acute and chronic patients with varied clinical findings, infected by oral route or vectorial transmission. kdna qpcr showed better analytical sensitivity than satdna qpcr with limits of detection of 0.23 and 0.70 parasite equivalents/ml, respectively. analyses of clinical samples revealed a high concordance in terms of sensitivity and parasitic loads determined by both satdna and kdna qpcrs. this effort is a major step toward international validation of qpcr methods for the quantification of t. cruzi dna in human blood samples, aiming to provide an accurate surrogate biomarker for diagnosis and treatment monitoring for patients with chagas disease.
we know that upper body obesity is associated with metabolic complications, but we don't know how regional body fat distribution influences postprandial lipemia in obese adults. thus, this study explored the respective effects of android or gynoid types of obesity and fasting triglyceridemia on postprandial lipid metabolism and especially triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. twenty-four obese and 6 lean normotriglyceridemic women (control), age 24-57 yr, were enrolled. among obese women with an android phenotype, 9 exhibited normal plasma triglyceride levels (mean: 1.38 mmol/l) (ntao), and 7 displayed a frank hypertriglyceridemia (mean: 2.40 mmol/l) (htao). the 8 patients with a gynoid phenotype had normal triglyceride levels (mean: 1.00 mmol/l) (go). all were given a mixed test meal providing 40 g triglycerides. serum and incremental chylomicron triglycerides 0-7 h areas under the curve (aucs) as well as triglyceride levels in apob-48-containing triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (trls) or chylomicrons were significantly higher in htaos and ntaos than in gos and controls postprandially. the size of chylomicron particles was bigger in controls and gos than in htaos and ntaos postprandially. android obese subjects showed abnormally elevated fasting apob-48 and apob-100 triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (trl) levels. most abnormalities that were found correlated to plasma levels of insulin and apoc-iii. in conclusion, an abnormal postprandial lipid pattern is a trait of abdominal obesity even without fasting hypertriglyceridemia. apoliprotein (apo) b-100-containing very low density lipoprotein (vldl) particles secreted from the liver accumulate in plasma during alimentary lipemia. to determine whether changes of vldl composition occur in the postprandial state that may render these lipoproteins more atherogenic, apoe, c-i, c-ii, and c-iii, and lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol) were measured in svedberg flotation (sf) 60-400 (large) and sf 20-60 (small) vldl before and after an oral fat load. ten normotriglyceridemic (ntg) and three hypertriglyceridemic (htg) healthy men were given a fat-rich mixed meal (1,000 kcal with 60.2 e% from fat). triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from plasma samples obtained before (fasting) and at 2-h intervals after the meal. vldl was then separated from chylomicrons and their remnants by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies 4g3 and 5e11, recognizing apob-100, but not apob-48 epitopes. large and small vldl isolated from the ntg group were enriched with apoe and c-i, and cholesterol, but depleted of apoc-ii in the postprandial state, whereas the apoc-iii, triglyceride, and phospholipid contents were essentially unchanged. the compositional changes of vldl in htg subjects were similar but more pronounced compared with ntg subjects. we conclude that postprandial lipemia in healthy men induces transient compositional alterations of vldl that link these lipoprotein species to the formation of atherosclerosis.
prior research has shown that the two writing systems of the japanese orthography are processed differently: kana (syllabic symbols) are processed like other phonetic languages such as english, while kanji (a logographic writing system) are processed like other logographic languages such as chinese. previous work done with the stroop task in japanese has shown that these differences in processing strategies create differences in stroop effects. this study investigated the stroop effect in kana and kanji using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to examine the similarities and differences in brain processing between logographic and phonetic languages. nine native japanese speakers performed the stroop task in both kana and kanji scripts during fmri. both scripts individually produced significant stroop effects as measured by the behavioral reaction time data. the imaging data for both scripts showed brain activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus, an area involved in inhibiting automatic processing. though behavioral data showed no significant differences between the stroop effects in kana and kanji, there were differential areas of activation in fmri found for each writing system. in fmri, the stroop task activated an area in the left inferior parietal lobule during the kana task and the left inferior frontal gyrus during the kanji task. the results of the present study suggest that the stroop task in japanese kana and kanji elicits differential activation in brain regions involved in conflict detection and resolution for syllabic and logographic writing systems. in order to separate the cognitive processes associated with phonological encoding and the use of a visual word form lexicon in reading, it is desirable to compare the processing of words presented in a visually familiar form with words in a visually unfamiliar form. japanese kana orthography offers this possibility. two phonologically equivalent but visually dissimilar syllabaries allow the writing of, for example, foreign loanwords in two ways, only one of which is visually familiar. familiarly written words, unfamiliarly written words, and pseudowords were presented in both kana syllabaries (yielding six conditions in total) to participants during an fmri measurement with a silent articulation task (experiment 1) and a phonological lexical decision task (experiment 2) using an event-related design. consistent over two experimental tasks, the three different stimulus types (familiar, unfamiliar, and pseudoword) were found to activate selectively different brain regions previously associated with phonological encoding and word retrieval or meaning. compatible with the predictions of the dual-route model for reading, pseudowords and visually unfamiliar words, which have to be read using phonological assembly, caused an increase in brain activity in left inferior frontal regions (ba 44/47), as compared to visually familiar words. visually familiar and unfamiliar words were found to activate a range of areas associated with lexico-semantic processing more strongly than pseudowords, such as the left and right temporo-parietal region (ba 39/40), a region in the left middle/inferior temporal gyrus (ba 20/21), and the posterior cingulate (ba 31).
electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 healthy subjects (students) in the state of rest with eyes open and during memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (the latin and russian languages) and retrieval of information from memory (control). the estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared for the following frequency bands: θ (4–7 hz), α1 (7–10 hz), α2 (10–13 hz), β1 (13–18 hz), β2 (18–30 hz), and γ (30–40 hz). compared to the state of rest, the decrease in coherence in the pairs of derivations from the frontal and central cortical areas in all eeg frequency bands was the most pronounced for memorization, and the increase in coherence in the interhemispheric derivation pairs of the parietal-occipital region in most of the frequency bands was the most pronounced for retrieval. in addition, in the pairs formed by derivations from the parietal-occipital region with derivations from the frontal and central regions, retrieval is also characterized by an increase in coherence in the β2 and γ bands along with its decrease in the low-frequency ranges. the dynamics of eeg coherence, when comparing the states of memorization and retrieval, is more statistically significant in the interhemispheric and cross-hemispheric pairs of derivations than in the intrahemispheric pairs. the revealed topographic specificity of the dynamics of eeg coherence owing to the change of state is considered in terms of the notion on cognitive-specific forms of sustained goal-directed mental attention. electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 subjects (students) in states of: rest with the eyes open; memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (latin and russian); and recollection (control) of the memorized information. estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared using statistical methods for the frequency bands θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ. the results of this comparison showed that transition from the state of rest to those of memorization and recollection was accompanied by numerous changes in coherence in all the frequency bands. these changes varied in intensity and embrace practically the entire convexital cerebral cortex. decrease in eeg coherence was predominant during the transition to the memorization state in various frequency bands, whereas during the transition from the rest state to that of recollection, eeg coherence increased in most of the frequency bands except for the band α2. the reproducibility of this pattern of changes in eeg coherence is confirmed by the results in the subgroups formed by randomly subdividing the subjects into two groups. we think that the observed intense rearrangement of the spatial synchronization of the cortex electrical activity reflects the reorganization of the functional systems of neuronal ensembles to provide efficient memorization and recollection, respectively.
purpose to characterize human corneal psychophysical channels.   methods twenty subjects participated in this study. a belmonte pneumatic esthesiometer was used to deliver stimuli, and the ascending method of limits and the method of constant stimuli were used to estimate thresholds. sensation was characterized for different stimuli. corneal mechanical and chemical thresholds were measured at different temperatures.   results the qualities of the sensations induced by stimuli with different temperatures were different, and the corresponding detection thresholds of the pneumatic stimuli at four temperatures gradually increased (repeated measures anova (f(3,12) = 10.326, p = 0.000). there were no temperature effects on chemical thresholds (repeated measures anova f(3,12) = 0.235, p = 0.870) or mechanical discomfort thresholds from 20 degrees c to 50 degrees c (paired t14 = -0.233, p = 0.818). there were strong interactions when chemical and mechanical stimuli were added. chemical thresholds were progressively lower when the flow rate increased and mechanical thresholds went down as the percentage of added co2 increased (repeated measures anova f(3, 12) = 6.407, p = 0.007, f(4, 16) = 19.904, p = 0.000).   conclusions this study suggests that humans sense corneal non-noxious cold and noxious mechanical and chemical stimuli, and that the sensitivity of some submodalities can be modulated by others. there are at least five psychophysical channels (non-noxious cold, noxious mechanical, noxious chemical-h+, noxious heat, and itching) processing corneal sensory information. both decreased corneal chemical thresholds at high flow rates and decreased mechanical thresholds with an added chemical stimulation demonstrate that corneal psychophysical channels are not independent. 1 the cornea of human subjects and of anaesthetised cats was stimulated with a jet of air of controlled flow, temperature and co2 concentration delivered by a gas aesthesiometer. 2 in humans, the intensity and magnitude of various components of the sensory experience (intensity of the sensation, degree of irritation, magnitude of burning and stinging pain, magnitude of the cold and warm components of the sensation) were measured using separate visual analog scales. in anaesthetised cats, the impulse response to the same stimuli was recorded from single mechanosensory, polymodal and cold‐sensitive corneal fibres in the ciliary nerves. 3 intensity‐response curves for mechanical stimulation showed that all parameters of the sensation experienced by humans increased with the intensity of the stimulus. mechanical stimuli recruited mainly phasic mechanosensory and polymodal afferents in the cat. 4 acidic stimulation with gas mixtures of increasing co2 concentration evoked irritation, burning and to a lesser extent stinging pain of a magnitude roughly proportional to the intensity of the stimulus in humans. co2 primarily recruited polymodal afferents and weakly excited cold‐sensitive fibres in the cat's cornea. 5 heat stimuli evoked in humans a sensation profile similar to co2 but accompanied by a warmth component. in the cat's cornea, heat excited only polymodal fibres and silenced cold‐sensitive corneal units. 6 cold stimuli applied to the human cornea elicited a sensation of cooling that became irritant at the lowest temperatures. corneal cold‐sensitive fibres of the cat were activated in a manner proportional to the temperature drop, while polymodal nociceptor fibres were recruited only by the lowest temperatures. topical menthol (0.2 mm) applied to humans evoked and later eliminated cold sensations produced by cold stimuli while the irritation sensation caused by low temperature stimuli still persisted. 7 human subjects were able to identify masked mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli applied to the cornea. 8 irritation and cold sensations can therefore be evoked separately from the cornea by selective activation of mechanosensory, polymodal and cold corneal sensory afferents. stimulation with different forms of energy usually leads to combined activation and/or inhibition of the different populations of sensory afferent fibres, evoking blended sensations that include irritation and thermal components in a variable degree.
current means of measuring rt-induced fibrosis are subjective. we evaluated the dermalab suction cup system to measure objectively skin deflection as a surrogate for fibrosis. sixty-nine patients with e-sts were treated with limb-sparing surgery and 50–66 grays (gy) of rt. using a “scleroderma” dermalab suction cup, the skin stiffness was measured by two clinicians. the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (nci-ctcae) scale, the musculoskeletal tumor rating scale (msts) and toronto extremity salvage score (tess) questionnaires were completed for each patient. levels of agreement between measurers were estimated using the kappa (κ) coefficient and the concordance correlation coefficient (ccc). all sixty-nine patients were included. the level of agreement between measurers for nci-ctcae grading was moderate (range κ = 0.41–0.59). the ccc for the elasticity measurements were higher, with ccc = 0.82 for fibrotic skin and ccc = 0.84 for normal skin. the elasticity measurements were significantly higher when msts scores were <30 and or tess scores were <90. suction cup measurement of skin elasticity is more reproducible than ctcae grading and shows promise in generating reproducible measurements for radiation-induced skin fibrosis. furthermore, it correlates well with the msts and tess. purpose to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of various signs of late morbidity, their time of appearance and pattern of progression during an observation period up to 34 years in breast cancer patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy after radical mastectomy.   methods and materials a group of 71 breast cancer patients received in 1963-1965 aggressive postoperative telecobalt therapy to the parasternal, axillary, and supraclavicular lymph node regions after total mastectomy and axillary clearance. none of the patients received chemotherapy either prior to, or after the irradiation as part of their primary treatment. the prescribed dose to the three lymph node regions was 44 gy in 11 fractions. only two of the three fields were treated per day. this total dose was given in 16-17 fractions over 3-4 weeks. because of the overlap of the supraclavicular and axillary fields, the dose received by the brachial plexus was not the dose that was prescribed. a retrospective dose calculation showed that the total dose to the brachial plexus was 57 gy, delivered as a complex combination of 1.8 gy, 3.4 gy, and 5.2 gy fractions. this cohort of patients has now been followed to 34 years and the late side effects of the treatment evaluated and scored.   results this series is unique in the literature. there is no comparable report of a detailed long-term follow-up in a homogeneously treated group of patients with such a high survival, especially among the younger women, where it is almost 50% at 30 years. this is the reason that they were able to develop some of the very slowly evolving injuries. there was progression of many of the late effects in the period between 5 and 34 years. the more serious morbidities have increased progressively over the whole 34-year follow-up period. ninety-two percent of the long-term survivors have paralysis of their arm. other neurological findings included unilateral vocal cord paralysis among 5% of the patients, who developed the disease after a median time of 19 years. all of them were left-sided, indicating a mediastinal involvement of the recurrent nerve. local recurrence or the appearance of a new primary tumor infiltrating or causing pressure on the recurrent nerve were vigorously investigated and excluded as possible causes of these symptoms.   conclusion the greatest risk for all cancer patients is the inadequate treatment of their disease, because this is inevitably lethal. the aggressiveness of the therapy and the acceptable risk of complications must therefore be balanced against the risk of recurrence. the neuropathy seems to be closely linked to the development of fibrosis around the nerve trunks. the use of large daily fractions, combined with hot spots from overlapping fields contributed to the severity of the complications.
aims although acute venous thrombo-embolism (vte) often afflicts patients with advanced age, the predictors of in-hospital mortality for elderly vte patients are unknown.   methods and results among 1247 consecutive patients with acute vte from the prospective swiss venous thromboembolism registry (swivter), 644 (52%) were elderly (≥65 years of age). in comparison to younger patients, the elderly more often had pulmonary embolism (pe) (60 vs. 42%; p< 0.001), cancer (30 vs. 20%; p< 0.001), chronic lung disease (14 vs. 8%; p= 0.001), and congestive heart failure (12 vs. 2%; p< 0.001). elderly vte patients were more often hospitalized (75 vs. 52%; p< 0.001), and there was no difference in the use of thrombolysis, catheter intervention, or surgical embolectomy between the elderly and younger pe patients (5 vs. 6%; p= 0.54), despite a trend towards a higher rate of massive pe in the elderly (8 vs. 4%; p= 0.07). the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 6.6% in the elderly vs. 3.2% in the younger vte patients (p= 0.033). cancer was associated with in-hospital death both in the elderly [hazard ratio (hr) 4.91, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.32-10.38; p< 0.001] and in the younger patients (hr 4.90, 95% ci 1.37-17.59; p= 0.015); massive pe was a predictor of in-hospital death in the elderly only (hr 3.77, 95% ci 1.63-8.74; p= 0.002).   conclusion elderly patients had more serious vte than younger patients, and massive pe was particularly life-threatening in the elderly. while the magnitude of venous thromboembolism (vte) increases dramatically with advancing age, relatively little is known about the contemporary management of vte in the elderly and the impact of age on associated short- and long-term outcomes. the objectives of this population-based study were to compare the clinical characteristics, treatment practices, and outcomes of subjects > or = 65 years with vte to those of younger patients. the medical records of residents of the worcester (ma, usa) metropolitan area with icd-9 codes consistent with vte during 1999, 2001, and 2003 were independently validated and reviewed by trained data abstractors. information about patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, hospital management practices, and hospital and long-term outcomes was collected. there were a total of 1,897 validated events of vte - 1,048 (55%) occurred in patients > or = 65 years of age. patients > or = 65 years were less likely to have "unprovoked" vte than younger patients. they were less likely to receive parenteral anticoagulation or warfarin as acute treatment. rates of recurrent vte did not differ significantly between patients 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients but the adjusted rates of major bleeding were increased approximately two-fold in older patients. in conclusion, advancing age is not a predictor of recurrent vte but is associated with a significant increase in major bleeding episodes. physicians treating elderly patients with vte should continue to base their decisions on clinical characteristics previously shown to impact the risk of recurrent vte. these decisions must be tempered by our observation that major bleeding occurs frequently in these patients.
the antimicrobial activities of thymol and carvacrol were assessed against a selection of verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) strains (n=11) and other bacterial species and spoilage bacteria (n=7) using a model broth system. the effects of ph, temperature, water activity, sodium chloride concentrations, inoculum size and the presence of competing microflora on the activities of thymol and carvacrol against e. coli o157:h7 strain 380-94 were also determined. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (mic and mbc, respectively) and numbers of surviving e. coli o157:h7 were determined following incubation. the mean numbers of vtec surviving exposure to thymol or carvacrol at concentrations of >/=500mug/ml were between 2.0 and 7.8log cfu/ml less than the numbers in the corresponding controls. the susceptibility of e. coli o157:h7 to carvacrol or thymol was found to increase with decreasing storage temperature, water activity, ph and e. coli o157:h7 inoculum size. sodium chloride (0.5-2.5%) and the presence of a microflora cocktail did not significantly (p>0.05) affect the antimicrobial activities of thymol or carvacrol against e. coli o157:h7. the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol against e. coli o157:h7 was also tested in a model rumen system. a mic of 500mug/ml carvacrol reduced e. coli o157:h7 inoculated at levels of 10(3) and 10(6)cfu/ml to undetectable levels in the system after 24h incubation. this concentration of carvacrol significantly (p<0.05) decreased the total gas production and volatile fatty acid concentrations in the model rumen assay. the effect of mint (mentha piperita) essential oil (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0%, v/w) on salmonella enteritidis and listeria monocytogenes in a culture medium and three model foods; tzatziki (ph 4.5), taramosalata (ph 5.0) and pâté (ph 6.8), inoculated at 10(7) cfu g-1, at 4 degrees and 10 degrees c for ca 1 week was studied. in the culture medium supplemented with the essential oil, no growth was observed over 2 d at 30 degrees c determined by a conductance method with a malthus 2000 growth analyser. salmonella enteritidis died in tzatziki in all treatments and declined in the other foods except for pâté at 10 degrees c as judged with viable counts. listeria monocytogenes populations showed a declining trend towards the end of the storage period but was increased in pâté. mint essential oil antibacterial action depended mainly on its concentration, food ph, composition, storage temperature and the nature of the micro-organism.
abstract measurement standards for pulmonary diffusing capacity were updated in 2005 by the ats/ers task force. however, in finland reference values published in 1982 by viljanen et al. have been used to date. the main aim of this study was to produce updated reference models for single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide for finnish adults. single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was measured in 631 healthy non-smoking volunteers (41.5% male). reference values for diffusing capacity (dlco), alveolar volume (va), diffusing capacity per unit of lung volume (dlco/va), and lung volumes were calculated using a linear regression model. previously used finnish reference values were found to produce too low predicted values, with mean predicted dlco 111.0 and 104.4%, and dlco/va of 103.5 and 102.7% in males and females, respectively. with the european coalition for steel and coal (ecsc) reference values there was a significant sex difference in dlco/va with mean predicted 105.4% in males and 92.8% in females (p < .001). new reference values for dlco, dlco/va, va, vital capacity (vc), inspiratory vital capacity (ivc), and inspiratory capacity (ic) are suggested for clinical use to replace technically outdated reference values for clinical applications. ### 1.1 what is being measured  the lung is the organ of external respiration for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the surrounding air. the stages in the process of gas transfer include:  1. ventilation of the airways and some air spaces by bulk flow of gas;  2. mixing and diffusion of gases in the alveolar ducts, air sacs and alveoli;  3. transfer of gases across the gaseous to liquid interface of the alveolar membrane;  4. mixing and diffusion in the lung parenchyma and alveolar capillary plasma;  5. chemical reaction with constituents of blood;  6. circulation of blood between the pulmonary and systemic vascular beds.  the capacity of the lung to exchange gas is determined by the structural and functional dimensions of these processes. the structural dimensions include the lung volume, the path length for diffusion in the gas phase, the thickness and area of the alveolar capillary membrane including any effects of airway closure, and the volume of blood in capillaries supplying alveoli which are ventilated. the principal functional dimensions are the absolute levels of ventilation and perfusion and the uniformity of their distribution with respect to both each other and the diffusion characteristics of the membrane. other functional dimensions are the quantity of haemoglobin in the alveolar capillaries, the composition of the alveolar gas, the gas tensions in blood entering the alveolar capillaries, the rates of chemical reaction with haemoglobin and of dissociation of the compound so formed, the transit time of blood through that part of the pulmonary vascular bed which exchanges gas with the alveoli and the slope of the relevant haemoglobin dissociation curve. the latter is a function of the temperature of the lung and the prevailing levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; many of these variables are dependent on the level of …
ras proteins undergo an incompletely understood trafficking process in the cell. rasosomes are protein nanoparticles of 80–100 nm diameter that carry lipidated ras isoforms (h-ras and n-ras) as well as their effectors through the cytoplasm and near the plasma membrane (pm). in this study, we identified the subcellular origin of rasosomes and how they spread ras proteins through the cell. we found no dependency of rasosome formation on galectins, or on the gdp-/gtp-bound state of ras. we found that significantly more rasosomes are associated with forms of ras that are localized to the golgi, namely n-ras or the singly palmitoylated h-ras mutant (c181s). to explore the possibility that rasosome originate from the golgi, we used photoactivatable (pa)-gfp-h-ras mutants and showed that rasosomes bud from the golgi in a two-step mechanism. newly released rasosomes first move in an energy-dependent directed fashion and then convert to randomly diffusing rasosomes. dual fluorescence time-lapse imaging revealed the appearance of dually labeled rasosomes, indicating a dynamic exchange of cytoplasmic and pm-associated ras with rasosome-associated ras. finally, higher levels of rasosomes correlate with higher levels of erk phosphorylation, a key marker of ras downstream signaling. we suggest that h-ras and n-ras proteins exchange with rasosomes that can function as carriers of palmitoylated ras and its signals. we identify a role for the gdi-like solubilizing factor (gsf) pdeδ in modulating signalling through ras family g proteins by sustaining their dynamic distribution in cellular membranes. we show that the gdi-like pocket of pdeδ binds and solubilizes farnesylated ras proteins, thereby enhancing their diffusion in the cytoplasm. this mechanism allows more effective trapping of depalmitoylated ras proteins at the golgi and polycationic ras proteins at the plasma membrane to counter the entropic tendency to distribute these proteins over all intracellular membranes. thus, pdeδ activity augments k/hras signalling by enriching ras at the plasma membrane; conversely, pdeδ down-modulation randomizes ras distributions to all membranes in the cell and suppresses regulated signalling through wild-type ras and also constitutive oncogenic ras signalling in cancer cells. our findings link the activity of pdeδ in determining ras protein topography to ras-dependent signalling.
retrieval of spermatozoa is unfortunately still only successful in a subset of patients suffering from non‐obstructive azoospermia (noa) by conventional testicular sperm extraction (tese). microdissection tese may have some theoretical benefits over conventional tese, but uncertainty exists about its superiority. the objective of this systematic review was therefore to compare the efficacy and safety of microtese with conventional tese in men with noa. the systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis statement. literature was searched for studies comparing outcome of conventional tese with microdissection tese. primary outcome was sperm retrieval rate (srr). secondary outcomes were clinical predictors of sperm retrieval as well as complication rate. of 62 articles, a total of seven studies were included in the final analysis. overall srr was significantly higher in the microtese group in comparison with conventional tese in five of these studies. overall sperm retrieval ranged from 16.7 to 45% in the conventional tese vs. 42.9 to 63% in the microtese group. a sub‐analysis of the srr according to testicular histology was available in four of the selected articles. microtese in men with sertoli cell only syndrome and hypospermatogenesis carried a small but significant more favourable outcome according to, respectively, two and one of the studies. correlation of serum follicle stimulating hormone and testicular volume with positive outcome was variable. fewer complications were observed on ultrasound examination after microtese procedure. clinical randomized studies comparing microtese with conventional tese in noa are still lacking to date. pseudo‐randomized prospective data, however, show more favourable sperm retrieval in noa for microtese, especially in histological patterns of patchy spermatogenesis such as sertoli cell only syndrome. however, in patients with uniform histological patterns such as maturation arrest outcome of microtese seems less favourable. in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
saccadic eye movements generated in response to a gap paradigm in which the fixation light spot was extinguished 200 ms prior to presentation of the target light spot showed appreciably shorter latencies than for the overlap paradigm in which the target light spot was presented 200 ms prior to extinction of the fixation light spot. when there was unpredictability in the direction of target presentation, i.e., to the left or right of the fixation light spot, the gap paradigm evoked mainly fast regular saccades of peak latency of 155 ms with relatively few express saccades which were defined as having latencies of less than 120 ms. by contrast, when the target always appeared to the right, a substantial population of express saccades with peak latency 95 ms was now generated. there was also a change in the relationship between saccadic latency and target angular displacement which covered the range 5-35 degrees . with the overlap paradigm and unpredictability of target direction, the latencies of the slow regular saccades increased markedly with target angular displacement. this was not the case with the same target direction when the latency of slow regular, fast regular, and express saccades remained constant with increasing target angular displacement. this indicates for targets appearing in the same hemifield that the ocular motor system operates with shortest latency irrespective of target angular displacement. backgroundpredictions from conduction velocity data for primate retinal ganglion cell axons indicate that the conduction time to the lateral geniculate nucleus for stimulation of peripheral retina should be no longer than for stimulation of central retina. on this basis, the latency of saccadic eye movements should not increase for more peripherally located targets. however, previous studies have reported relatively very large increases, which has the implication of a very considerable increase in central processing time for the saccade-generating system.resultsin order to resolve this paradox, we have undertaken an extended series of experiments in which saccadic eye movements were recorded by electro-oculography in response to targets presented in the horizontal meridian in normal young subjects. for stationary or moving targets of either normal beam intensity or reduced red intensity, with the direction of gaze either straight ahead with respect to the head or directed eccentrically, the saccadic latency was shown to remain invariant with respect to a wide range of target angular displacements.conclusionsthese results indicate that, irrespective of the angular displacement of the target, the direction of gaze or the target intensity, the saccade-generating system operates with a constant generation time.
visual search tasks have standardly been divided into two categories: those in which the target is detected through a serial, attention-driven search and those in which the target is detected rapidly in parallel and, apparently, without attentional processing. several studies have examined this distinction in patients with hemispatial neglect with the clear prediction that the former, but not the latter, should be impaired. these studies, however, have proved inconclusive. we have addressed this issue in a large sample of patients with unilateral hemispheric infarcts to the left or right hemisphere. in addition to measuring the patients' performance on both types of visual search tasks, we documented the presence and severity of neglect and of visual field defects in these same individuals. patients with brain-damage with or without accompanying neglect were impaired at searching for the contralateral target on both forms of visual search, relative to normal control subjects, although this deficit was magnified in individuals with neglect and was also exacerbated by the presence of hemianopia. this pattern was also more pronounced in individuals with right-than with left-hemisphere lesions. the findings not only clarify the contradictory neuropsychological data but also provide clear evidence for the involvement of attentional processing in all forms of visual search. patients with hemispatial neglect fail to respond to stimuli on one side of space. we assessed to what extent the complexity and number of visual stimuli on both sides determine the severity of neglect. patients with neglect were required to find specified targets in a cluttered visual field. two sets of stimuli were used. one set produced effortless and parallel search performance in normal controls; the other set was more complex and produced serial search performance in normal controls. both sets of stimuli resulted in a serial performance pattern in the patients. their baseline search performance on both sides was similar when all stimulus items were restricted to one side. a pronounced difference between the two sides was evident when stimuli appeared on both sides. search for targets on the intact side of space was unaffected by distractors on the neglected side, whereas search for targets on the neglected side was slowed disproportionately by distractors on the intact side. the slowing on the neglected side was more severe during the more demanding search task and when more items were present on the intact side. the results indicate that neglect is associated with an inability to move attention from objects on the intact side to items on the neglected side.
cyclic nucleotide-gated (cng) ion channels are key mediators underlying signal transduction in retinal and olfactory receptors. genetic defects in cnga3 and cngb3, encoding two structurally related subunits of cone cng channels, lead to achromatopsia (achm). achm is a congenital, autosomal recessive retinal disorder that manifests by cone photoreceptor dysfunction, severely reduced visual acuity, impaired or complete color blindness and photophobia. here, we report the first canine models for cnga3-associated channelopathy caused by r424w or v644del mutations in the canine cnga3 ortholog that accurately mimic the clinical and molecular features of human cnga3-associated achm. these two spontaneous mutations exposed cnga3 residues essential for the preservation of channel function and biogenesis. the cnga3-r424w results in complete loss of cone function in vivo and channel activity confirmed by in vitro electrophysiology. structural modeling and molecular dynamics (md) simulations revealed r424-e306 salt bridge formation and its disruption with the r424w mutant. reversal of charges in a cnga3-r424e-e306r double mutant channel rescued cgmp-activated currents uncovering new insights into channel gating. the cnga3-v644del affects the c-terminal leucine zipper (clz) domain destabilizing intersubunit interactions of the coiled-coil complex in the md simulations; the in vitro experiments showed incompetent trimeric cnga3 subunit assembly consistent with abnormal biogenesis of in vivo channels. these newly characterized large animal models not only provide a valuable system for studying cone-specific cng channel function in health and disease, but also represent prime candidates for proof-of-concept studies of cnga3 gene replacement therapy for achm patients. cone degeneration (cd ) is an autosomal recessive canine disease that occurs naturally in the alaskan malamute and german shorthaired pointer breeds. it is phenotypically similar to human achromatopsia, a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder associated with three distinct loci. both the canine disease and its human counterparts are characterized by day-blindness and absence of retinal cone function in adults. we report linkage of the canine cd locus to marker c29.002 on canine chromosome 29 at recombination fraction theta = 0.0 with a maximum lod score of 24.68 in a series of informative outbred pedigrees derived from cd-affected alaskan malamutes. conserved gene order between cfa29 and the long arm of human chromosome 8 argued for homology between the cd locus and the human achromatopsia locus, achm3, at 8q21-22. the canine homolog of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta-subunit gene (cngb3), responsible for the human achm3 disease phenotype, was mapped within the zero-recombination interval for the cd locus. a deletion removing all exons of canine cngb3 was identified in cd-affected alaskan malamute-derived dogs. a missense mutation in exon 6 (d262n, nucleotide 784) within a conserved region of the same gene was detected in german shorthaired pointers affected with an allelic disorder. identification of these canine disorders as homologs of human achm3 underscores the power of recent developments in canine genomics, and provides a valuable system for exploring disease mechanisms and evaluating potential therapeutic measures in disorders of cone photoreceptors.
gallibacterium has recently been included as a new genus of the family pasteurellaceae pohl 1981, which encompasses bacteria previously reported as pasteurella anatis, [actinobacillus] salpingitidis and avian pasteurella haemolytica-like organisms. identification has, so far, exclusively relied on phenotypical characterization. here we present a method based on a cy3 labelled in situ hybridization probe targeting 16s rrna to allow specific detection of bacteria belonging to the genus gallibacterium. the probe, gan850, showed no cross-reactivity to 25 other poultry associated bacterial species including members of the families pasteurellaceae, enterobacteriaceae and flavobacteriaceae, when evaluated by whole cell hybridization. the probe was further evaluated by hybridization to formalin-fixed spleen and liver tissues from experimentally infected chickens, in which it proved useful for detection of gallibacterium. additionally, spatial distribution and host-cell affiliation of gallibacterium, at various time points during the infection process, was possible. in conclusion, the in situ hybridization technique described may be of use as a diagnostic tool as well as for studies to elucidate the pathogenesis of gallibacterium infections in chickens. ______________________________________________________________________ the aim of the present study was to compare the potential of bacterial cultivation (bc), pcr, in situ hybridisation (ish), and immunohistochemistry (ihc) in the diagnosis of haemophilus somnus, when applied to pneumonic bovine tissue. lungs from 65 field cases submitted for bacteriological examination were included in the study. the pcr-detection was performed on three different samples: plate-pcr (detection on plate washes after incubation of lung tissue on agar plates); swab-pcr (direct detection on a swab from the cut surface); and, whenever possible, a bronchus-pcr (direct detection on a swab from the main bronchus of the right cranial lung lobe). in order to examine the pathological significance of the findings, a histopathological examination of the cases was performed. h. somnus was detected by one or more techniques in 33 cases in total. by bc the bacterium was isolated from 10 cases, ihc and ish were positive in 17 and 19 cases, and plate- and swab-pcr were positive in 21 and 29 cases, respectively. the bronchus-pcr was positive in 30 out of 61 cases examined. the pcr-technique was the most sensitive method, and as this technique is fast and relatively inexpensive, it should be considered as a supplementary tool in the diagnosis of h. somnus induced calf pneumonia.
purpose to study the relationships between the refractive power of the crystalline lens, overall refractive error of the eye, and degree of nuclear cataract.   methods all phakic participants of the population-based central india eye and medical study with an age of 50+ years were included. calculation of the refractive lens power was based on distance noncycloplegic refractive error, corneal refractive power, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and axial length according to bennett's formula.   results the study included 1885 subjects. mean refractive lens power was 25.5 ± 3.0 d (range, 13.9-36.6). after adjustment for age and sex, the standardized correlation coefficients (β) of the association with the ocular refractive error were highest for crystalline lens power (β = -0.41; p < 0.001) and nuclear lens opacity grade (β = -0.42; p < 0.001), followed by axial length (β = -0.35; p < 0.001). they were lowest for corneal refractive power (β = -0.08; p = 0.001) and anterior chamber depth (β = -0.05; p = 0.04). in multivariate analysis, refractive error was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with shorter axial length (β = -1.26), lower refractive lens power (β = -0.95), lower corneal refractive power (β = -0.76), higher lens thickness (β = 0.30), deeper anterior chamber (β = 0.28), and less marked nuclear lens opacity (β = -0.05). lens thickness was significantly lower in eyes with greater nuclear opacity.   conclusions variations in refractive error in adults aged 50+ years were mostly influenced by variations in axial length and in crystalline lens refractive power, followed by variations in corneal refractive power, and, to a minor degree, by variations in lens thickness and anterior chamber depth. purpose to study the correlation between ocular refraction and the refractive components (corneal power, lens power and axial length) in a population-based sample of normal subjects.   methods we analysed the refractive and biometric findings for 723 right eyes (325 males and 398 females) comprising a population-based random sample of citizens 55 years and older participating in the reykjavik eye study. measurements of refraction, corneal curvature (by keratometry), anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and axial length (all by ultrasound biometry) were used to calculate crystalline lens power. the correlation and regression between refraction and ocular refractive components (corneal power, anterior chamber depth, lens power and axial length) were studied by distributional statistical methods.   results refraction (spherical equivalent) showed a significant negative correlation with axial length (r = -0.59, p < 0.0001), lens power (r = -0.26, p < 0.0001) and corneal power (r = -0.16, p < 0.0001). there were significant negative correlations between axial length and corneal power (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001) and between axial length and lens power (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001). based on multiple linear regression analysis, refraction could be correlated with corneal power, lens power and axial length in combination with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 (p < 0.0001).   conclusion this study confirms that ocular refraction is statistically significantly correlated with not only axial length but also lens power and (to a lesser extent) corneal power. the variation and correlations of crystalline lens power were considerable -- possibly indicating this component's modulatory effect on ocular refraction during growth. we conclude the refractive error of the eye to be a multifactorial condition involving a complex interplay between the cornea, the lens and the length of the eye.
objectives:in barrett's esophagus (be) normal squamous esophageal epithelium is replaced by specialized columnar epithelium (sce). be is related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) and is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. sce is detected also at normal-appearing esophagogastric junction without be (junctional sce). the relationships between junctional sce, gerd, and cardia adenocarcinoma are obscure and controversial. the aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence and demographics of junctional sce and to compare these figures with those reported for be, and esophageal and cardia adenocarcinoma. a further aim was to examine the association between junctional sce and gerd, helicobacter pylori infection, and gastritis.methods:one thousand one hundred-nineteen consecutive dyspeptic patients underwent gastroscopy and were enrolled into the study.results:junctional sce was detected in 110 patients (10%). the age-specific prevalence of junctional sce increased with age. the male:female ratio was 1:1.1. in multivariate analysis, junctional sce was independently and positively related to endoscopic erosive esophagitis (odds ratio [or], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1–3.1), cardia inflammation (carditis) (or, 3.1; 95% ci, 1.4–6.8), and age (or, 1.4 per decade; 95% ci, 1.2–1.6), but not to corpus h. pylori infection (or, 1.4; 95% ci, 0.7–2.8), antral (or, 1.0; 95% ci, 0.5–2.1) or corpus (or, 0.8; 95% ci, 0.4–1.8) gastritis, or intestinal metaplasia of the antral mucosa in stomach (or, 1.2; 95% ci, 0.7–2.1). in univariate analysis, junctional sce was, however, significantly more common in patients with antral-predominant atrophic gastritis (20%), compared with those with normal gastric histology (8%, p < 0.001).conclusions:junctional sce is age related and may therefore be an acquired lesion. it is associated with cardia inflammation and endoscopic erosive esophagitis, but not with h. pylori infection or gastric intestinal metaplasia. unlike be and cardia cancer, junctional sce occurs with similar frequency in men and women. background—the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and gastric cardia is increasing rapidly. barrett’s oesophagus is the major risk factor. intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction in the absence of barrett’s oesophagus is common but its relation to adenocarcinoma and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is unclear. aims—to study the prevalence and clinical, endoscopic, and histological associations of intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction. methods—biopsy specimens were taken from 120 randomly selected patients undergoing routine diagnostic endoscopy. eight biopsy specimens, taken from above and below the squamocolumnar junction, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum, were stained with haematoxylin/eosin, alcian blue/periodic acid-schiff, and gimenez, and graded independently by one pathologist. results—intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction was found in 21 patients (18%). metaplasia was associated with increasing age (p<0.01) and antral intestinal metaplasia (p=0.04). logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the only independent predictor (p<0.01). there was no association with symptomatic, endoscopic, or histological markers of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. conclusions—intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction is a common finding. it is associated with increasing age but not gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
objective: to determine whether elevated levels of troponin t are associated with altered lipid profile. methods: data were collected from 205 patients each of whom presented elevated troponin t levels. results: 195 patients presented with suspected myocardial infarction, 10 patients did not. of which 68 had medium, 107 high and 20 presented with very high troponin t levels. the proportions were significantly different (p = 0.000215). regression analysis showed that troponin t level was a useful quadratic predictor of total cholesterol (p = 0.000), triglycerides (p = 0.003), and low density cholesterol (p = 0.000); and a useful linear predictor of tc/hc ratio (p = 0.001). conclusions: the occurrence of myocardial infarction is associated with elevated troponin t levels; troponin t is positively correlated with total cholesterol, triglycerides, ldl and tc/hc ratio and negatively correlated with hdl. tc/hc ratio was not found to be a useful predictor of the likelihood of mi. objectives we sought to evaluate the significance of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) in the context of low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c).   background earlier studies support an inverse correlation between circulating hdl-c and coronary risk in patients with normal or elevated ldl-c.   methods this study involved 4,188 patients attending the palo alto veterans administration medical center or affiliated clinics with ldl-c levels below 60 mg/dl. outcomes were examined 1 year after the index ldl-c date. the combined primary end point was myocardial injury or hospitalization from ischemic heart disease. the secondary end point was all-cause mortality.   results mean hdl-c levels (mg/dl) by quartile (q) were: q1 28 mg/dl, q2 36 mg/dl, q3 43 mg/dl, and q4 63 mg/dl. the rate of myocardial injury or hospitalization for ischemic heart disease showed an inverse relationship to hdl-c (adjusted odds ratios: q1 1.59 [95% confidence interval (ci) 1.16 to 2.19], q2 1.39 [95% ci 1.01 to 1.92], q3 1.33 [95% ci 0.96 to 1.84], and q4 reference) that persisted regardless of statin use or recent myocardial injury. analyzing hdl-c as a continuous variable revealed a 10% [95% ci 3% to 17%] increase in the combined end point of myocardial injury or hospitalization for ischemic heart disease for every 10-mg/dl decrease in hdl-c. the unadjusted and adjusted incidence of all-cause mortality demonstrated a u-shaped relationship to hdl-c (adjusted odds ratios: q1 1.13 [95% ci 0.79 to 1.62], q2 0.97 [95% ci 0.67 to 1.40], q3 0.74 [95% ci 0.50 to 1.09], and q4 reference).   conclusions the inverse relationship between hdl-c and coronary risk persists even among patients with ldl-c below 60 mg/dl, although a u-shaped relationship is observed between hdl-c and all-cause mortality.
despite many studies reporting a variety of alterations in brain networks in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), alterations in hemispheric anatomical networks are still unclear. in this study, we investigated topology alterations in hemispheric white matter in patients with adhd and the relationship between these alterations and clinical features of the illness. weighted hemispheric brain anatomical networks were first constructed for each of 40 right-handed patients with adhd and 53 matched normal controls. then, graph theoretical approaches were utilized to compute hemispheric topological properties. the small-world property was preserved in the hemispheric network. furthermore, a significant group-by-hemisphere interaction was revealed in global efficiency, local efficiency and characteristic path length, attributed to the significantly reduced hemispheric asymmetry of global and local integration in patients with adhd compared with normal controls. specifically, reduced asymmetric regional efficiency was found in three regions. finally, we found that the abnormal asymmetry of hemispheric brain anatomical network topology and regional efficiency were both associated with clinical features (the adult adhd self-report scale and wechsler adult intelligence scale) in patients. our findings provide new insights into the lateralized nature of hemispheric dysconnectivity and highlight the potential for using brain network measures of hemispheric asymmetry as neural biomarkers for adhd and its clinical features. a growing body of work utilizing structural and functional brain imaging and neurocognitive measures of executive and attentional function indicates anomalous asymmetry in adhd. this study examined the white-matter volume and diffusion properties of frontostriatal tracts, as a function of hemisphere, in adhd and healthy controls. forty-three young males (21 adhd–combined type and 22 controls) aged 10–18 years underwent structural and diffusion weighted mri. tractography applying constrained spherical deconvolution (csd) was used to construct frontostriatal tracts between each of caudate and putamen and each of dorsolateral prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (dlpfc, vlpfc and ofc) in each hemisphere, to examine both volumetric and diffusion microstructure properties. young people with adhd did not show the right hemisphere lateralization of volume in the caudate-vlpfc and caudate-dlpfc tracts that was evident in controls, however the adhd group displayed a pronounced lateralization to the left for fractional anisotropy in the putamen-vlpfc tracts. the degree of volume asymmetry did not correlate with symptom severity; however fractional anisotropy (fa) values that were more strongly lateralized to the left in the putamen-vlpfc white matter were associated with greater symptom severity. adhd was associated with anomalous hemispheric asymmetries in both tract volume and underlying white-matter microstructure in major fibre tracts of the frontostriatal system. our observations of both weaker lateralization to the right in terms of tract volume and stronger lateralization to the left in terms of fa values for the adhd group, suggests that previous inconsistencies in the literature may reflect the influence of such asymmetries.
abstract this study aimed to evaluate the correlation between serum levels of il-17 and il-35 and the presence and severity of childhood asthma. the study was performed on 60 diagnosed asthmatic children, who were further classified into four groups according to the global initiative for asthma guidelines for asthma severity and control (gina) 2016, plus 30 age- and sex-matched apparently healthy children. all participants were subjected to full medical history, clinical examination, pulmonary function tests and laboratory evaluation in the form of complete blood count (cbc), serum total ige, il-17 and il-35 by elisa. our results revealed that eosinophils count, ige and il-17 were significantly higher in the asthmatic group than the control group (p < .001), while il-35 levels were significantly lower in asthmatics than control (p < .001). a strong negative correlation was found between serum il-17 and serum il-35; a positive correlation was found between serum il-17 and both of serum total ige and eosinophils counts in atopic asthmatic patients, and serum il-35 showed significant negative correlations with both. roc analysis of the data showed that the cut-off value of il-35 level was <189.5 pg/ml and for il-17 level, it was >13.1 pg/ml; this value could predict childhood asthma with sensitivity of 81.7% and 83.3%, and specificity of 76.7% and 70%, respectively. a combination of both cytokines yielded an increase in sensitivity to 95%. in conclusion, in the current study, il-17 is upregulated while il-35 is downregulated in childhood asthma with a significant negative correlation between both. these results suggest that both may play an important role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. abstract objective: allergic asthma is a chronic airway inflammation resulting from an imbalance of t helper (th) cell responses to allergens. interleukin (il)-35 has been shown to have potent immunoregulatory properties. whether il-35 participates in the immunopathogenesis of allergic asthma patients is still unknown. methods: cd4+ t cells and cd4+cd25− t cells were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) using magnetic separation. the concentration of il-35 in plasma was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the mrna expression levels of the il-35 subunits, ebi3 and il-12p35, were detected by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). the proliferative responses of cfse-labeled cd4+cd25− t cells in the presence or absence of rhil-35 were evaluated by flow cytometry. cytokine production of activated cd4+cd25− t cells was examined by flow cytometry and elisa. results: il-35 protein and mrna levels were decreased in allergic asthmatics. the frequencies of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs and cd4+il-12p35+ t cells in allergic asthma patients were lower than in healthy controls. moreover, the addition of rhil-35 suppressed cfse+cd4+cd25− t cell proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, and the suppression induced by rhil-35 was associated with decreases in il-4 but not ifn-γ and il-17 production of activated cd4+cd25− t cells. the increased level of th1/th2 was observed in allergic asthmatics in the presence of rhil-35. conclusions: our data suggest that il-35 can effectively suppress the proliferation and il-4 production of activated cd4+cd25− t cells in allergic asthma, and that il-35 may be a new immunotherapy for asthma patients.
this paper contributes to the literature on both embodied technical progress and firm dynamics, by formulating an endogenous growth model where selection and imitation play a fundamental role in helping capital good producers to learn about the productivity of technologies embodied in new machines. by calibrating the model to some key aggregates particularly relevant for the embodied capital literature, among them the growth rate of the relative price of investment, the model quantitatively replicates the main facts associated to firm dynamics, such as the entry rate and the tail index of the establishment size distribution. in line with the previous literature, it also predicts a contribution to productivity growth of embodied technical progress and selection of around 60%. jel codes: b52, o3, o41 ∗we thank paolo giordani, bart hobijn, thanh le, pietro peretto, morten ravn, roberto samaniego, paul segerstrom, and seminar participants at the european university institute, the swiss federal institute of technology zurich, iza bonn, and the sed, eea, asset, and iss conferences for helpful comments and suggestions. a previous version of this paper has circulated under the name “growth through selection under rational expectations.” the authors acknowledge the financial support of the ec, contract hprn-ct-2002-00237. omar licandro also acknowledges support from the spanish ministry of education under projects sej2004-0459/econ and sej2007-65552, and the spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness, through the severo ochoa programme for centres of excellence in r&d (sev-2011-0075). †swiss national bank. ‡iae-csic and barcelona gse. this paper describes an analytically tractable model of balanced growth that is consistent with the observed size distribution of firms. growth is the result of idiosyncratic firm productivity improvements, selection of successful firms, and imitation by entrants. selection tends to improve aggregate productivity at a fast rate if entry and imitation are easy. the empirical phenomenon of zipf's law can be interpreted to mean that entry costs are high or that imitation is difficult, or both. the small size of entrants indicates that imitation must be difficult. a calibration based on u. s. data suggests that about half of output growth can be attributed to selection. but the implied variance of the combined preference and technology shocks is puzzlingly high.
in two visuospatial working memory (vswm) span experiments, older and young participants were tested under conditions of either high or low interference, using two different displays: computerized versions of a 3 x 3 matrix or the standard (randomly arrayed) corsi block task (p. m. corsi, 1972). older adults' vswm estimates were increased in the low-interference, compared with the high-interference, condition, replicating findings with verbal memory span studies. young adults showed the opposite pattern, and together the findings suggest that typical vswm span tasks include opposing components (interference and practice) that differentially affect young and older adults. in two experiments, we investigated the possibility that susceptibility to proactive interference (pi) affects performance on memory span measures. we tested both younger and older adults (older adults were tested because of the suggestion that they are differentially susceptible to pi). we used two different span measures and manipulated testing procedures to reduce pi for these tasks. for older adults, span estimates increased with each pi-reducing manipulation; for younger adults, scores increased when multiple pi manipulations were combined or when pi-reducing manipulations were used in paradigms in which within-task pi was especially high. the findings suggest that pi critically influences span performance. we consider the possibility that interference-proneness may influence cognitive behaviors previously thought to be governed by capacity.
background exposure to the chemotherapeutic alkylating agent thiotepa during brain development leads to neurological complications arising from neurodegeneration and irreversible damage to the developing central nerve system (cns). administration of single dose of thiotepa in 7-d postnatal (p7) rat triggers activation of apoptotic cascade and widespread neuronal death. the present study was aimed to elucidate whether nicotinamide may prevent thiotepa-induced neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain. methodology/principal findings neuronal cell death induced by thiotepa was associated with the induction of bax, release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp-1). post-treatment of developing rats with nicotinamide suppressed thiotepa-induced upregulation of bax, reduced cytochrome-c release into the cytosol and reduced expression of activated caspase-3 and cleavage of parp-1. cresyl violet staining showed numerous dead cells in the cortex hippocampus and thalamus; post-treatment with nicotinamide reduced the number of dead cells in these brain regions. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (tdt)-mediated dutp nick end-labeling (tunel) and immunohistochemical analysis of caspase-3 show that thiotepa-induced cell death is apoptotic and that it is inhibited by nicotinamide treatment. conclusion nicotinamide (nic) treatment with thiotepa significantly improved neuronal survival and alleviated neuronal cell death in the developing rat. these data demonstrate that nicotinamide shows promise as a therapeutic and neuroprotective agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in newborns and infants. nicotinamide (nam) blocks n-methyl-n-nitrosourea (mnu)-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis in rats, though the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. activation of the nuclear enzyme poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) in response to dna damage plays a pivotal role in apoptosis. thus, the role of nam in the regulation of parp and jun n-terminal kinase (jnk)/activator protein-1 (ap-1) was investigated by western blot analyses. during 7 days after the intraperitoneal injection of mnu (60 mg/kg), rat retinas exhibited dna fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis and activation of parp, phosphorylation of jnk and c-jun, induction of ap-1 (c-jun and c-fos) and bax, as well as photoreceptor cell loss. however, when nam (1000 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was given immediately after mnu, it was found that parp activation was diminished, the phosphorylation of jnk and c-jun was suppressed, and the induction of c-jun, c-fos and bax was suppressed. this resulted in the retinal structure being protected. therefore, nam blocked mnu-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis by inhibiting both parp activity and the jnk/ap-1 signalling pathway.
objectives this study aims to assess the attitudes, knowledge, preparedness, and willingness of dentists and dental students to treat people-living-with-hiv/aids (plwha) in china, and to determine the factors associated with willingness to treat.   methods we surveyed dentists and dental students in hospitals and dental schools in five regions in china with varying plwha prevalence. survey questions covered demographics, as well as four categories regarding treating plwha: knowledge (scaled 0-1), attitude (scaled 1-4), preparedness (scaled 1-4), and willingness to treat (scaled 1-4). composite scores for each category were calculated as weighted means. confounder-adjusted regression analysis was performed to determine the factor(s) correlated with willingness to treat.   results we collected 394 (84 percent) and 462 (90 percent) useable surveys from dentists and dental students respectively. dentists' mean composite scores were 0.63 (poor knowledge), 2.1 (negative attitude), 2.8 (adequate preparedness), and 2.5 (neutral willingness). students' mean composite scores were 0.64 (poor knowledge), 2.3 (negative attitude), 2.7 (adequate preparedness), and 2.6 (positive willingness). forty-five percent of dentists and 59 percent of dental students had scores indicating positive willingness to treat. attitude was the only factor consistently correlated with willingness to treat. dentists and dental students scored low in all categories except for preparedness.   conclusion it is imperative that knowledge of hiv/aids and attitudes toward plwha be further improved during dental training to increase the access to and effectiveness of dental care of plwha in china and to enhance their quality of life. the hiv and aids have emerged as complex health threats to the world population. as future dentists, it is pertinent that the dental students have sufficient knowledge and a positive approach towards the disease. accordingly, the aim of this study was to assess the hiv/aids related knowledge and attitudes amongst clinical dental students at kuwait university. a cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst the clinical dental students using a structured questionnaire with 60 questions to examine their knowledge under various categories and 13 questions to examine their attitudes towards the disease. the survey revealed that almost 58% of the respondents demonstrated a high level of knowledge (mean score: 45.23 ± 4.35 sd). majority of the students (63.6%) expressed negative attitude (mean score: 5.36 ± 2.56 sd). the mean knowledge score of the fifth year dental students was significantly higher (p = 0.022) than that of the final year dental students regarding the knowledge of virus and disease process. however, no significant difference was observed with respect to other knowledge categories. despite their high level of knowledge, the majority displayed a negative attitude towards hiv/aids. hence, the findings imply that there is a need to address, more clearly, the students' misconceptions and attitudes towards the disease.
background the 13c-caffeine breath test (cbt) is a non-invasive, quantitative test of liver function which has been shown to correlate inversely to the child-pugh score. the aim of the study was to determine the utility of cbt in the assessment of cirrhosis and its correlation to the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score. methods thirty-nine patients, 29 with cirrhosis and 10 with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis, and 8 healthy volunteers were included. cirrhotic patients were graded according to child-pugh and meld scores. all participants underwent cbt and laboratory tests on the same day. the results of the cbt were expressed as percentages of changes over baseline values (δ‰) per 100 mg caffeine. results the mean single 15-min, 30-min, 45-min and 1-h cbt results, as well as cumulative cbt values differed significantly between healthy controls or chronic liver disease patients and cirrhotics (1-h cbt: 3.22±1.06 or 3.56±2.80 vs. 1.69±2.52, p≤0.01). in contrast, the cbt results at any time point or cumulative values did not correlate with meld or child-pugh scores. receiver operating characteristics (roc) analysis showed that the 30-min cbt values were more accurate in differentiating cirrhotics from chronic liver disease patients (area under roc curve: 0.871). conclusions cbt can reliably differentiate the patients with decompensated cirrhosis from non-cirrhotic patients with chronic liver diseases. however, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, cbt results do not seem to be associated with the child-pugh and meld scores. the properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. the aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (cbt) using orally administered 13c‐caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. the cbt was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis b or c; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the cbt in a cohort of these subjects. over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the cbt exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, p < .001). cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced cbt values (1.15 ± 0.75 δ‰ mg−1) compared with controls (2.23 ± 0.76; p = .001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 ± 1.05; p = .04). there was a significant inverse relationship between the cbt and child‐pugh score (r = −.74, p = .002). the intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated cbts in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. although smoking was associated with an 86% to 141% increase in cbt in all groups, the cbt was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 ± 0.82, 3.63 ± 1.21, and 2.14 ± 1.14, respectively, p = .001). multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (p < .001) and disease state (p = .001) were significant predictors of the cbt. in conclusion, the 13c‐cbt represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.
there is no consensus in literature regarding the best plan for prosthetic rehabilitation with partial multiple adjacent implants to minimize stress generated in the bone-implant interface. the aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical behavior of cemented fixed partial dentures, splinted and nonsplinted, on morse taper implants and with different types of coating material (ceramic and resin), using photoelastic stress analysis. a photoelastic model of an interposed edentulous space, missing a second premolar and a first molar, and rehabilitated with 4 different types of cemented crowns and supported by 2 adjacent implants was used. groups were as follows: uc, splinted ceramic crowns; ic, nonsplinted ceramic crowns; ur, splinted resin crowns; and ir, nonsplinted resin crowns. different vertical static loading conditions were performed: balanced occlusal load, 10 kgf; simultaneous punctiform load on the implanted premolar and molar, 10 kgf; and alternate punctiform load on the implanted premolar and molar, 5 kgf. changes in stress distribution were analyzed in a polariscope, and digital photographs were taken of each condition to allow comparison of stress pattern distribution around the implants. cementation of the fixed partial dentures generated stresses between implants. splinted restorations distributed the stresses more evenly between the implants than nonsplinted when force was applied. ceramic restorations presented better distribution of stresses than resin restorations. based on the results obtained, it was concluded that splinted ceramic restorations promote better stress distribution around osseointegrated implants when compared with nonsplinted crowns; metal-ceramic restorations present less stress concentration and magnitude than metal-plastic restorations. statement of problem to circumvent the difficulty of achieving a passive framework fit, some authors have suggested that multiple adjacent implants be restored individually. this protocol requires that each unit be able to withstand mastication forces. non-splinted restorations have numerous interproximal contacts that require adjustments prior to placement, with an unknown outcome relative to load transfer.   purpose this in vitro simulation study examined the effect of splinting and interproximal contact tightness on passivity of fit and the load transfer characteristics of implant restorations.   material and methods a photoelastic model of a human partially edentulous left mandible with 3 screw-type implants (3.75 x 10 mm) was fabricated. for non-splinted restorations, individual crowns were fabricated on 3 custom-milled titanium abutments. after the units were cemented, 5 levels of interproximal contact tightness were evaluated: open, ideal (8 microm shim stock drags without tearing), light (ideal +10 microm), medium (ideal + 50 microm), and heavy (ideal + 90 microm). for splinted restorations, five 3-unit fixed partial dentures were fabricated, internally adjusted with silicone disclosing material, and cemented to the model. changes in stress distribution under simulated non-loaded and loaded conditions (6.8 kg) were analyzed with a polariscope.   results in the simulated alveolar structures, non-splinted restorations with heavier interproximal contacts were associated with increased tensile stresses between implants; occlusal loads tended to concentrate around the specific loaded implant. splinted restorations shared the occlusal loads and distributed the stresses more evenly between the implants when force was applied. the load-sharing effect was most evident on the center implant but also was seen on the terminal abutments of the splinted restorations.   conclusion the results of this in vitro study suggest that excessive contact tightness between individual crowns can lead to a non-passive situation. in this experiment, splinted restorations exhibited better load sharing than non-splinted restorations.
the cuckoo search algorithm is a simple and effective global optimization algorithm. it has been successfully applied to solve a wide range of real-world optimization problem. in this paper, we use a new search strategy based on orthogonal learning strategy to enhance the exploitation ability of the basic cuckoo search algorithm. in order to verify the performance of our approach, 23 benchmark functions are employed. experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better than or at least comparable to state-of-the-art approaches from literature when considering the quality of the solution obtained. this paper presents a variant of particle swarm optimizers (psos) that we call the comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (clpso), which uses a novel learning strategy whereby all other particles' historical best information is used to update a particle's velocity. this strategy enables the diversity of the swarm to be preserved to discourage premature convergence. experiments were conducted (using codes available from http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/epnsugan) on multimodal test functions such as rosenbrock, griewank, rastrigin, ackley, and schwefel and composition functions both with and without coordinate rotation. the results demonstrate good performance of the clpso in solving multimodal problems when compared with eight other recent variants of the pso.
perisomatic gabaergic synapses onto hippocampal pyramidal cells arise from two populations of basket cells with different neurochemical and functional properties. the presence of the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex in their postsynaptic density (psd) distinguishes perisomatic synapses from gabaergic synapses on dendrites and the axon-initial segment. targeted deletion of neuroligin 2 (nl2), a transmembrane protein interacting with presynaptic neurexin, has been reported to disrupt postsynaptic clustering of gabaa receptors (gabaar) and their anchoring protein, gephyrin, at perisomatic synapses. in contrast, targeted deletion of gabra2 disrupts perisomatic clustering of gephyrin, but not of α1-gabaar, nl2, or dystrophin/dystroglycan. unexpectedly, conditional deletion of dag1, encoding dystroglycan, selectively prevents the formation of perisomatic gabaergic synapses from basket cells expressing cholecystokinin. collectively, these observations suggest that multiple mechanisms regulate formation and molecular composition of the gabaergic psd at perisomatic synapses. here, we further explored this issue by investigating the effect of targeted deletion of gabra1 and nl2 on the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex and on perisomatic synapse formation, using immunofluorescence analysis with a battery of gabaergic pre- and postsynaptic markers. we show that the absence of α1-gabaar increases gabaergic synapses containing the α2 subunit, without affecting the clustering of dystrophin and nl2; in contrast, the absence of nl2 produces highly variable effects postsynaptically, not restricted to perisomatic synapses and being more severe for the gabaar subunits and gephyrin than dystrophin. altogether, the results confirm the importance of nl2 as organizer of the gabaergic psd and unravel distinct roles for α1- and α2-gabaars in the formation of gabaergic circuits in close interaction with the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex. synaptic scaffolding molecule (s‐scam) is a synaptic protein, which harbors five or six psd‐95/discs large/zo‐1 (pdz), a guanylate kinase and two ww domains. it interacts with nmda receptor subunits, neuroligin and β‐catenin, and is involved in the accumulation of neuroligin at excitatory synapses. in this study, we have demonstrated s‐scam is localized at inhibitory synapses in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons. we have identified β‐dystroglycan (β‐dg) as a binding partner for s‐scam at inhibitory synapses. ww domains of s‐scam bind to three sequences of β‐dg. we have also revealed that s‐scam can interact with neuroligin 2, which is known to be exclusively localized at inhibitory synapses. the ww domains and the second pdz domain of s‐scam are involved in the interaction with neuroligin 2. β‐dg, neuroligin 2 and s‐scam form a tripartite complex in vitro. neuroligin 2 is detected in the immunoprecipitates by anti‐β‐dg antibody from rat brain. s‐scam, β‐dg and neuroligin 2 are partially co‐localized in rat hippocampal neurons. these data suggest that s‐scam is associated with β‐dg and neuroligin 2 at inhibitory synapses, and functions as a linker between the dystrophin glycoprotein complex and the neurexin–neuroligin complex.
body mass index (bmi) is often used as a surrogate estimate of percent body fat in epidemiological studies. this study tested the hypothesis that bmi is representative of body fatness independent of age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic location in prepubertal children. the study sample included a total of 605 prepubertal children (275 girls and 330 boys) of which 247 were chinese from jinan, shandong, mainland china, and 358 children were from various ethnic backgrounds in new york city (nyc): 121 caucasians, 94 african americans, and 143 asians (chinese and korean). in this cross-sectional study, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to quantify total body fat (tbf) and percent body fat (pbf). prepubertal status was assessed by the criteria of tanner. multiple regression models were developed with tbf and pbf as the dependent variables and bmi, age, sex, and ethnicity as independent variables. multiple regression analysis showed that bmi alone explained 85% and 69% of between-subject variance for tbf and pbf, respectively. sex was a significant contributor to the models (p<0.001) with girls having higher tbf and pbf than boys. ethnicity and geographic location were significant contributors to the model (p<0.0001) with asians (jinan and nyc asians) having higher pbf than all non-asian groups (p<0.0001), and jinan asians having higher tbf and pbf than nyc-asians. among prepubertal children, for the same bmi, asians have significantly higher pbf compared with african americans and caucasians. caution is warranted when applying bmi across sex and ethnic prepubertal groups. objectives to test the hypothesis that in a healthy pediatric population body mass index (bmi) (kilograms per meter square) is a valid measure of fatness that is independent of age for both sexes.   methods total body fat (tbf) (in kilograms) and percent of body weight as fat (pbf) were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) in 198 healthy italian children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age. we developed multiple regression analysis models with tbf and percent body fat as dependent variables and bmi, age, and interaction terms as independent variables. separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls.   results bmi was strongly associated with tbf (r2 = 0.85 and 0.89 for boys and girls, respectively) and pbf (r2 =0.63 and 0.69 for boys and girls, respectively). confidence limits on bmi-fatness association were wide, with individuals of similar bmi showing large differences in tbf and in pbf. age was a significant covariate in all regression models. addition of nonlinear terms for bmi did not substantially increase the r2 for tbf and pbf models in boys and girls.   conclusion our results support the use of bmi as a fatness measure in groups of children and adolescents, although interpretation should be cautious when comparing bmi across groups that differ in age or when predicting a specific individual's tbf or pbf.
background inadequate hepcidin production leads to iron overload in nearly all types of hemochromatosis. we explored the acute response of hepcidin to iron challenge in 25 patients with hfe-hemochromatosis, in two with tfr2-hemochromatosis and in 13 controls. sixteen patients (10 c282y/c282y homozygotes, 6 c282y/h63d compound heterozygotes) had increased iron stores, while nine (6 c282y/c282y homozygotes, 3 c282y/h63d compound heterozygotes) were studied after phlebotomy-induced normalization of iron stores. design and methods we analyzed serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum hepcidin by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and mass-spectrometry at baseline, and 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after a single 65-mg dose of oral iron. results serum iron and transferrin saturation significantly increased at 4 hours and returned to baseline values at 8–12 hours in all groups, except in the iron-normalized patients who showed the highest and longest increase of both parameters. the level of hepcidin increased significantly at 4 hours and returned to baseline at 24 hours in controls and in the c282y/h63d compound heterozygotes at diagnosis. the hepcidin response was smaller in c282y-homozygotes than in controls, barely detectable in the patients with iron-depleted hfe-hemochromatosis and absent in those with tfr2-hemochromatosis. conclusions our results are consistent with a scenario in which tfr2 plays a prominent and hfe a contributory role in the hepcidin response to a dose of oral iron. in iron-normalized patients with hfe hemochromatosis, both the low baseline hepcidin level and the weak response to iron contribute to hyperabsorption of iron. assays for the detection of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin in plasma or urine have not yet been widely available, whereas quantitative comparisons between hepcidin levels in these different matrices were thus far even impossible due to technical restrictions. to circumvent these limitations, we here describe several advances in time-of flight mass spectrometry (tof ms), the most important of which concerned spiking of a synthetic hepcidin analogue as internal standard into serum and urine samples. this serves both as a control for experimental variation, such as recovery and matrix-dependent ionization and ion suppression, and at the same time allows value assignment to the measured hepcidin peak intensities. the assay improvements were clinically evaluated using samples from various patients groups and its relevance was further underscored by the significant correlation of serum hepcidin levels with serum iron indices in healthy individuals. most importantly, this approach allowed kinetic studies as illustrated by the paired analyses of serum and urine samples, showing that more than 97% of the freely filtered serum hepcidin can be reabsorbed in the kidney. thus, the here reported advances in tof ms-based hepcidin measurements represent critical steps in the accurate quantification of hepcidin in various body fluids and pave the way for clinical studies on the kinetic behavior of hepcidin in both healthy and diseased states.
is orienting of spatial attention dependent on normal functioning of the ocular motor system? we investigated the role of motor pathways in covert orienting (attentional orienting without performing eye movements) by studying three patients suffering from duane retraction syndrome-a congenital impairment in executing horizontal eye movements restricted to specific gaze directions. patients showed a typical exogenous (reflexive) attention effect when the target was presented in visual fields to which they could perform an eye movement. this effect was not present when the target was presented in the visual field to which they could not perform eye movements. these findings stress the link between eye movements and attention. specifically, they bring out the importance of the ability to execute appropriate eye movements for attentional orienting. we suggest that the relevant information about eye movement ability is provided by feedback from lower motor structures to higher attentional areas. shifts of attention can be made overtly by moving the eyes or covertly with attention being allocated to a region of space that does not correspond to the current direction of gaze. however, the precise relationship between eye movements and the covert orienting of attention remains controversial. the influential premotor theory proposes that the covert orienting of attention is produced by the programming of (unexecuted) eye movements and thus predicts a strong relationship between the ability to execute eye movements and the operation of spatial attention. here, we demonstrate for the first time that impaired spatial attention is observed in an individual (ai) who is neurologically healthy but who cannot execute eye movements as a result of a congenital impairment in the elasticity of her eye muscles. this finding provides direct support for the role of the eye-movement system in the covert orienting of attention and suggests that whereas intact cortical structures may be necessary for normal attentional reflexes, they are not sufficient. the ability to move our eyes is essential for the development of normal patterns of spatial attention.
micrornas (mirna, mir) play an important role in cancer cell growth and migration; however, the potential roles of mirnas in osteosarcoma remain largely uncharacterized. by applying a mirna microarray platform and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, we found that several mirnas have altered expression levels in osteosarcoma cell lines and tumor tissues when compared with normal human osteoblasts. three mirnas, mir-199a-3p, mir-127-3p, and mir-376c, were significantly decreased in osteosarcoma cell lines, whereas mir-151-3p and mir-191 were increased in osteosarcoma cell lines in comparison with osteoblasts. transfection of precursor mir-199a-3p into osteosarcoma cell lines significantly decreased cell growth and migration, thus indicating that the inhibition effect is associated with an increase in the g1-phase and a decrease of the s-phase cell population. in addition, we observed decreased mtor and stat3 expression in mir-199a-3p transfected cells. this study provides new insights for mirnas in osteosarcoma and suggests that mir-199a-3p may play a functional role in osteosarcoma cell growth and proliferation. restoring mir-199a-3p's function may provide therapeutic benefits in osteosarcoma. mol cancer ther; 10(8); 1337–45. ©2011 aacr. micrornas (mirna) have rapidly emerged as modulators of gene expression in cancer in which they may have great diagnostic and therapeutic import. microrna-199a-3p (mir-199a-3p) is downregulated in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). here, we show that mir-199a-3p targets mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) and c-met in hcc cells. restoring attenuated levels of mir-199a-3p in hcc cells led to g(1)-phase cell cycle arrest, reduced invasive capability, enhanced susceptibility to hypoxia, and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. these in vitro findings were confirmed by an analysis of human hcc tissues, which revealed an inverse correlation linking mir-199a-3p and mtor as well as a shorter time to recurrence after hcc resection in patients with lower mir-199a-3p expression. these results suggest that tactics to regulate mtor and c-met by elevating levels of mir-199a-3p may have therapeutic benefits in highly lethal cancers such as hcc.
ca2+-permeable ampa receptors may play a key role during developmental neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and neuronal loss in a number of neuropathologies. however, the intracellular signaling pathways used by ampa receptors during such processes are not fully understood. the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade is an attractive target because it has been shown to be involved in gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal stress. using primary cultures of mouse striatal neurons and a phosphospecific mapk antibody we addressed whether ampa receptors can activate the mapk cascade. we found that in the presence of cyclothiazide, ampa caused a robust and direct (no involvement of nmda receptors or l-type voltage-sensitive ca2+ channels) ca2+-dependent activation of mapk through mapk kinase (mek). this activation was blocked by gyki 53655, a noncompetitive selective antagonist of ampa receptors. probing the mechanism of this activation revealed an essential role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase) and the involvement of a pertussis toxin (ptx)-sensitive g-protein, a src family protein tyrosine kinase, and ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase ii. similarly, kainate activated mapk in a pi 3-kinase-dependent manner. ampa receptor-evoked neuronal death and arachidonic acid mobilization did not appear to involve signaling through the mapk pathway. however, ampa receptor stimulation led to a ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor creb, which could be prevented by inhibitors of mek or pi 3-kinase. our results indicate that ca2+-permeable ampa receptors transduce signals from the cell surface to the nucleus of neurons through a pi 3-kinase-dependent activation of mapk. this novel pathway may play a pivotal role in regulating synaptic plasticity in the striatum. through voltage-dependent ion channels activates ras/ mapk. subsequently, four ca1-dependent pathways p21 (ras) is a small guanine nucleotide–binding proto ras have been described; however, the functional tein that functions in signal transduction cascades that independence of the pathways is unclear, since cross– mediate cellular growth and differentiation. ras is highly talk between different pathways probably occurs (figure expressed in the developing and adult nervous systems 1). one ca1-dependent pathway to ras involves the and plays an important role mediating growth factor tyrosine kinase pyk2 (lev et al., 1995). attempts to idenresponses. nearly 2 years ago, it was shown that volttify a function for pyk2 revealed that increases in cytoage-gated ca1 influx can also activate ras. since plasmic ca increased pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation growth factor and ca1 signaling cascades were beand kinase activity. overexpression of pyk2 proportionlieved to be distinct, the mechanisms by which ca ally increases phosphorylation and activation of mapk, activated ras were expected to be novel. until recently, suggesting that pyk2 may activate ras. one answer to these mechanisms have remained a mystery. however, how pyk2 might activate ras comes from analysis of several recent papers provided evidence for no less than a structurally homologous protein, the focal adhesion four ca-dependent pathways that lead to ras. these kinase (p125 or fak). fak is a tyrosine kinase that pathways may play critical roles linking activity-induced mediates signaling by the integrin family of extracellular changes in cytoplasmic ca levels and long-term matrix receptors. one model posits that fak autophochanges in neuronal differentiation, survival, and synapsphorylation and activation results when the cytotic strength. apparent differences in the subcellular loplasmic domains of activated integrin receptors cluster. calization of certain ca-dependent paths to ras sugfak autophosphorylation at tyrosine (y397) enables gest that they may play distinct roles in preand fak to bind avidly the sh2 domain of the tyrosine kinase postsynaptic plasticity mechanisms. the existence of src. the interaction between fak and src may induce multiple pathways could also be important for generata conformational change that activates src. src then ing specific ca21 responses and for integrating the activphosphorylates fak on a specific tyrosine (y925) that ity of ca1-independent signaling pathways. serves as a binding site for grb2. thus, activated fak the ras/mapk cascade may localize the grb2–sos complex to the inner surface four genes comprise the mammalian ras family: ki-ras, of the plasma membrane where it can activate ras. h-ras, n-ras, and r-ras. these genes encode small guasince fak and pyk2 are structurally homologous and nine nucleotide–binding proteins that localize to the inthe fak tyrosine residues y397 and y925 are conserved ner face of the plasma membrane and function as moin pyk2, it seems likely that pyk2 also activates ras lecular switches that transmit receptor signals to by a src-dependent mechanism. support for this model downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) comes from a recent study by halegoua and colleagues cascades (seger and krebs, 1995;

unlabelled ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor, is a prodrug which is rapidly hydrolysed after absorption to the active metabolite ramiprilat. earlier trials have shown that ace inhibitors, when given to patients with low ejection fractions, have reduced the relative risk of myocardial infarction (mi) and other ischaemic events by 14 to 23%. subsequently, the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre heart outcomes prevention evaluation (hope) study has shown that, in patients who are not known to have low ejection fraction or heart failure but are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular events, ramipril reduced the incidence of stroke, mi and death due to cardiovascular disease. results from the hope study, in which 9297 patients were randomised to receive either ramipril 10 mg/day or placebo for a mean of 4.5 years, indicate that ramipril reduced the relative risk of the composite outcome of mi, stroke and cardiovascular death by 22%. the incidence of the composite outcome was significantly lower in the ramipril group than in the placebo group (14.0 vs 17.8%). patients who received ramipril, compared with placebo recipients, had a significantly decreased incidence of stroke, mi or death due to cardiovascular disease (3.4 vs 4.9%, 9.9 vs 12.3% and 6.1 vs 8.1%, respectively). the relative risk of death from any cause was reduced among patients who received ramipril. in addition, treatment with ramipril reduced as the incidence of revascularisation procedures, and, among patients with diabetes mellitus, ramipril reduced the incidence of complications related to diabetes mellitus, including the development of overt nephropathy. moreover, in patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, ramipril, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the development of diabetes mellitus. furthermore, compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving ramipril had a reduced rate of progression of carotid artery wall thickness.   conclusion ramipril 10 mg/day can significantly reduce the incidence of mi, stroke or death from cardiovascular causes in patients aged > or =55 years who are at increased risk for the development of ischaemic cardiovascular events due to a history of stroke, coronary artery disease (with controlled blood pressure), diabetes mellitus plus at least one other risk factor or peripheral vascular disease but no heart failure or low ejection fraction. therefore, in addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications, ramipril should be an integral part of secondary prevention therapy in patients at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular events. background—in trials of patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure, ace inhibitor use was unexpectedly associated with reduced myocardial infarction (mi). using the heart outcomes prevention evaluation (hope) trial data, we tested prospectively whether ramipril, an ace inhibitor, could reduce coronary events and revascularization procedures among patients with normal left ventricular function. methods and results—in the hope trial, 9297 high-risk men and women, ≥55 years of age with previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes plus 1 risk factor, were randomly assigned to ramipril (up to 10 mg/d), vitamin e (400 iu/d), their combination, or matching placebos. during the mean follow-up of 4.5 years, there were 482 (10.4%) patients with clinical mi and unexpected cardiovascular death in the ramipril group compared with 604 (12.9%) in the placebo group [relative risk reduction (rrr), 21% (95% ci) (11,30);p <0.0003]. ramipril was associated with a trend toward less fatal mi and unexpected death [4.0% versus 4.7%; rrr, 16% (−3, 31)] and with a significant reduction in nonfatal mi [5.6% versus 7.2%; rrr, 23% (9,34)]. risk reductions in mi were documented in participants taking or not taking &bgr;-blockers, lipid lowering, and/or antiplatelet agents. although ramipril had no impact on hospitalizations for unstable angina [11.9% versus 12.2%; rrr, 3% (−9,14)], it reduced the risk of worsening and new angina [27.2% versus 30.0%; rrr, 12% (5,18);p <0.0014] and coronary revascularizations [12.5% versus 14.8%; rrr, 18%; (8,26) p <0.0005]. conclusions—in this high-risk cohort, ramipril reduced the risk of mi, worsening and new angina, and the occurrence of coronary revascularizations.
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (ahrr) is a new member of bhlh-pas proteins which is important in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. the ahrr shares structural similarities with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) and ahr nuclear translocator (arnt). the ahrr is thought to be involved in transcriptional control of ahr-regulated genes by sequestering arnt. most of the knowledge of regulation and function of the ahrr is from studies in cell lines. here, we report the tissue distribution of ahrr in ahr deficient and wild type c57bl/6 mice. in addition, the inducibility of the ahrr and cytochrome p450 (cyp) 1a1 in response to benzo(a)pyrene (b(a)p) (10 mg/kg bw i.p.) was investigated. the results show that the ahrr mrna expression pattern in untreated c57bl/6 mice varies across tissues with high levels in hearts and brains. in other tissues, ahrr mrna expression was low. in contrast to wild-type animals, the tissue levels in ahr−/− mice were about two to three orders of magnitude lower. treatment of wild-type animals with b(a)p resulted in an induced ahrr expression in liver, spleen, lung and ovary. no significant induction of ahrr mrna was found in brain and heart tissues, which have a constitutively high level of ahrr expression. simultaneous measurements of cyp1a1 and ahrr mrna expression do not strongly support the view that the ahrr tissue pattern triggers the tissue specific responsiveness of ahr-regulated genes to b(a)p treatment. the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (ahrr) is a negative regulator of ah receptor (ahr), which mediates most of the toxic and biochemical effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd). ahr has been shown to be the major reason for the exceptionally wide (ca. 1000-fold) sensitivity difference in acute toxicity of tcdd between two rat strains, sensitive long-evans (turku/ab) (l-e) and resistant han/wistar (kuopio) (h/w), but there is another, currently unknown contributing factor involved. in the present study, we examined ahrr structure and expression in these rat strains to find out whether ahrr could be this auxiliary factor. molecular cloning of ahrr coding region showed that consistent with ahrr proteins in other species, the n-terminal end of rat ahrr is highly conserved, but pas b and q-rich domains are severely truncated or lacking. identical structures were recorded in both strains. next, the time-, dose-, and tissue-dependent expression of ahrr was determined using quantitative real-time rt-pcr. in liver, ahrr expression was very low in untreated rats, but it increased rapidly after tcdd exposure (100microg/kg). testis exhibited the highest constitutive expression of ahrr, whereas kidney, spleen, and heart showed the highest induction of ahrr in response to tcdd treatment. again, no marked differences were found between h/w and l-e rats, implying that ahrr is not the auxiliary contributing factor to the strain difference in tcdd sensitivity. however, simultaneous measurement of cyp1a1 mrna reinforced the view that ahrr is an important determinant of tissue-specific responsiveness to tcdd.
to evaluate the effectiveness of screening using visual inspection with acetic acid (via). objective to investigate the value of acetic acid visualization of the cervix as an alternative to cytologic screening. methods a prospective study was conducted in a squatter area in cape town, south africa, on 2426 women who underwent speculum examination, naked-eye inspection of the cervix after application of acetic acid, and cytologic smear. the smears were stained and processed at the screening site. patients with a positive reading after acetic acid or a smear indicating a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (sil) were referred for immediate colposcopy, biopsy, and when indicated, treatment by large loop excision of the transformation zone. therefore, histology was obtained on all patients with a positive acetic acid test or a positive cytology. results seventy-six women with positive reactions to acetic acid. among the 2350 women with negative reactions, 254 had positive cervical smears; only 11 of these had histologic high-grade sil. in contrast, 20 of the 61 women with positive cytology and positive acetic acid test had high-grade sil on histology. therefore, the acetic acid reaction enabled the observer to detect 20 of the 31 women (64%) who exhibited a high-grade sil both on cytology and histology. conclusion in locations where access to cytopathology is limited, naked-eye visualization of the cervix after application of diluted acetic acid warrants consideration as an alternative in the detection of cervical premalignant lesions.
current models in skeletal muscle biology do not fully account for the breadth, causes, and consequences of phenotypic variation among skeletal muscle groups. the muscle allotype concept arose to explain frank differences between limb, masticatory, and extraocular (eom) muscles, but there is little understanding of the developmental regulation of the skeletal muscle phenotypic range. here, we used morphological and dna microarray analyses to generate a comprehensive temporal profile for rat eom development. based upon coordinate regulation of morphologic/gene expression traits with key events in visual, vestibular, and oculomotor system development, we propose a model that the eom phenotype is a consequence of extrinsic factors that are unique to its local environment and sensory-motor control system, acting upon a novel myoblast lineage. we identified a broad spectrum of differences between the postnatal transcriptional patterns of eom and limb muscle allotypes, including numerous transcripts not traditionally associated with muscle fiber/group differences. several transcription factors were differentially regulated and may be responsible for signaling muscle allotype specificity. significant differences in cellular energetic mechanisms defined the eom and limb allotypes. the allotypes were divergent in many other functional transcript classes that remain to be further explored. taken together, we suggest that the eom allotype is the consequence of tissue-specific mechanisms that direct expression of a limited number of eom-specific transcripts and broader, incremental differences in transcripts that are conserved by the two allotypes. this represents an important first step in dissecting allotype-specific regulatory mechanisms that may, in turn, explain differential muscle group sensitivity to a variety of metabolic and neuromuscular diseases. abstract the genetic and epigenetic influences that establish and maintain the unique phenotype of the extraocular muscles (eoms) are poorly understood. the vestibulo-ocular reflex (vor) represents an important input into the eoms, as it stabilizes eye position relative to the environment and provides a platform for function of all other eye movement systems. a role for vestibular cues in shaping eom maturation was assessed in these studies using the ototoxic nitrile compound 3’,3’-iminodipropionitrile (idpn) to eliminate the receptor hair cells that drive the vestibulo-ocular reflex. intraperitoneal injections of idpn were followed by a 2-week survival period, after which myosin heavy chain (myhc) analysis of the eoms was performed. when idpn was administered to juvenile rats, the proportion of eye muscle fibers expressing developmental and fast myosins was increased, while eom-specific myhc mrna levels were downregulated. by contrast, idpn treatment in adult rats affected only the proportion of fibers expressing developmental myhc isoforms, leaving the eom-specific myhc mrna unaltered. these data provide evidence that the vor modulates eom-specific myhc expression in development. the lack of significant changes in eom-specific myhc expression in adult eom following idpn administration suggests that there may be a critical period during development when alterations in vestibular activity have significant and permanent consequences for the eye muscles.
tivozanib is a potent selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (vegfrs) 1, 2, and 3. this phase ib study investigated the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics (pk), and activity of tivozanib with weekly paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer (mbc). mbc patients with no prior vegfr tki treatment received daily oral tivozanib (3 weeks on, 1 week off) with weekly paclitaxel 90 mg/m2. standard 3 + 3 dose escalation was used; tivozanib cohorts (c) included c1 0.5 mg, c2 1.0 mg, and c3 1.5 mg. assessments included response evaluation criteria in solid tumors response, pk, and vascular function. eighteen patients enrolled. toxicities in >20 % of patients included fatigue, alopecia, nausea, diarrhea, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and hypertension. grade 3/4 toxicities in >15 % of patients included fatigue and neutropenia. maximum tolerated dose was tivozanib 1.5 mg with paclitaxel 90 mg/m2. four patients withdrew because of toxicity and one due to progressive disease. thirteen patients were evaluable for response: four (30.8 %) had confirmed partial response; four had stable disease ≥6 months (30.8 %). pk data suggest no influence of paclitaxel on tivozanib concentrations. tivozanib plus weekly paclitaxel was tolerable at all dose levels, supporting their combination at full dose. activity in this small population was encouraging. purpose: to assess the maximum tolerated dose (mtd)/dose-limiting toxicities (dlt), safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of tivozanib, a potent and selective oral vegf receptor (vegfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. experimental design: dose levels of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/d tivozanib for 28 days followed by 14 days of medication were explored in patients with advanced solid tumors. results: forty-one patients were enrolled. animal data incorrectly predicted toxicity, resulting in dlts at the starting dose (2.0 mg) consisting of grade 3 proteinuria and hypertension and grade 3 ataxia. at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. at an intermediate dose (1.5 mg), 1 patient experienced dlt consisting of grade 3 hypertension. this dose was determined as the mtd. of 10 additional patients treated at 1.5 mg, 1 patient each experienced grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 fatigue, and 2 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevation. in 12 additional patients treated at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. pharmacokinetics displayed long absorption time, dose proportional exposure, and a half-life of 4.7 days. plasma levels of vegf-a and soluble vegfr-2 showed dose-dependent increases and decreases, respectively. dynamic contrast-enhanced mri indicated reduction in tumor perfusion. clinical activity was observed in renal cell cancer, colorectal cancer, and other tumors. conclusion: tivozanib was well tolerated with manageable side effects. the pharmacokinetics profile revealed that tivozanib was suitable for once-daily dosing. encouraging and durable clinical activity was observed. the recommended daily dose of tivozanib in a 4-week-on and 2-week-off dosing regimen is 1.5 mg. clin cancer res; 17(22); 7156–63. ©2011 aacr.
objectiverapid eye movement (rem) rebound is a polysomnographic phenomenon where a substantial increase in rem sleep is noted in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea (osa) when first undergoing continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) titration. the objectives of this study are to determine: 1) the percentage of patients experiencing rem rebound during cpap titrations, 2) to quantify the relative increase in rem sleep duration and 3) to identify if there are patient variables associated with rem rebound.methodsfour databases (including pubmed/medline) were systematically searched through march 12, 2017.resultsfour hundred sixty-seven articles were screened, 58 were reviewed in full-text form and 14 studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review. eleven of the fourteen studies noted a statistically significant increase in amount of rem sleep during the titration night, compared to baseline sleep study. pre- and post-cpap rem sleep duration percentage means ± standard deviations (m ± sd) in 1119 patients increased from 13.8 ± 8.2% to 20.0 ± 10.1%; random effects modeling demonstrated a mean difference of 7.86 (%) [95% ci 5.01, 10.70], p-value <0.00001, corresponding to a 57% relative increase in rem sleep duration. the standardized mean difference (smd) is 0.90 [95% ci 0.59, 1.22], representing a large magnitude of effect.conclusionsin studies reporting rem rebound, the rem sleep duration increased by 57% during the first cpap titration night compared to the baseline sleep study. the prevalence of rem rebound varied between 23 and 46%. a low amount of rem sleep on the diagnostic psg predicted rem rebound. remmers, j. e., w. j. degroot, e. k. sauerland, and a. m. anch. pathogenesis of upper airww occlusion during . sleep. j. appl. physiol.: respirat. environ. exercise physiol. 44ftik 931-938, 1978. -ten patients with daytime somnolence and obesity were found to have periodic airway occlusion (ao) during nocturnal sleep. the cyclical ventilatory pattern consisted of a series of regular inspiratory efforts against an occluded airway (occlusive phase) alternating with a period of regular breathing (ventilatory phase). significant periods of central respiratory apnea were observed only in one case. the effects of pharyngeal intubation and pharyngeal pressure recordings showed that the locus of airway closure lay in the oropharynx. the genioglossal electromyogram (emg) consistently revealed periodicity: low level activity at the onset of occlusion and prominent discharge at the instant of pharyngeal opening. in one case, this activity was closely related to pharyngeal patency, whereas in other cases there was considerable overlap between emg values recorded during occluded and ventilatory phases. in these cases, the relationship of genioglossal discharge to pharyngeal pressure correlated with the presence or absence of pharyngeal occlusion. we speculate that genioglossal force act,s to open the oropharynx and that negative pharyngeal pressure promotes pharyngeal closure. the results are consistent with the idea that, once the pharvnx has collapsed, relative recruitment of genioglossal and inspiratory muscle act.ivity is such that the latter influence outstrips the former, so that pharyngeal transmural pressure increases more than genioglossal force. pharyngeal opening occurs coincident with arousal and preferential activation of the genioglossus muscle of the tongue.
background prior studies indicated improved early mortality and paraplegia rates in a small cohort of patients with type i-iii thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (taas) treated with atriofemoral bypass (afb) and motor-evoked potentials (mevps) when compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients treated with the clamp and sew (cs) method, wherein epidural cooling was the principal spinal cord protective adjunct. the use of afb/mevp increases the complexity of taa repair and in this study, we address whether the early benefits will be sustained when this is applied to a general population with type i-iii taas.   methods consecutive patients undergoing repair of nonruptured crawford extent i-iii taas from 1/1987 to 12/2011 were identified. patients were stratified according to operative approach (afb/mevp vs cs). endpoints included long-term survival, and the composite outcome of perioperative death and paraplegia. a multivariate, risk-adjusted model was then created to determine if operative approach independently influenced outcome.   results there were 485 patients (cs = 385 [79%]; afb/mevp = 100 [21%]). the cohorts differed in that the afb/mevp group was younger (65.8 ± 12.5 years vs 70.9 ± 9.7 years; p < .001), had more extent i/ii aneurysms (66% vs 50.1%; p = .005), and had more chronic dissections (30.3% vs 18.9%; p = .018). operative variables differed in that the afb/mevp cohort had longer operative times (434 ± 112 minutes vs 324 ± 98 minutes; p < .001) and higher blood turnover (6028 ± 3473 ml vs 3581 ± 3111 ml; p < .0001). there was no difference in the rate of intraoperative death (afb/mevp = 1.0% vs cs = 0.5%; p = .50), length of intensive care unit stay (afb/mevp = 9.6 ± 8.6 days vs cs = 9.5 ± 12.3 days; p = .95) or hospital length of stay (afb/mevp = 19.9 ± 12.6 days vs cs = 21.6 ± 23.5 days; p = .49). the composite perioperative death and paraplegia rate was lower in the afb/mevp cohort (7% vs 19%; p = .004). the multivariate model for predictors of the composite outcome showed that afb/mevp was protective (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.9; p = .028). long-term (4-year) survival was improved in the afb/mevp group as well (73 ± 6% vs 60 ± 3%; p = .004).   conclusions afb/mevp is an independent predictor of improved perioperative death and paraplegia rates as well as long-term survival in patients undergoing repair of type i-iii taas and is the preferred operative strategy. objective to report the long-term results of our experience using cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion in descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair. summary background data repair of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm by the traditional clamp-and-go technique results in a massive ischemic insult to several major organ systems. ten years ago, we began to use distal aortic perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid drainage (adjunct) to reduce end-organ ischemia. methods between january 1991 and february 2003, we performed 1004 thoracoabdominal or descending thoracic repairs. adjunct was used in 741 (74%) of 1004. multivariable data were analyzed by cox regression. number needed to treat was calculated as the reciprocal of the risk difference. results immediate neurologic deficit was 18 (2.4%) of 741 with adjunct and 18 (6.8%) of 263 without (p < 0.0009). in high-risk extent ii aneurysms, the numbers were 11 (6.6%) of 167 with adjunct, and 11 (29%) of 38 without. long-term survival was improved with adjunct (p < 0.002). the long-term survival results persisted after adjustment for age, extent ii aneurysm, and preoperative renal function. conclusion use of adjunct over a long period of time has produced favorable results; approximately 1 neurologic deficit saved for every 20 uses of adjunct overall. in extent ii aneurysms, where the effect is greatest, this increases to 1 saved per 5 uses. adjunct is also associated with long-term survival, which is consistent with mitigation of ischemic end-organ injury. these long-term results indicate that cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion are safe and effective adjunct for reducing morbidity and mortality following thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair.
forty-four patients with malignant diseases for which they received peripheral stem cell transplant therapy (psct) were retrospectively studied regarding local and systemic infection originating from around partially erupted third molars (pems). twenty-two patients had one or more pems, while 22 patients had none. data were retrieved from medical and dental records. systemic and local signs of infection and treatment were assessed. we recorded the number of transplanted cd34(+) blood stem cells, days with white blood cell counts < 0.5 x 10(9) l(-1), days until engraftment, maximum level of c-reactive protein (crp), days with fever, positive blood cultures, days taking antibiotics, days drinking < 0.5 l, days of total parenteral nutrition, days receiving intravenously administered analgesics, and number of admission days. no statistically significant difference was detected between patients with pems and those without pems regarding any of the studied parameters. of patients with pems, 36% (8 of 22) developed local infections around pems during the psct period. the study indicates that pems pose no significant risk of causing systemic infection in patients receiving psct for malignant diseases but increase the risk of developing a local infection, justifying close supervision and early treatment in cases of local infection during psct treatment. viridans streptococci were the most common cause of bacteremia in 61 consecutive myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients, occurring in 19 of 31 bacteremic patients (61%) during the period of post-transplant neutropenia. seven of the 19 had more than one viridans streptococcus in the same blood culture. twenty isolates from 15 patients were streptococcus mitis. most viridans streptococci were resistant to norfloxacin, used routinely for prophylaxis. comparison of the 19 patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia with a contemporaneous group of 23 allogeneic hsct recipients with fever and neutropenia but no identified focus of infection found that patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia were more likely to have severe intraoral pathology while neutropenic (26% vs 0%) and slightly shorter interval between the last dental procedure and the onset of neutropenia (11 vs 14 days). poor underlying dental health and the use of norfloxacin thus appear to predispose to viridans streptococcal bacteremia. bone marrow transplantation (2001) 27, 537–542.
this retrospective study was carried out on 15 patients who underwent laparoscopy for the removal of a mislocated iud from 2003 to 2009. the mean duration of usage of an iud was 16.1 months. the iud was found in the pouch of douglas in six patients; in the posterior wall of the uterus in three patients; in the adnexa in three patients; in the omentum in two patients and it was embedded in the rectal serosa in one patient. the types of the iuds were tcu-380a (n = 13) and mirena® (n = 2). the mean laparoscopic operation time was 25 min. no major complications occurred. a second ancillary port was required in three patients. all patients were discharged within 24 h. laparoscopic removal of the intra-abdominal iud must be the first choice of therapy. if possible, a single ancillary port should be preferred for the removal of mislocated iuds. we advise that surgical removal and surgical risk should be discussed with the patients, even if asymptomatic. objective this prospective study aimed to evaluate an alternative laparoscopic extracorporeal approach for the treatment of benign ovarian cysts.   materials and methods the initial study population included 243 patients diagnosed with benign ovarian masses. two patients with suspected malignancies and 21 patients with technical difficulties secondary to severe, dense pelvic adhesions were excluded from the study, and the final study population, therefore, comprised 220 patients. a primary 10-mm trocar was inserted, followed by a second incision on the side of the cyst and the introduction of an ancillary 5-mm trocar. the cystic content was aspirated using a needle. the capsule was held using an endograsper inserted through the ancillary trocar. the capsule was extracted from the abdomen. the 5-mm trocar and the endograsper were removed from the abdomen simultaneously. the capsule was completely detached. homeostasis was performed and the ovary was then released.   results the mean duration of the operation was 20 +/- 5 minutes. the size of the cysts ranged from 5 cm to 15 cm (mean, 8.4 +/- 2.6 cm). the pathologies of the cysts were simple cyst in 86 cases, endometrioma in 68, serous cyst in 57, mucinous cyst in eight and borderline in one. the perioperative complication rate was 2.27%.   conclusion this technique does not require the use of two or more ancillary trocars or widening of the trocar incision. the duration of surgery can be shortened considerably and complete excision of the cystic capsule can be performed. homeostasis was achieved using 3-0 polyglactin sutures. no electrocoagulation was required.
purposeto assess the outcome of patients with choroidal neovascularization (cnv) secondary to punctate inner choroidopathy (pic) receiving intravitreal anti-vegf (vascular endothelial growth factor) injections.methodssixteen eyes of 16 patients diagnosed with cnv secondary to pic were retrospectively assessed.resultseleven women and five men with a mean age of 35 years (sd 11, range 16–56 years) received intravitreal anti-vegf for pic-related cnv. on average, 3.5 injections (sd 2.7, range 1–9) were given per eye. thirteen eyes were treated with bevacizumab, two eyes with ranibizumab and one eye received both substances. the mean follow-up was 15 months (sd 11, range 6–40 months). bcva improved in eight eyes (mean δ +2.8 lines), remained stable in four eyes and decreased in four eyes (mean δ −4.3 lines).conclusionscnv development is a frequent complication of pic. intravitreal anti-vegf therapy seems to be safe and effective for pic-related cnv. purpose to assess the role of bevacizumab in inflammatory ocular neovascularization.   design retrospective, multicenter, consecutive case series of inflammatory ocular neovascularization.   methods patients with inflammatory ocular neovascularization of varying causes for whom standard therapy failed were treated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. main outcome measures included improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (bcva) expressed in logarithm of minimum angle of resolution units, response of inflammatory ocular neovascularization by funduscopy and angiography, and decrease in central foveal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography at the three-month follow-up.   results at the three-month follow-up, 84 eyes of 79 patients had been treated with a mean of 1.3 injections (range, one to three). thirty-four eyes showed juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization (cnv), 34 eyes showed subfoveal cnv, eight eyes showed peripapillary cnv, and 11 eyes showed neovascularization of the disc (nvd) or neovascularization elsewhere (nve). bcva improved 2.4 lines from 0.68 (6/28 or 20/94) to 0.44 (6/17 or 20/55) (p < .001). bcva improved by one to three lines in 34.5% of the eyes, by four to six lines in 16.7% of the eyes, and by more than six lines in 14.2% of the eyes. function was unchanged in 23.8% of the eyes. bcva worsened in 10.7% (zero to three lines in 7.1%, more than four lines in 3.6%). central foveal thickness decreased from baseline 346 to 252 microm (p < .001). for cnv, 32 eyes (43.2%) had complete regression after the injection, 27 (36.5%) had partial regression, five (6.8%) had no response, and 10 eyes (13.5%) were not evaluated by the contributors. for nvd or nve, seven eyes (63.6%) had complete regression of new vessels and four eyes (36.4%) had partial regression after the injection.   conclusions intravitreal bevacizumab led to short-term significant visual improvement and regression of inflammatory ocular neovascularization in a wide variety of inflammatory ocular diseases.
cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) are assumed to mediate anorexia during bacterial infections. to improve our understanding of the role that these two cytokines serve in mediating infection during anorexia, we investigated the ability of pentoxifylline (ptx), a potent inhibitor of tnf-alpha production, to block the anorectic effects of the bacterial products lipopolysaccharide (lps) and muramyl dipeptide (mdp) in rats. intraperitoneally injected ptx (100 mg/kg body wt) completely eliminated the anorectic effect of intraperitoneally injected lps (100 microg/kg body wt) and attenuated the anorectic effect of a higher dose of intraperitoneally injected lps (250 microg/kg body wt). concurrently, ptx pretreatment suppressed low-dose lps-induced tnf-alpha production by more than 95% and il-1beta production 39%, as measured by elisa. similarly, high-dose lps-induced tnf-alpha production was reduced by approximately 90%. ptx administration also attenuated the tolerance that is normally observed with a second injection of lps. in addition, ptx pretreatment attenuated the hypophagic effect of intraperitoneally injected mdp (2 mg/kg body wt) but had no effect on the anorectic response to intraperitoneally injected recombinant human tnf-alpha (150 ug/kg body wt). the results suggest that suppression of tnf-alpha production is sufficient to attenuate lps- and mdp-induced anorexia. this is consistent with the hypothesis that tnf-alpha plays a major role in the anorexia associated with bacterial infection. the present study was designed to test whether a tolerance to the hypophagic effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and muramyl dipeptide (mdp) develops with repeated injections in rats and whether a relationship between the hypophagic effects of both compounds exists. only the first of three subsequent intraperitoneal injection of lps (100 micrograms/kg body wt each), given every 2nd day, led to a significant reduction of food intake. in contrast, mdp (1.6 mg/kg body wt) did not lose its hypophagic effect with four subsequent intraperitoneal injections. furthermore, the lps tolerance did not alter the hypophagic response to subsequently injected mdp. likewise, mdp pretreatment did not alter the hypophagic response to lps. doses of mdp and lps that were individually below the threshold for a reliable reduction of food intake (0.4 mg mdp/kg body wt + 25 micrograms lps/kg body wt) reduced food intake synergistically when injected together. the hypophagia produced by combined injections of mdp plus lps slowly diminished with repeated injections. the results indicate that separate but interacting mechanisms are involved in the feeding responses to mdp and lps. the observed synergism between mdp and lps suggests a synergistic role of bacterial muramyl peptides and lps in the anorexia during bacterial infections.
purposethe effect of various doses of methylphenidate on the binding of [123i]iodobenzamide ([123i]ibzm) to the rat d2 receptor was assessed using small animal spect.methodsd2 receptor binding was measured at baseline and after pretreatment with various doses of methylphenidate. for baseline and methylphenidate challenge, striatal equilibrium ratios (v3″) were computed as an estimation of the binding potential.resultsafter methylphenidate, striatal v3″ was 1.61 ± 0.61 (mean ± sd; 0.3 mg/kg), 0.91 ± 0.44 (3 mg/kg), 1.01 ± 0.44 (10 mg/kg), 0.91 ± 0.34 (30 mg/kg) and 0.99 ± 0.51 (60 mg/kg). baseline values amounted to 1.73 ± 0.48, 1.32 ± 0.35, 1.50 ± 0.27, 1.82 ± 0.55 and 1.66 ± 0.41, respectively. differences between baseline and methylphenidate were significant for the doses 3, 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg, whereas no significant difference was obtained for 0.3 mg/kg methylphenidate. between-group differences of percentage reduction of d2 receptor binding were only significant for the groups pretreated with 0.3 and 30 mg/kg methylphenidate, respectively.conclusionmethylphenidate between 0.3 and 60 mg/kg decreased d2 receptor binding with a maximum reduction after 30 mg/kg. as no between-group differences were evident between the groups pretreated with 3, 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg, it may be inferred that doses ≥ 3 mg/kg were sufficient to induce maximum dopamine concentration in the synaptic cleft. further investigations are needed in order to clarify whether the variation between subjects can be accounted for by different synaptic mechanisms at the presynaptic binding site. purposethe dopamine d2 receptor (d2r) is important in the mediation of addiction. [123i]iodobenzamide (ibzm), a spect ligand for the d2r, has been used for in vivo studies of d2r availability in humans, monkeys, and rats. although mouse models are important in the study of addiction, [123i]ibzm has not been used in mice spect studies. this study evaluates the use of [123i]ibzm for measuring d2r availability in mice.methodspharmacokinetics of [123i]ibzm in mice were studied with pinhole spect imaging after intravenous (i.v.) injection of [123i]ibzm (20, 40, and 70 mbq). in addition, the ability to measure the release of endogenous dopamine after amphetamine administration with [123i]ibzm spect was investigated. thirdly, i.v. administration, the standard route of administration, and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of [123i]ibzm were compared.resultsspecific binding of [123i]ibzm within the mouse striatum could be clearly visualized with spect. peak specific striatal binding ratios were reached around 90 min post-injection. after amphetamine administration, the specific binding ratios of [123i]ibzm decreased significantly (−27.2%; n = 6; p = 0.046). intravenous administration of [123i]ibzm led to significantly higher specific binding than i.p. administration of the same dose. however, we found that i.v. administration of a dose of 70 mbq [123i]ibzm might result in acute ethanol intoxication because ethanol is used as a preparative aid for the routine production of [123i]ibzm.conclusionsimaging of d2r availability and endogenous dopamine release in mice is feasible using [123i]ibzm single pinhole spect. using commercially produced [123i]ibzm, a dose of 40 mbq injected i.v. can be recommended.
abstract hepatitis a virus (hav) encodes a single polyprotein which is posttranslationally processed into the functional structural and nonstructural proteins. only one protease, viral protease 3c, has been implicated in the nine protein scissions. processing of the capsid protein precursor region generates a unique intermediate, px (vp1-2a), which accumulates in infected cells and is assumed to serve as precursor to vp1 found in virions, although the details of this reaction have not been determined. coexpression in transfected cells of a variety of p1 precursor proteins with viral protease 3c demonstrated efficient production of px, as well as vp0 and vp3; however, no mature vp1 protein was detected. to identify the c-terminal amino acid residue of hav vp1, we performed peptide sequence analysis by protease-catalyzed [18o]h2o incorporation followed by liquid chromatography ion-trap microspray tandem mass spectrometry of hav vp1 isolated from purified virions. two different cell culture-adapted isolates of hav, strains hm175pe and hm175p35, were used for these analyses. vp1 preparations from both virus isolates contained heterogeneous c termini. the predominant c-terminal amino acid in both virus preparations was vp1-ser274, which is located n terminal to a methionine residue in vp1-2a. in addition, the analysis of hm175pe recovered smaller amounts of amino acids vp1-glu273 and vp1-thr272. in the case of hm175p35, which contains valine at amino acid position vp1-273, vp1-thr272 was found in addition to vp1-ser274. the data suggest that hav 3c is not the protease responsible for generation of the vp1 c terminus. we propose the involvement of host cell protease(s) in the production of hav vp1. portions of the p1 and p2 hepatitis a virus (hav) polyprotein were generated by in vitro translation of cdna transcripts and analyzed for a primary cleavage reaction that would release the capsid protein precursor. no autocatalytic activity was observed on either side of the 2a coding sequence. incubation of these proteins with an extract containing active hav 3c protease, however, resulted in cleavage at a position approximately 40 amino acids downstream of the previously proposed p1-2a junction. this cleavage site likely accounts for the vp1-containing proteins of approximately 38-40 kda observed in hav-infected cells.
in a natural setting, speech is often accompanied by gestures. as language, speech-accompanying iconic gestures to some extent convey semantic information. however, if comprehension of the information contained in both the auditory and visual modality depends on same or different brain-networks is quite unknown. in this fmri study, we aimed at identifying the cortical areas engaged in supramodal processing of semantic information. bold changes were recorded in 18 healthy right-handed male subjects watching video clips showing an actor who either performed speech (s, acoustic) or gestures (g, visual) in more (+) or less (−) meaningful varieties. in the experimental conditions familiar speech or isolated iconic gestures were presented; during the visual control condition the volunteers watched meaningless gestures (g−), while during the acoustic control condition a foreign language was presented (s−). the conjunction of the visual and acoustic semantic processing revealed activations extending from the left inferior frontal gyrus to the precentral gyrus, and included bilateral posterior temporal regions. we conclude that proclaiming this frontotemporal network the brain's core language system is to take too narrow a view. our results rather indicate that these regions constitute a supramodal semantic processing network. symbolic gestures, such as pantomimes that signify actions (e.g., threading a needle) or emblems that facilitate social transactions (e.g., finger to lips indicating “be quiet”), play an important role in human communication. they are autonomous, can fully take the place of words, and function as complete utterances in their own right. the relationship between these gestures and spoken language remains unclear. we used functional mri to investigate whether these two forms of communication are processed by the same system in the human brain. responses to symbolic gestures, to their spoken glosses (expressing the gestures' meaning in english), and to visually and acoustically matched control stimuli were compared in a randomized block design. general linear models (glm) contrasts identified shared and unique activations and functional connectivity analyses delineated regional interactions associated with each condition. results support a model in which bilateral modality-specific areas in superior and inferior temporal cortices extract salient features from vocal-auditory and gestural-visual stimuli respectively. however, both classes of stimuli activate a common, left-lateralized network of inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions in which symbolic gestures and spoken words may be mapped onto common, corresponding conceptual representations. we suggest that these anterior and posterior perisylvian areas, identified since the mid-19th century as the core of the brain's language system, are not in fact committed to language processing, but may function as a modality-independent semiotic system that plays a broader role in human communication, linking meaning with symbols whether these are words, gestures, images, sounds, or objects.
to evaluate the effectiveness of screening using visual inspection with acetic acid (via). objective to investigate the value of acetic acid visualization of the cervix as an alternative to cytologic screening. methods a prospective study was conducted in a squatter area in cape town, south africa, on 2426 women who underwent speculum examination, naked-eye inspection of the cervix after application of acetic acid, and cytologic smear. the smears were stained and processed at the screening site. patients with a positive reading after acetic acid or a smear indicating a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (sil) were referred for immediate colposcopy, biopsy, and when indicated, treatment by large loop excision of the transformation zone. therefore, histology was obtained on all patients with a positive acetic acid test or a positive cytology. results seventy-six women with positive reactions to acetic acid. among the 2350 women with negative reactions, 254 had positive cervical smears; only 11 of these had histologic high-grade sil. in contrast, 20 of the 61 women with positive cytology and positive acetic acid test had high-grade sil on histology. therefore, the acetic acid reaction enabled the observer to detect 20 of the 31 women (64%) who exhibited a high-grade sil both on cytology and histology. conclusion in locations where access to cytopathology is limited, naked-eye visualization of the cervix after application of diluted acetic acid warrants consideration as an alternative in the detection of cervical premalignant lesions.
backgroundnutritional strategies can decrease saturated fatty acids (sfas) and increase health beneficial fatty acids (fas) in bovine milk. the pathways/genes involved in these processes are not properly defined. next-generation rna-sequencing was used to investigate the bovine mammary gland transcriptome following supplemental feeding with 5 % linseed oil (lso) or 5 % safflower oil (sfo). holstein cows in mid-lactation were fed a control diet for 28 days (control period) followed by supplementation with 5 % lso (12 cows) or 5 % sfo (12 cows) for 28 days (treatment period). milk and mammary gland biopsies were sampled on days-14 (control period), +7 and +28 (treatment period). milk was used to measure fat(fp)/protein(pp) percentages and individual fas while rna was subjected to sequencing.resultsmilk fp was decreased by 30.38 % (lso) or 32.42 % (sfo) while pp was unaffected (lso) or increased (sfo). several beneficial fas were increased by lso (c18:1n11t, cla:10t12c, cla:9c11t, c20:3n3, c20:5n3, c22:5n3) and sfo (c18:1n11t, cla:10t12c , c20:1c11, c20:2, c20:3n3) while several sfas (c4:0, c6:0, c8:0, c14:0, c16:0, c17:0, c24:0) were decreased by both treatments (p < 0.05). 1006 (460 up- and 546 down-regulated) and 199 (127 up- and 72 down-regulated) genes were significantly differentially regulated (de) by lso and sfo, respectively. top regulated genes (≥2 fold change) by both treatments (fbp2, ucp2, tieg2, angptl4, aldh1l2) are potential candidate genes for milk fat traits. involvement of scp2, pdk4, nqo1, f2rl1, dbi, cpt1a, cntfr, calb1, acadvl, sptlc3, pik3cg, pigz, adora2b, trib3, hpgd, igfbp2 and txn in fa/lipid metabolism in dairy cows is being reported for the first time. functional analysis indicated similar and different top enriched functions for de genes. de genes were predicted to significantly decrease synthesis of fa/lipid by both treatments and fa metabolism by lso. top canonical pathways associated with de genes of both treatments might be involved in lipid/cholesterol metabolism.conclusionthis study shows that rich α-linolenic acid lso has a greater impact on mammary gland transcriptome by affecting more genes, pathways and processes as compared to sfo, rich in linoleic acid. our study suggest that decrease in milk sfas was due to down-regulation of genes in the fa/lipid synthesis and lipid metabolism pathways while increase in pufas was due to increased availability of ruminal biohydrogenation metabolites that were up taken and incorporated into milk or used as substrate for the synthesis of pufas. backgroundbovine milk fat composition is responsive to dietary manipulation providing an avenue to modify the content of fatty acids and especially some specific unsaturated fatty acid (usfa) isomers of benefit to human health. micrornas (mirnas) regulate gene expression but their specific roles in bovine mammary gland lipogenesis are unclear. the objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of mirnas following mammary gland adaptation to dietary supplementation with 5 % linseed or safflower oil using next generation rna-sequencing.methodstwenty-four canadian holstein dairy cows (twelve per treatment) in mid lactation were fed a control diet (total mixed ration of corn:grass silages) for 28 days followed by a treatment period (control diet supplemented with 5 % linseed or safflower oil) of 28 days. milk samples were collected weekly for fat and individual fatty acid determination. rna from mammary gland biopsies harvested on day-14 (control period) and on days +7 and +28 (treatment period) from six randomly selected cows per treatment was subjected to small rna sequencing.resultsmilk fat percentage decreased significantly (p < 0.001) during treatment with the two diets as compared to the control period. the individual saturated fatty acids c4:0, c6:0, c8:0, c14:0 and c16:0 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) while five usfas (c14:1, c18:1n11t, c20:3n3, c20:5n3 and cla:t10c12) increased remarkably (p < 0.05) in response to both treatments. analysis of 361 million sequence reads generated 321 known bovine mirnas and 176 novel mirnas. the expression of fourteen and twenty-two mirnas was affected (p < 0.05) by linseed and safflower oil treatments, respectively. seven mirnas including six up-regulated (bta-mir-199c, mir-199a-3p, mir-98, mir-378, mir-148b and mir-21-5p) and one down-regulated (bta-mir-200a) were found to be regulated (p < 0.05) by both treatments, and thus considered core differentially expressed (de) mirnas. the gene targets of core de mirnas have functions related to gene expression and general cellular metabolism (p < 0.05) and are enriched in four pathways of lipid metabolism (3-phosphoinositide biosynthesis, 3-phosphoinositide degradation, d-myo-inisitol-5-phosphate metabolism and the superpathway of inositol phosphate compounds).conclusionour results suggest that de mirnas in this study might be important regulators of bovine mammary lipogenesis and metabolism. the novel mirnas identified in this study will further enrich the bovine mirnome repertoire and contribute to understanding mammary gland biology.
purpose to examine the effects of exercise intensity on acute changes in endothelial function in lean and obese adults. methods sixteen lean (bmi <25, age 23±3 yr) and 10 obese (bmi >30, age 26±6 yr) physically inactive adults were studied during 3 randomized admissions [control (c, no exercise), moderate-intensity exercise (m, @ lactate threshold (lt)) and high-intensity exercise (h, midway between lt and vo2peak) (30 min)]. endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (fmd) at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 h post-exercise. results rm ancova revealed significant main effects for group, time, and group x condition interaction (p<0.05). a diurnal increase in fmd was observed in lean but not obese subjects. lean subjects exhibited greater increases in fmd than obese subjects (p = 0.0005). in the obese group a trend was observed for increases in fmd at 2- and 4-hr after m (p = 0.08). for lean subjects, fmd was significantly elevated at all time points after h. the increase in fmd after h in lean subjects (3.2±0.5%) was greater than after both c (1.7±0.4%, p = 0.015) and m (1.4±0.4%, p = 0.002). fmd responses of lean and obese subjects significantly differed after c and h, but not after m. conclusion in lean young adults, high-intensity exercise acutely enhances endothelial function, while moderate-intensity exercise has no significant effect above that seen in the absence of exercise. the fmd response of obese adults is blunted compared to lean adults. diurnal variation should be considered when examining the effects of acute exercise on fmd. objective: to ascertain in obesity the role of body fat distribution (the strongest predictor of morbility and mortality in obese subjects) in determining the degree of endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of atherosclerotic disease.subjects: 18 premenopausal women with uncomplicated obesity excluding other cardiovascular risk factors and 12 age-matched slim healthy women.measurements: endothelium-dependent vasodilation, studied as diameter variation in response to an increase in shear-stress, was evaluated in the right common femoral artery of obese and slim subjects by a non invasive approach and compared to glyceril-trinitrate vasodilation. to characterize better the vascular functional and/or structural properties, we studied the arterial wall distensibility by an echo-tracking system. adipose tissue regional distribution was determined by computerised axial tomography.results: the endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly impaired in obese subjects (p<0.005 versus non-obese subjects) while glyceril-trinitrate vasodilation and arterial distensibility were similar in the two groups. in our obese subjects endothelial-dependent vasodilation was inversely correlated to body fat distribution (visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio: r=− 0.624, p=0.0058). in contrast, metabolic parameters (except c-peptide response during oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): r=−0.587, p=0.01), blood pressure values and body weight did not correlate with the endothelial function.conclusion: uncomplicated obesity per se is characterised by an alteration of the endothelial function; the degree of this vascular damage is predicted by body fat distribution independently of body weight and metabolic and other haemodynamic parameters, and correlates with an index of insulin secretion.
background a decline in hiv incidence has been reported in zambia and a number of other sub-saharan countries. the trend of hiv prevalence among young people is a good marker of hiv incidence. in this study, different data sources are used to examine geographical and sub-population group differentials in hiv prevalence trends among men and women aged 15–24 years in zambia. design and methods we analysed anc data for women aged 15–24 years from 22 sentinel sites consistently covered in the period 1994–2008, and hiv data for young men and women aged 15–24 years from the zdhs 2001/2 and 2007. in addition, we systematically reviewed peer-reviewed articles that have reported findings on hiv prevalence and incidence among young people. findings overall trends of the anc surveillance data indicated a substantial hiv prevalence decline among young women in both urban and rural areas. however, provincial declines differed substantially, i.e. between 10% and 68% among urban women, and from stability to 86% among rural women. prevalence declines were steeper among those with the highest educational attainments than among the least educated. the zdhs data indicated a significant reduction in prevalence between the two survey rounds among young women only. provincial-level zdhs changes were difficult to assess because the sample sizes were small. anc-based trend patterns were consistent with those observed in pmtct-based data (2002–2006), whereas population-based surveys in a selected urban community (1995–2003) suggested that the anc-based data underestimated the prevalence declines in the general populations of both young both men and women. conclusion the overall hiv prevalence declined substantially among young women in zambia and this is interpreted as indicating a decline in hiv incidence. it is noteworthy that overall national trends masked substantial differences by place and by educational attainment, demonstrating critical limitations in the current focus on overall country-level trends in epidemiological reports. backgroundthe premise for using antenatal care (anc) clinic data for estimating hiv prevalence in the general population is the finding from community studies in sub-saharan africa that total hiv prevalence in pregnant women attending anc clinics closely approximate levels in the total general population of both women and men aged 15–49 years. in this study, the validity of national level hiv prevalence estimates for the total general population 15–49 years made from anc clinic and population survey data was assessed.methodsin 2001–2002, a national population hiv prevalence survey for women 15–49 years and men 15–59 years was conducted in zambia. in the same period, a national hiv sentinel surveillance survey among pregnant women attending anc clinics was carried out.resultsthe anc hiv prevalence estimates for age-group 15–49 years (rural: 11.5%; 95% ci, 11.2–11.8; urban: 25.4%; 95% ci, 24.8–26.0; adjusted national: 16.9%; 95% ci, 16.6–17.2) were similar to the population survey estimates (rural: 10.8%; 95% ci, 9.6–12.1; urban: 23.2%; 95% ci 20.7–25.6; national: 15.6%; 95% ci, 14.4–16.9). the hiv prevalence urban to rural ratio was 2.2 in anc and 2.1 in population survey estimates.conclusionthe hiv prevalence estimate for the total general population 15–49 years derived from testing both women and men in the population survey was similar to the estimate derived from testing women attending anc clinics. it shows that national hiv prevalence estimates for adults aged 15–49 years can also be obtained from anc hiv sentinel surveillance surveys with good coverage when anc attendance and fertility are high.
abstract previous work from our lab suggests that a group of interdependent assembly factors (a3 factors) is necessary to create early, stable preribosomes. many of these proteins bind at or near internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2), but in their absence, its1 is not removed from rrna, suggesting long-range communication between these two spacers. by comparing the nonessential assembly factors nop12 and pwp1, we show that misfolding of rrna is sufficient to perturb early steps of biogenesis, but it is the lack of a3 factors that results in turnover of early preribosomes. deletion of nop12 significantly inhibits 27sa3 pre-rrna processing, even though the a3 factors are present in preribosomes. furthermore, pre-rrnas are stable, indicating that the block in processing is not sufficient to trigger turnover. this is in contrast to the absence of pwp1, in which the a3 factors are not present and pre-rrnas are unstable. in vivo rna structure probing revealed that the pre-rrna processing defects are due to misfolding of 5.8s rrna. in the absence of nop12 and pwp1, rrna helix 5 is not stably formed. interestingly, the absence of nop12 results in the formation of an alternative yet unproductive helix 5 when cells are grown at low temperatures. ribosome biogenesis is a complex multistep process that involves alternating steps of folding and processing of pre-rrnas in concert with assembly of ribosomal proteins. recently, there has been increased interest in the roles of ribosomal proteins in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis in vivo, focusing primarily on their function in pre-rrna processing. however, much less is known about participation of ribosomal proteins in the formation and rearrangement of preribosomal particles as they mature to functional subunits. we have studied ribosomal proteins l7 and l8, which are required for the same early steps in pre-rrna processing during assembly of 60s subunits but are located in different domains within ribosomes. depletion of either leads to defects in processing of 27sa(3) to 27sb pre-rrna and turnover of pre-rrnas destined for large ribosomal subunits. a specific subset of proteins is diminished from these residual assembly intermediates: six assembly factors required for processing of 27sa(3) pre-rrna and four ribosomal proteins bound to domain i of 25s and 5.8s rrnas surrounding the polypeptide exit tunnel. in addition, specific sets of ribosomal proteins are affected in each mutant: in the absence of l7, proteins bound to domain ii, l6, l14, l20, and l33 are greatly diminished, while proteins l13, l15, and l36 that bind to domain i are affected in the absence of l8. thus, l7 and l8 might establish rnp structures within assembling ribosomes necessary for the stable association and function of the a(3) assembly factors and for proper assembly of the neighborhoods containing domains i and ii.
botulinum neurotoxins (bont) are considered some of the most lethal known substances. there are seven botulinum serotypes, of which types a, b and e cause most human botulism cases. anti-botulinum polyclonal antibodies (pabs) are currently used for both detection and treatment of the disease. however, significant improvements in immunoassay specificity and treatment safety may be made using monoclonal antibodies (mabs). in this study, we present an approach for the simultaneous generation of highly specific and neutralizing mabs against botulinum serotypes a, b, and e in a single process. the approach relies on immunization of mice with a trivalent mixture of recombinant c-terminal fragment (hc) of each of the three neurotoxins, followed by a parallel differential robotic hybridoma screening. this strategy enabled the cloning of seven to nine mabs against each serotype. the majority of the mabs possessed higher anti-botulinum elisa titers than anti-botulinum pabs and had up to five orders of magnitude greater specificity. when tested for their potency in mice, neutralizing mabs were obtained for all three serotypes and protected against toxin doses of 10 msld50–500 msld50. a strong synergistic effect of up to 400-fold enhancement in the neutralizing activity was observed when serotype-specific mabs were combined. furthermore, the highly protective oligoclonal combinations were as potent as a horse-derived pab pharmaceutical preparation. interestingly, mabs that failed to demonstrate individual neutralizing activity were observed to make a significant contribution to the synergistic effect in the oligoclonal preparation. together, the trivalent immunization strategy and differential screening approach enabled us to generate highly specific mabs against each of the a, b, and e bonts. these new mabs may possess diagnostic and therapeutic potential. we have previously demonstrated how to transform the conventional method of hybridoma production and screening into a fast, high‐throughput technology. nevertheless, there were still open questions related to automated procedures and immunization protocols that we address now by comparing the hybridoma production work‐flow in automated and manually executed processes. in addition, since the animals' antibody responses to single or multiple antigen challenge affect monoclonal antibody throughput, different immunization and fusion strategies were tested. specifically, the results obtained with multiplexing (multiple target antigens injected into a single animal) and single antigen immunization followed by splenocyte pooling immediately before fusion were compared with conventional methods. the results presented here demonstrate that the optimal protocol consists of automated somatic‐cell fusion and hybridoma dilution followed by manual plating of hybridoma cells. additionally, more specific and productive hybridoma clones were obtained with multiplexed immunization in a single animal with respect to the splenocyte pooling from single antigen immunized animals. however, in terms of overall antibody yield, the conventional method consisting of single immunization for each single animal assured ten times more specific hybridoma cell lines than the strategy based on the multiple antigen immunization followed by separate fusion step. in conclusion, the most productive approach for recovering a large number of suitable antibodies relies on single antigen immunization followed by automated fusion and dilution steps and manual plating. © 2011 american institute of chemical engineers biotechnol. prog., 2011
interleukin-21 (il-21) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). the aim of our study was to assess serum levels of il-21 in patients with recent-onset ra in relation to disease activity and response to treatment. we analyzed serum levels of il-21 in 51 ra patients, both before and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment and in 36 healthy individuals. disease activity was assessed at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24 using the disease activity score for 28 joints, serum levels of c-reactive protein, and the total swollen joint count. we found that il-21 levels were not increased in patients with recent-onset ra compared with healthy controls, but they had significantly decreased from baseline to week 12 during treatment. baseline levels of il-21 significantly correlated with measures of disease activity (p<0.02 for all). although il-21 levels did not predict achievement of remission, decrease in il-21 levels correlated with improvement in disease activity after 12 weeks (p<0.02) and also after 24 weeks (p<0.04) of treatment. our data suggest that circulating il-21 levels may serve as a biomarker of disease activity and better outcome in early phase of ra. objective. to investigate the levels of the t helper (th)17-related cytokines interleukin 17a (il-17a), il-21, and il-23 and their association with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods. in a longitudinal sample set from patients with early ra (< 6 months; n = 40), we measured the plasma cytokine levels of il-17a, il-21, and il-23 and analyzed for correlation with disease activity in 28 joints (disease activity score 28-joint count; das28), c-reactive protein (crp), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), and total sharp score (tss). in a transverse sample set of patients with chronic ra (> 8 years), using paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells, we investigated the cellular expression of il-17a, il-21, and il-23r. results. patients with early-stage ra had significantly increased plasma levels of il-21 and il-23, but not il-17a, compared to patients with chronic ra and healthy volunteer controls. plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 after 12 months of treatment correlated with das28 and esr, but not to tss. changes in il-23 plasma levels from time of diagnosis to 12 months correlated with change in das28 and with tss scores at 2 years. the numbers of cd4+ t cells producing il-21 were significantly increased in the synovial fluid of patients with chronic ra, with only marginal coexpression of il-21 and il-17a. conclusion. our results show a significant association between plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 and disease activity in ra, supporting the hypothesis that il-21 and il-23 are important pathogenic factors of this disease.
in late mitosis and early g1, mcm2-7 complexes are loaded onto dna to license replication origins for use in the upcoming s phase. however, the amount of mcm2-7 loaded is in significant excess over the number of origins normally used. we show here that in human cells, excess chromatin-bound mcm2-7 license dormant replication origins that do not fire during normal dna replication, in part due to checkpoint activity. dormant origins were activated within active replicon clusters if replication fork progression was inhibited, despite the activation of s-phase checkpoints. after lowering levels of chromatin-bound mcm2-7 in human cells by rna interference (rnai), the use of dormant origins was suppressed in response to replicative stress. although cells with lowered chromatin-bound mcm2-7 replicated at normal rates, when challenged with replication inhibitors they had dramatically reduced rates of dna synthesis and reduced viability. these results suggest that the use of dormant origins licensed by excess mcm2-7 is a new and physiologically important mechanism that cells utilize to maintain dna replication rates under conditions of replicative stress. we propose that checkpoint kinase activity can preferentially suppress initiation within inactive replicon clusters, thereby directing new initiation events toward active clusters that are experiencing replication problems. the inhibition of dna synthesis in normal human cells by uv is a complex function of fluence because it has several causes. at low fluences, inhibition of replicon initiation is most important. this is made clear by the fact that it occurs to a lesser degree in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (at). assuming that only leading strand synthesis is blocked by uv-induced lesions, single lesions between replicons in parental strands for leading strand synthesis inhibit dna synthesis by acting as temporary blocks until they are replicated by extension of the lagging strand of the adjacent replicon. a more severe inhibition occurs when two lesions are induced between adjacent growing replicons, because one in four possible configurations may result in a long-lived unreplicated region (llur). in the absence of excision repair, these may eventually be replicated by activation of an otherwise unused origin within the llur. the frequency of llurs increases steeply with fluence. activation of normally unused origins to replicate llurs may facilitate recovery from inhibition of dna synthesis, but repair of lesions is probably more important. in excision-repair-defective cells, an llur without an origin to initiate its replication may be a lethal lesion.
we evaluate the surgical outcomes and surgical responses of medial rectus muscle (mr) recession patients with thyroid eye disease (ted)-related esotropia (et). the surgical dose-response curves 1 week postoperatively and at the final visit were analyzed. univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were applied to investigate factors influencing surgical dose-response. a total of 43 patients with ted-related et that underwent mr recession were included. the final success rate was 86.0% and the rate of undercorrection was 14.0%. the surgical dose-response curves of ted-related et showed a gentle slope compared with those of standard surgical tables. in the univariable model, simultaneous vertical rectus muscle recession was the only significant factor influencing surgical dose-response of mr recession in ted-related et (β = -0.397, p = 0.044). in a model adjusted for age, sex, type of surgery, and preoperative horizontal angle of deviation, simultaneous vertical rectus muscle recession showed marginal significance (β = -0.389, p = 0.064). the surgical dose-response curve of ted-related et was unique. simultaneous vertical rectus muscle recession was associated with increased surgical dose-response in ted-related et. purpose to evaluate the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of medial rectus (mr) recessions in patients with graves' ophthalmopathy.   patients and methods the clinical records of 32 patients with graves' ophthalmopathy who underwent mr recessions with adjustable sutures for restrictive esotropia were reviewed. the clinical characteristics of patients, the size of the esodeviations, the limitations of ductions, the surgical doses, and observed responses to surgery were recorded and analyzed. main outcome measures included the ratio of predicted to observed correction for mr recessions, improvement in ductions, and restoration of binocular status.   results the mean age of the 32 patients (20 women, 12 men) at surgery was 54.1+/-11.4 years. the mean duration of thyroid eye disease was 4.3+/-5.4 years (range, 1 to 24 years). the ratios of predicted to observed correction for esodeviations at distance and near, respectively, were 2.21+/-1.24 and 2.16+/-1.81 at the time of adjustment and 1.61+/-0.37 and 1.84+/-0.90 at final follow-up. the limitation of abduction improved from -2.3+/-1.3 to -0.75 +/-0.98. binocular single vision was achieved in 73% of patients, and a further 10% of patients were able to fuse with prisms. a history of decompression was present in 75% of cases. patients with a history of decompression had more restriction in abduction (-2.49 vs -1.78, p =.061), more frequently required bilateral surgery (75% vs 62.5%), and had a higher ratio of predicted to observed correction (1.71 -0.37 vs 1.37+/-0.28, p = .043).   conclusions patients with graves' ophthalmopathy who undergo mr recession for restrictive esotropia are prone to undercorrection. a history of decompression is associated with a less favorable clinical outcome. augmented surgery, adjustable sutures, or both are recommended for improved surgical outcomes.
at synapses, two major processes occur concomitantly after the release of glutamate: activation of ampa receptors (ampars) to conduct synaptic transmission and activation of excitatory amino acid transporters (eaats) for transmitter removal. although crosstalk between the receptors and eaats is conceivable, whether and how the transporter activity affects ampar synaptic localization remain unknown. using cultured hippocampal and cortical rat neurons, we show that inhibition of glutamate transporters leads to rapid reduction in ampar synaptic accumulation and total ampar abundance. eaat inactivity also results in elevated internalization and reduced surface expression of ampars. the reduction in ampar amount is accompanied by receptor ubiquitination and can be blocked by suppression of proteasome activity, indicating the involvement of proteasome-mediated receptor degradation. consistent with glutamate spillover, effect of eaat inhibition on ampar distribution and stability is dependent on the activation of parasynaptically localized nr2b-containing nmda receptors (nmdars). moreover, we show that neuronal glutamate transporters, especially those localized at the postsynaptic sites, are responsible for the observed effect during eaat suppression. these results indicate a role for neuron-specific glutamate transporters in ampar synaptic localization and stability. the predominant neuronal glutamate transporter, eaac1 (for excitatory amino acid carrier-1), is localized to the dendrites and somata of many neurons. rare presynaptic localization is restricted to gaba terminals. because glutamate is a precursor for gaba synthesis, we hypothesized that eaac1 may play a role in regulating gaba synthesis and, thus, could cause epilepsy in rats when inactivated. reduced expression of eaac1 by antisense treatment led to behavioral abnormalities, including staring–freezing episodes and electrographic (eeg) seizures. extracellular hippocampal and thalamocortical slice recordings showed excessive excitability in antisense-treated rats. patch-clamp recordings of miniature ipscs (mipscs) conducted in ca1 pyramidal neurons in slices from eaac1 antisense-treated animals demonstrated a significant decrease in mipsc amplitude, indicating decreased tonic inhibition. there was a 50% loss of hippocampal gaba levels associated with knockdown of eaac1, and newly synthesized gaba from extracellular glutamate was significantly impaired by reduction of eaac1 expression. eaac1 may participate in normal gaba neurosynthesis and limbic hyperexcitability, whereas epilepsy can result from a disruption of the interaction between eaac1 and gaba metabolism.
vernalization, the requirement of a period of low temperature to induce transition from the vegetative to reproductive state, is an evolutionarily and economically important trait in the triticeae. the genetic basis of vernalization in cultivated barley (hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare) can be defined using the two-locus vrn-h1/vrn-h2 model. we analyzed the allelic characteristics of hvbm5a, the candidate gene for vrn-h1, from ten cultivated barley accessions and one wild progenitor accession (subsp. spontaneum), representing the three barley growth habits – winter, facultative, and spring. we present multiple lines of evidence, including sequence, linkage map location, and expression, that support hvbm5a being vrn-h1. while the predicted polypeptides from different growth habits are identical, spring accessions contain a deletion in the first intron of hvbm5a that may be important for regulation. while spring hvbm5a alleles are typified by the intron-localized deletion, in some cases, the promoter may also determine the allele type. the presence/absence of the tightly linked zcct-h gene family members on chromosome 4h perfectly correlates with growth habit and we conclude that one of the three zcct-h genes is vrn-h2. the vrn-h2 locus is present in winter genotypes and deleted from the facultative and spring genotypes analyzed in this study, suggesting the facultative growth habit (cold tolerant, vernalization unresponsive) is a result of deletion of the vrn-h2 locus and presence of a winter hvbm5a allele. all reported barley vernalization qtls can be explained by the two-locus vrn-h1/vrn-h2 model based on the presence/absence of vrn-h2 and a winter vs. spring hvbm5a allele. winter wheats require several weeks at low temperature to flower. this process, vernalization, is controlled mainly by the vrn1 gene. using 6,190 gametes, we found vrn1 to be completely linked to mads-box genes ap1 and aglg1 in a 0.03-centimorgan interval flanked by genes cysteine and cytochrome b5. no additional genes were found between the last two genes in the 324-kb triticum monococcum sequence or in the colinear regions in rice and sorghum. wheat ap1 and aglg1 genes were similar to arabidopsis meristem identity genes ap1 and agl2, respectively. ap1 transcription was regulated by vernalization in both apices and leaves, and the progressive increase of ap1 transcription was consistent with the progressive effect of vernalization on flowering time. vernalization was required for ap1 transcription in apices and leaves in winter wheat but not in spring wheat. aglg1 transcripts were detected during spike differentiation but not in vernalized apices or leaves, suggesting that ap1 acts upstream of aglg1. no differences were detected between genotypes with different vrn1 alleles in the ap1 and aglg1 coding regions, but three independent deletions were found in the promoter region of ap1. these results suggest that ap1 is a better candidate for vrn1 than aglg1. the epistatic interactions between vernalization genes vrn1 and vrn2 suggested a model in which vrn2 would repress directly or indirectly the expression of ap1. a mutation in the promoter region of ap1 would result in the lack of recognition of the repressor and in a dominant spring growth habit.
competitive interactions are believed to underlie many types of cortical processing, ranging from memory formation, attention and development of cortical functional organization (e.g., development of orientation maps in primary visual cortex). in the latter case, the competitive interactions happen along the cortical surface, with local populations of neurons reinforcing each other, while competing with those displaced more distally. this specific configuration of lateral interactions is however in stark contrast with the known properties of the anatomical substrate, i.e., excitatory connections (mediating reinforcement) having longer reach than inhibitory ones (mediating competition). no satisfactory biologically plausible resolution of this conflict between anatomical measures, and assumed cortical function has been proposed. recently a specific pattern of delays between different types of neurons in cat cortex has been discovered, where direct mono-synaptic excitation has approximately the same delay, as the combined delays of the disynaptic inhibitory interactions between excitatory neurons (i.e., the sum of delays from excitatory to inhibitory and from inhibitory to excitatory neurons). here we show that this specific pattern of delays represents a biologically plausible explanation for how short-range inhibition can support competitive interactions that underlie the development of orientation maps in primary visual cortex. we demonstrate this statement analytically under simplifying conditions, and subsequently show using network simulations that development of orientation maps is preserved when long-range excitation, direct inhibitory to inhibitory interactions, and moderate inequality in the delays between excitatory and inhibitory pathways is added. competition is a well-studied and powerful mechanism for information processing in neuronal networks, providing noise rejection, signal restoration, decision making and associative memory properties, with relatively simple requirements for network architecture. models based on competitive interactions have been used to describe the shaping of functional properties in visual cortex, as well as the development of functional maps in columnar cortex. these models require competition within a cortical area to occur on a wider spatial scale than cooperation, usually implemented by lateral inhibitory connections having a longer range than local excitatory connections. however, measurements of cortical anatomy reveal that the spatial extent of inhibition is in fact more restricted than that of excitation. relatively few models reflect this, and it is unknown whether lateral competition can occur in cortical-like networks that have a realistic spatial relationship between excitation and inhibition. here we analyze simple models for cortical columns and perform simulations of larger models to show how the spatial scales of excitation and inhibition can interact to produce competition through disynaptic inhibition. our findings give strong support to the direct coupling effect—that the presence of competition across the cortical surface is predicted well by the anatomy of direct excitatory and inhibitory coupling and that multisynaptic network effects are negligible. this implies that for networks with short-range inhibition and longer-range excitation, the spatial extent of competition is even narrower than the range of inhibitory connections. our results suggest the presence of network mechanisms that focus on intra-rather than intercolumn competition in neocortex, highlighting the need for both new models and direct experimental characterizations of lateral inhibition and competition in columnar cortex.
resting skeletal muscle is a major contributor to adaptive thermogenesis, i.e., the thermogenesis that changes in response to exposure to cold or to overfeeding. the identification of the “furnace” that is responsible for increased heat generation in resting muscle has been the subject of a number of investigations. a new state of myosin, the super relaxed state (srx), with a very slow atp turnover rate has recently been observed in skeletal muscle (stewart et al. in proc natl acad sci usa 107:430–435, 2010). inhibition of the myosin atpase activity in the srx was suggested to be caused by binding of the myosin head to the core of the thick filament in a structural motif identified earlier by electron microscopy. to be compatible with the basal metabolic rate observed in vivo for resting muscle, most myosin heads would have to be in the srx. modulation of the population of this state, relative to the normal relaxed state, was proposed to be a major contributor to adaptive thermogenesis in resting muscle. transfer of only 20% of myosin heads from the srx into the normal relaxed state would cause muscle thermogenesis to double. phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain was shown to transfer myosin heads from the srx into the relaxed state, which would increase thermogenesis. in particular, thermogenesis by myosin has been proposed to play a role in the dissipation of calories during overfeeding. up-regulation of muscle thermogenesis by pharmaceuticals that target the srx would provide new approaches to the treatment of obesity or high blood sugar levels. purpose of reviewto discuss the potential importance of spontaneous physical activity in regulating body weight and outline possible reasons for the large interindividual variance in spontaneous physical activity. recent findingsspontaneous physical activity is highly variable among people, with some having high levels and some low, and can contribute significantly to interindividual differences in total daily energy expenditure. cross-sectionally, spontaneous physical activity is inversely related to body weight; however, more importantly, spontaneous physical activity is inversely associated with weight gain in prospective studies, and experimental weight perturbations do not appear to change spontaneous physical activity behavior. spontaneous physical activity is a familial trait and is biologically influenced, although the environment exerts a significant impact. summaryalthough spontaneous physical activity is a biologically driven behavior, interventions to increase nonexercise activity within the workplace and school hold promise in increasing daily energy expenditure for the average sedentary american. however, many large-scale efforts will need to take place within our sedentary-promoting environment to encourage more daily spontaneous physical activity-related activity.
the expression of emotion can play a significant role in strategic decision-making. in this study, we hypothesized that emotion expression alters behavior in morally charged negotiation. we investigated the impact of facial displays of discrete emotions, specifically anger and sadness, in a morally charged multi-issue negotiation task. our results indicate that if a negotiator associated moral significance to the object of the negotiation, displays of anger resulted in reduced concession making whereas displays of sadness increased concession making. moral significance of the issues fostered an emotional matching mechanism of sorrow, where a sorrow expression from one party elicited a sorrow expression from the other. taken together, the results indicate that emotional expressions can affect morally charged negotiation in ways that can inhibit as well as promote cooperation. three experiments investigated the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness in negotiations. in the course of a computer-mediated negotiation, participants received information about the emotional state (anger, happiness, or none) of their opponent. consistent with a strategic-choice perspective, experiment 1 showed that participants conceded more to an angry opponent than to a happy one. experiment 2 showed that this effect was caused by tracking--participants used the emotion information to infer the other's limit, and they adjusted their demands accordingly. however, this effect was absent when the other made large concessions. experiment 3 examined the interplay between experienced and communicated emotion and showed that angry communications (unlike happy ones) induced fear and thereby mitigated the effect of the opponent's experienced emotion. these results suggest that negotiators are especially influenced by their opponent's emotions when they are motivated and able to consider them.
&na; the effects of the dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) n‐6:n‐3 ratio and vitamin e (ve) on the levels of pro‐inflammatory eicosanoids, the incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and arachidonic acid (aa) into immune tissues, and changes in leukocyte population after phytohemagglutinin (pha) challenge were investigated in broiler chickens of different ages. one‐day‐old female broilers (48 per treatment) were fed 4 different wheat‐soybean‐corn‐based diets containing corn oil with a high pufa n‐6:n‐3 ratio (hr) or a mixture of linseed and fish oils with a low pufa n‐6:n‐3 ratio (lr). diets contained either 50 mg ve kg‐1 of diet (basal ve) or 300 mg ve kg‐1 of diet (increased ve). at d 14 and d 34, 8 chickens per treatment were challenged with pha, and wing web swelling (wws) was measured. the blood concentration of leukotriene (ltb4), prostaglandin (pge2), and thromboxane (tbx2) in 17‐day‐old and 43‐day‐old chickens was determined. the pattern of aa and dha incorporation into bursa, spleen, and brain lipids reflected the level of their precursors in the diet. wws was the highest in chickens fed a lr diet and in 14‐day‐old chickens (p < 0.01). leukocyte proportions varied with dietary pufa n‐6:n‐3 ratio and with age. the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio was the highest at 6 h post pha challenge, and was higher in 34‐day‐old chickens (p < 0.001). tbx2 and pge2 concentrations were higher in chickens fed hr diet, whereas tbx2 and ltb4 concentrations were lower at high ve level. lower pge2 and ltb4, but higher tbx2 concentrations were measured in younger birds (p < 0.001). the results indicated that lr increased the phagocytic cell proportion in the blood; hr promoted the incorporation of aa into the immune tissues, which increased the levels of more pro‐inflammatory eicosanoids in the blood; and ve counteracts these effects to some extent. owing to the immaturity of the immune system, dietary interventions might be promising at the early stage of chicken growth. consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids greatly exceeds that of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic gives rise to the eicosanoid family of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes and related metabolites) and through these regulates the activities of inflammatory cells, the production of cytokines and the various balances within the immune system. fish oil and oily fish are good sources of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. consumption of these fatty acids decreases the amount of arachidonic acid in cell membranes and so available for eicosanoid production. thus, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids act as arachidonic acid antagonists. components of both natural and acquired immunity, including the production of key inflammatory cytokines, can be affected by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. although some of the effects of n-3 fatty acids may be brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, it is possible that these fatty acids might elicit some of their effects by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms. such n-3 fatty acid-induced effects may be of use as a therapy for acute and chronic inflammation, and for disorders which involve an inappropriately activated immune response.
purposemany pediatric centers admit patients following incision and drainage (i&d) of soft-tissue abscesses. the purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the same-day discharge following i&d.methodsretrospective review was performed of children aged 3 months–4 years who underwent operative i&d of an abscess followed by same-day discharge. patients receiving antibiotics within 2 weeks of presentation were excluded. treatment failure was defined as readmission or repeat procedure related to the initial abscess. statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon rank-sum and fisher’s exact tests.resultsthere were 442 procedures performed in 408 patients. mean age was 1.8 years. fever was noted in 25.8%. of those who had a white blood cell (wbc) count drawn, 59.7% had leukocytosis. mean time from procedure to discharge was 2.3 h, and 85.0% were discharged with oral antibiotics. treatment failure occurred in four (0.9%) and ten (2.3%) patients at 14 and 30 days, respectively. mean wbc count was higher in the 14-day treatment failure group (24.1 versus 16.3; p = 0.10). in patients with leukocytosis, there were 2 (1.4%) treatment failures compared to none in those without leukocytosis.conclusionsame-day discharge after i&d of abscess in diaper-age children is safe and effective. background u.s. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.   methods we conducted a randomized trial at five u.s. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. the primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.   results the median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for mrsa. in the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.1 to 11.7; p=0.005). in the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, 3.2 to 11.2; p<0.001). trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% ci, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. at 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.   conclusions in settings in which mrsa was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo.

the major modification of the c-fos protein involves serine phosphoesterification at the sites located at the extreme c-terminus. several transcriptionally important protein–protein interactions involving c-fos are mediated by the c-terminus domain phosphorylation. a series of peptides and phosphopeptides corresponding to c-terminus (359–380) of c-fos protein were synthesized and their conformations were determined by cd spectroscopy and 1h-nmr spectroscopy. the nonphosphorylated peptide (fos-c) adopts an essentially random-coil conformation in aqueous solution as shown by cd spectroscopy, but becomes slightly more ordered into a type i turn by adding up to 80% trifluoroethanol (tfe) to increase the solvent hydrophobicity. there is tentative nmr evidence for a small population of species containing a type i turn at residues sptl in the fos-c. phosphorylation at s362 induces local conformational changes that can be attributed to the formation of local hydrogen bonds between the phosphate group and nearby amide protons, including additional medium-range (ε-hn of r359) effects. upon phosphorylation at s374, a hydrogen bond between the amide proton and phosphate group of ps374 is formed. however, the most significant changes upon phosphorylation at s374 are the destabilization of this turn structure, which is strongly supported by cd and nmr spectroscopy. the bzip proto-oncoprotein c-fos activates transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in cell growth. the c-terminal activation domain of c-fos is functionally independent of the remainder of the protein. fos-ad corresponds to the c-terminal activation domain of human c-fos (residues 216-380). fos-ad suppresses (squelches) transcription in vitro, as expected for a functional activation domain lacking a dna-binding domain. fos-ad is unstructured and highly mobile, as demonstrated by circular dichroism spectra indicative of unfolded proteins, a lack of (1)h chemical shift dispersion, and negative (1)h-(15)n heteronuclear nuclear overhauser effects. the hydrodynamic properties of fos-ad are also consistent with an extended structure. we conclude that the c-terminal domain of human c-fos is biologically active yet intrinsically disordered. our results suggest that conformational disorder is an integral aspect of the diverse contributions to transcriptional regulation by c-fos.
purpose this study focuses on stop voicing differentiation in bilingual children with normal hearing (nh) and their bilingual peers with hearing loss who use cochlear implants (cis).   method twenty-two bilingual children participated in our study (11 with nh, m age = 5;1 [years;months], and 11 with cis, m hearing age = 5;1). the groups were matched on hearing age and a range of demographic variables. single-word picture elicitation was used with word-initial singleton stop consonants. repeated measures analyses of variance with three within-subject factors (language, stop voicing, and stop place of articulation) and one between-subjects factor (nh vs. ci user) were conducted with voice onset time and percentage of prevoiced stops as dependent variables.   results main effects were statistically significant for language, stop voicing, and stop place of articulation on both voice onset time and prevoicing. there were no significant main effects for nh versus ci groups. both children with nh and with cis differentiated stop voicing in their languages and by stop place of articulation. stop voicing differentiation was commensurate across the groups of children with nh versus cis.   conclusions stop voicing differentiation is accomplished in a similar fashion by bilingual children with nh and cis, and both groups differentiate stop voicing in a language-specific fashion. purpose common wisdom suggests that listening in noise poses disproportionately greater difficulty for listeners with cochlear implants (cis) than for peers with normal hearing (nh). the purpose of this study was to examine phonological, language, and cognitive skills that might help explain speech-in-noise abilities for children with cis.   method three groups of kindergartners (nh, hearing aid wearers, and ci users) were tested on speech recognition in quiet and noise and on tasks thought to underlie the abilities that fit into the domains of phonological awareness, general language, and cognitive skills. these last measures were used as predictor variables in regression analyses with speech-in-noise scores as dependent variables.   results compared to children with nh, children with cis did not perform as well on speech recognition in noise or on most other measures, including recognition in quiet. two surprising results were that (a) noise effects were consistent across groups and (b) scores on other measures did not explain any group differences in speech recognition.   conclusions limitations of implant processing take their primary toll on recognition in quiet and account for poor speech recognition and language/phonological deficits in children with cis. implications are that teachers/clinicians need to teach language/phonology directly and maximize signal-to-noise levels in the classroom.
sialic acids are nine carbon sugars ubiquitously found on the surfaces of vertebrate cells and are involved in various immune response-related processes; the overall diversity of sialic acids is often referred to as the host “sialome”. in humans, at least 58 genes spanning diverse functions, from biosynthesis and activation to recycling and degradation, are involved in sialic acid biology. several sialome genes have experienced higher rates of non-synonymous substitutions in the human lineage than their counterparts in other great apes, which may be indicative of ancient positive selection in response to pathogens. to test whether sialome genes have also experienced more recent positive selection in human populations, reflecting adaptation to contemporary cosmopolitan or geographically-restricted pathogens, we calculated several metrics that quantify changes in allele frequency spectra caused by recent selection on the protein-coding and putative enhancer regions of 55 sialome genes using whole genome sequencing data of 2,504 humans from five ethnic groups. to disentangle the effects of demography, we compared the observed patterns in sialome putative enhancer regions and genes to those of 189 housekeeping genes and their putative enhancer regions, which are known to be evolving under strong negative selection due to functional constraints. we found that the patterns of genetic variation of sialome genes and putative enhancers do not differ significantly from those of their housekeeping counterparts. furthermore, the observed patterns of genetic variation were not significantly different among the four functional categories of sialome genes. these results suggest that the genic and putative enhancer regions of sialome genes have experienced strong purifying selection but not recent positive selection. we propose that the absence of signatures of recent positive selection is consistent with the view that human sialome genes regulate immune responses against ancient rather than contemporary cosmopolitan or geographically-restricted pathogens. abstract the surface of all mammalian cells is covered with a dense and complex array of sugar chains, which are frequently terminated by members of a family of molecules called sialic acids. one particular sialic acid called n‐glycolylneuraminic acid (neu5gc) is widely expressed on most mammalian tissues, but is not easily detectable on human cells. in fact, it provokes an immune response in adult humans. the human deficiency of neu5gc is explained by an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding cmp‐n‐acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in generating neu5gc in cells of other mammals. this deficiency also results in an excess of the precursor sialic acid n‐acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac) in humans. this mutation appears universal to modern humans, occurred sometime after our last common ancestor with the great apes, and happens to be one of the first known human‐great ape genetic differences with an obvious biochemical readout. while the original selection mechanisms and major biological consequences of this human‐specific mutation remain uncertain, several interesting clues are currently being pursued. first, there is evidence that the human condition can explain differences in susceptibility or resistance to certain microbial pathogens. second, the functions of some endogenous receptors for sialic acids in the immune system may be altered by this difference. third, despite the lack of any obvious alternate pathway for synthesis, neu5gc has been reported in human tumors and possibly in human fetal tissues, and traces have even been detected in normal human tissues. one possible explanation is that this represents accumulation of neu5gc from dietary sources of animal origin. finally, a markedly reduced expression of hydroxylase in the brains of other mammals raises the possibility that the human‐specific mutation of this enzyme could have played a role in human brain evolution. yrbk phys anthropol 44:54–69, 2001. © 2001 wiley‐liss, inc.
objectives:reduced expression of dicer is associated with global downregulation of micrornas. primary dicer transcripts can be processed at two alternative polyadenylation sites, generating two pools of messenger rnas (mrnas) that carry either a long or a short 3′-untranslated regions (3′utrs), that both encode the same dicer protein. the short 3′utr dicer mrna is not regulated by mir-103/107. the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of total dicer mrna, long 3′utr dicer mrna, and mir-103 in colorectal cancer (crc).methods:paired tumor and normal mucosal specimens were obtained from 66 patients with crc. real-time reverse transcription pcr of long 3′utr dicer mrna, total dicer mrna and mir-103 was carried out using the taqman expression assay and the taqman microrna assay.results:the median expression level of coding dicer mrna in the tumors was significantly lower than that in normal mucosa (p<0.001). there was no significant difference in expression levels of long 3′utr dicer mrna between the tumors and the normal mucosa (p=0.90). the median expression ratio of long 3′utr dicer mrna to total dicer mrna in tumors was significantly higher than in normal mucosa (p<0.001). there was no significant difference in expression levels of mir-103 between the tumors and normal mucosa (p=0.17). there was no significant correlation between clinicopathological findings, such as stage, tumor location, and histological grade and expression levels of total dicer mrna, long 3′utr dicer mrna, or expression ratio of long 3′utr dicer mrna to total dicer mrna.conclusions:these results suggest that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional dysregulation of dicer expression may be involved in colon carcinogenesis. the current model for colorectal tumorigenesis defines four specific mutations (activation of a ras proto-oncogene and inactivation of the apc, p53 and dcc tumor-suppressor genes) that accumulate in a colonic epithelial cell as it progresses towards a carcinoma. however, further mutations must be needed for progression to malignancy because advanced adenomas have been observed with all four of these mutations. loss of heterozygosity (loh) for 11 loci spanning the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 14 was studied in 89 sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas and 25 adenomas. the overall rate of loh in carcinomas was 53% (46/86 informative carcinomas). the smallest region of overlap (sro) of deletions includes the markers d14s19 to d14s20. no loh was seen in the 18 informative adenomas examined. there was a significant trend towards higher levels of loh within the sro in advanced dukes' stages (p = 0.016). since frequent loss of heterozygosity in a specific region of a chromosome may reflect the inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene located there, these data suggest that a gene involved in the progression of colonic neoplasia may reside on the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 14, and that its inactivation may be a critical event in this process.
background: cisplatin has been associated with irreversible hearing damage. up to now, there is no therapeutic intervention showing benefit in preventing cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. the aim of this study was to determine risk factors contributing to hearing impairment after cisplatin administration in iranian patients. methods: hearing thresholds of 124 patients before and after cisplatin administration were assessed with reference to pure-tone audiometry averages at several frequencies from 2006 to 2010. mean values were calculated at each tested frequency in each ear at baseline and subsequent follow-up audiometry. hearing impairment was assessed with the münster score. results: the mean age at diagnosis and the median cumulative cisplatin dose were 47.3 years and 453.8 milligrams, respectively. bilateral hearing loss, mostly of grade 1, and tinnitus were detected in 26% and 3.2% of patients. logistic regression analysis showed that a high cumulative dose of cisplatin was the most important risk factor for developing hearing damage (p=0.034). the most significant changes in the status of the auditory system and the most severe threshold shift from base line (35 db) were observed at a frequency of 8 khz. also, patients who received higher individual doses of cisplatin showed significantly more tinnitus (p=0.002). conclusions: the results are testament to benefits of routine audiometric monitoring program during cisplatin-based chemotherapy. further research should be performed to understand other risk factors, such as genetic predictors of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. cisplatin is an effective chemotherapy agent against several pediatric malignancies. one of its side effects is irreversible sensorineural hearing damage that is highly variable with a reported incidence of 22–70%. the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and identify clinical predictors of cisplatin‐related ototoxicity.
backgroundalthough the treatment of parkinson’s disease (pd) is very effective, in the course of the disease, 40% to 60% of patients develop dyskinesias. the pathophysiology of dyskinesias is still unclear. results of preclinical research suggest that uptake and uncontrolled release of dopamine by serotonergic neurons is an important factor. based on this model, we hypothesized that dyskinesias will develop predominantly in pd patients with a relatively preserved serotonergic system.methodsbetween 1995 and 1998, 50 patients with early-stage untreated pd, diagnosed according to clinical criteria, and reduced striatal [123i]β-carboxymethyoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl) tropane (cit) single-photon emission computed tomography (spect) binding were recruited. to test our hypothesis, we retrospectively assessed baseline [123i]β-cit spect scans for striatal dopamine transporter (dat) and midbrain serotonin transporter (sert) availability as well as the sert-to-dat ratios. we compared these data between patients that developed dyskinesias and patients that did not develop dyskinesias during a mean follow-up of 14.2 years.resultsapproximately half of the pd patients developed dyskinesias. no differences in baseline [123i]β-cit dat availability, sert availability, or sert-to-dat ratios were found between the dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic group. the development of dyskinesias was most strongly associated with the age of onset (p = 0.002).conclusionssert-to-dat ratios in early-stage untreated pd do not correlate with the future development of dyskinesias. however, our study does not exclude the possibility that sert-to-dat ratios increase with disease progression in patients that develop dyskinesias because of a slower rate of degeneration of the serotonergic system. purposeacute monoamine depletion paradigms using alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (ampt) combined with single photon emission computed tomography (spect) have been used successfully to evaluate disturbances in central dopaminergic neurotransmission. however, severe side effects due to relatively high doses (4,500 to 8,000 mg) of ampt have been reasons for study withdrawal. thus, we assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of two alternative procedures, using lower doses of ampt.methodssix healthy subjects underwent three measurements of striatal dopamine d2 receptor (d2r)-binding potential (bpnd) with spect and the selective radiolabeled d2r antagonist [123i]ibzm. all subjects were scanned in the absence of pharmacological intervention (baseline) and after two different depletion procedures. in the first depletion session, over 6 h, subjects were administered 1,500 mg of ampt before scanning. in the second depletion session, over 25 h, subjects were administered 40 mg ampt/kg body weight. we also administered the subjective well-being under neuroleptic treatment scale, a self-report instrument designed to measure the subjective experience of patients on neuroleptic medication.resultswe found no change of mean d2r bpnd after the first and short ampt challenge compared to the baseline. however, we found a significant increase in striatal d2r bpnd binding after the ampt challenge adjusted for bodyweight compared to both other regimen. although subjective well-being worsened after the prolonged ampt challenge, no severe side effects were reported.conclusionsour results imply a low-dosage, suitable alternative to the common ampt procedure. the probability of side effects and study withdrawal can be reduced by this procedure.
a refined fdap approach is used to analyze tau’s behavior in axon-like processes. a conserved c-terminal pseudorepeat and disease-like pseudohyperphosphorylation critically influence tau’s microtubule interaction. the results contribute to an understanding of pathological processes that lead to tau’s redistribution during disease. during the development of neurons, the microtubule‐associated tau proteins show a graded proximo‐distal distribution in axons. in tauopathies such as alzheimer's disease, tau accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment. to scrutinize the determinants of tau's distribution and motion, we constructed photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (gfp)‐tagged tau fusion proteins and recorded their distribution after focal activation in living cells. simulation showed that the motion of tau was compatible with diffusion/reaction as opposed to active transport/reaction. effective diffusion constants of 0.7–0.8 μm2/second were calculated in neurites of pc12 cells and primary cortical neurons. furthermore, tau's amino terminal projection domain mediated binding and enrichment of tau at distal neurites indicating that the tip of a neurite acts as an adsorber trapping tau protein. treatment with taxol, incorporation of disease‐related tau modifications, experimentally induced hyperphosphorylation and addition of preaggregated amyloid β peptides (aβ) increased the effective diffusion constant compatible with a decreased binding to microtubules. distal enrichment was present after taxol treatment but was suppressed at disease‐relevant conditions. the data suggest that (i) dynamic binding of tau to microtubules and diffusion along microtubules and (ii) trapping at the tip of a neurite both contribute to its distribution during development and disease.
backgroundalexithymia, the difficulty in describing or recognizing emotions, has been associated with various psychosomatic pathologies including psoriasis. the aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of alexithymia and its association with anxiety and depression in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy participants, while taking into consideration demographic and clinical variables.methodsone hundred and eight psoriatic patients and 100 healthy participants from the general population completed the toronto alexithymia scale (tas-20) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads). the severity of patients’ psoriasis was clinically assessed using the psoriasis area and severity index (pasi).resultspsoriatic patients had higher levels of alexithymia compared with healthy participants. while a rather high rate of psoriatic patients presented anxiety and depression as defined by the hads, the differences that were found in comparison with the control group were not significant. neither alexithymia nor its dimensions, difficulty in identifying feelings (dif), difficulty in describing feelings (ddf) and externally oriented thinking (eot), were associated with gender or psoriasis severity. age was associated only with eot, which was independent of depression and anxiety. higher anxiety and depression were connected with higher alexithymia and dif, while higher anxiety with higher ddf as well.conclusionsthe alexithymia prevalence was higher in psoriatic patients than that in healthy participants, while it was positively correlated with anxiety and depression. difficulty in identifying feelings was connected with both anxiety and depression, whereas difficulty in describing them was only with anxiety. finally, externally oriented thinking was predicted only from age. introduction alexithymia was originally defined as the inability to recognize and verbalize emotions. it is characterized by an emptiness of feelings, poverty of imagination or of a life fantasy and difficulties in communicating with other people, as well as lack of positive emotions and a high prevalence of negative emotions. its presence has been incriminated in the genesis and in the maintenance of various psychosomatic pathologies. psoriasis, a frequent dermatitis, is classified among psychosomatic pathologies. in fact, the psychological dimension seems important, either in the appearance of the illness, in its evolution or in its prognosis.   aims of the study estimate the prevalence of alexithymia among patients with psoriasis. study the relationship between them. patients' characteristics: fifty-three patients with psoriasis consulted the dermatology department of the hedi chaker university hospital, in sfax, tunisia. patients' mean age was 42 years (min: 18 years; max: 76 years). the majority was married (58%), coming from middle to low social economic status (86%), and having a primary or secondary school level (84%). psoriasis was vulgar for 47 patients (89%) and pustular for the others (11%).   methodology we built a case-control study of 53 patients with psoriasis. the control group was formed of 53 subjects without psoriasis and paired according sex, age and school level. we evaluated psoriasis severity using the psoriasis area and severity index (pasi), a standardised instrument permitting assessment of the global severity of psoriasis. a cut off of 12 was used to diagnose severe psoriasis. alexithymia was assessed with the 20-item version of the toronto alexithymia scale (tas-20). this instrument has shown to be the best validated instrument for measuring alexithymia. a cut off of 61 was used to diagnose alexithymia. sociodemographical and clinical data were assessed by a questionnaire that was filled in by the doctor conducting the study. all analyses were performed using the spss version 11.0 and with a 95% confidence interval. differences in groups were tested using student's independent t-test, and chi-square.   results the mean score of alexithymia for the patients was 56 (e: 12.1). the mean score of alexithymia for the control group was 45 (e: 9.6). thirty-nine decimal six percent (n: 21) of patients and 13.2% (n: 7) of controls exhibited alexithymia. our results confirm the high prevalence of alexithymia among patients with psoriasis (39.6%) compared to controls (13.2%) (p: 0.0002, rr: 3.4). a stress factor was present before the apparition of psoriasis in half of the cases. psoriasis was severe in 50% of cases. women with psoriasis (and not men) presented severe psoriasis when they suffered from alexithymia (p: 0.049). the relationship between alexithymia and age was significant from the age of 40 (p: 0.024). the association between psoriasis and another psychosomatic diseases was significantly more important than for the controls (p: 0.03; rr: 4.6). psoriasis was not correlated to psychoactive substance (tobacco and alcohol, in our study). however, in the group of patients with alexithymia, alcohol consumption was associated with psoriasis severity (p: 0.05).   discussion in alexithymia, there is a risk that physical and emotional feelings will be used without distinction as signs of psychological distress, which can explain the somatic complaint due to the lack of the expression of psychological suffering. this can lead to the apparition of psoriasis. the relationship between psoriasis and alexithymia is increasingly studied in epidemiological surveys that use different instruments to measure alexithymia. however, the results of these surveys do not concord with ours. our results demonstrated a close link between the two conditions. moreover, the risk of further psychosomatic diseases increases in the presence of alexithymia. the consumption of alcohol was also high in cases of severe forms of psoriasis.   conclusion alexithymia does not appear to be a simple condition, related to psoriasis, but a worsening of the condition, exposing the patient to the association of other psychosomatic diseases and alcoholism, and thus worsening the global prognosis of these patients. the psychological approach, which favours the expression of emotions and permits a symbolic dimension, is as important as the biological approach, and necessary for the improvement of these patients.
the present study demonstrates the effect of fibrates, agonists of pparα on cytokines-induced proliferation in primary cultured astrocytes. alone or combination treatment with cytokines, such as il-1β (10 ng/ml), ifnγ (10 ng/ml), and tnf-α (10 ng/ml) cause a significant increase of cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner. treatment of astrocytes with bezafibrate and fenofibrate (0, 5, and 10 μm) reduced the ifnγ and il-1β-induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. to address the involvement of il-6 on the ifnγ and il-1β-induced cell proliferation, released il-6 level was measured. ifnγ and il-1β cause an increase of released il-6 protein level in a time-dependent manner. furthermore, pretreatment with il-6 antibody (0, 0.1, 1, 2.5, and 5 ng/ml) dose-dependently inhibited the ifnγ and il-1β-induced cell proliferation. however, bezafibrate and fenofibrate did not affect increased mrna and protein levels of il-6 in ifnγ and il-1β-stimulated astrocytes. taken together, these results clearly suggest that activation of pparα attenuates the ifnγ and il-1β-induced cell proliferation through il-6 independent pathway. the il-12 family of cytokines, which include il-12, il-23, and il-27, play critical roles in the differentiation of th1 cells and are believed to contribute to the development of multiple sclerosis (ms) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), an animal model of ms. relatively little is known concerning the expression of il-12 family cytokines by cells of the cns, the affected tissue in ms. previously, we and others demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-γ agonists suppress the development of eae, alter t cell proliferation and phenotype, and suppress the activation of apcs. the present studies demonstrated that ppar-γ agonists, including the naturally occurring 15-deoxy-δ12,14-pgj2 and the synthetic thiazoladinedione rosiglitazone, inhibited the induction of il-12p40, il-12p70 (p35/p40), il-23 (p19/p40), and il-27p28 proteins by lps-stimulated primary microglia. in primary astrocytes, lps induced the production of il-12p40, il-23, and il-27p28 proteins. however, il-12p70 production was not detected in these cells. the 15-deoxy-δ12,14-pgj2 potently suppressed il-12p40, il-23, and il-27p28 production by primary astrocytes, whereas rosiglitazone suppressed il-23 and il-27p28, but not il-12p40 in these cells. these novel observations suggest that ppar-γ agonists modulate the development of eae, at least in part, by inhibiting the production of il-12 family cytokines by cns glia. in addition, we demonstrate that ppar-γ agonists inhibit tlr2, myd88, and cd14 expression in glia, suggesting a possible mechanism by which these agonists modulate il-12 family cytokine expression. collectively, these studies suggest that ppar-γ agonists may be beneficial in the treatment of ms.
objective to provide prognostic information from a large cohort of women with granulosa cell tumor we analyzed the national cancer database.   methods we performed an observational retrospective cohort analysis of 2680 women with ovarian granulosa cell tumor from the 1998-2013 national cancer database. kaplan-meier and multivariable cox proportional-hazards survival analyses were performed for the overall cohort and propensity score matched cohorts to examine the association of surgical staging and adjuvant chemotherapy with survival. a random forest was used to determine important prognostic factors in stages ii-iv granulosa cell tumor.   results adjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy were not associated with survival. older age, more comorbidities, prior malignancy, higher stage, poor differentiation, larger tumor size, incomplete surgical staging, and residual disease at a surgical margin were independently associated with increased hazard of death. among women with stage i disease, each one centimeter increase in tumor size was associated with 4% (2-6%) increased hazard of death (p<0.001). by matched cohort analyses, the hazard ratio (hr) (95% ci) for death associated with incomplete surgical staging was 1.77 (1.30-2.41), p<0.001 among women with stage i disease. receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with increased survival among women with stages ii-iv disease compared to no adjuvant treatment.   conclusion incomplete surgical staging was associated with increased hazard of death. there was no evidence of increased survival with use of adjuvant chemotherapy. early and complete surgical resection remains the best evidenced treatment for ovarian granulosa cell tumor. objective to analyze the role of surgical staging and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with adult type granulosa cell tumor (gct) of the ovary.   methods patients were divided into those with early-stage (stages i-ii, n=93) and advanced-stage (stages iii-iv, n=13) gct and analyzed separately in this retrospective study.   results of the 93 patients with early-stage gct, 30 were completely staged and 25 underwent lymph node dissection. after surgery, 17 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin (bep). none had lymph node metastasis. completely staged patients had no recurrence or deaths. however, recurrences were observed in 9 of 63 patients (14.3%) who did not undergo complete staging, with four (6.3%) dying due to disease. the 5-year disease-free survival (dfs) rates of groups with and without complete staging were 100% and 84%, respectively (p=0.037). adjuvant chemotherapy was not significantly associated with dfs (p=0.193). all patients with advanced-stage gct underwent optimal cytoreduction and received adjuvant chemotherapy with bep. none of the 6 patients who completed 6 cycles of bep had recurrence, whereas 5 of the 7 patients (71.4%) who received fewer than 6 cycles of bep had recurrences and 3 (42.9%) died due to disease. the 5-year dfs rates of these two groups were 100% and 50%, respectively (p=0.022), with cycles of chemotherapy being the only significant factor for dfs in patients with advanced-stage gct.   conclusions complete surgical staging is recommended, but lymph node removal is not recommended for early-stage gct. optimal debulking followed by six cycles of bep chemotherapy is recommended for advanced-stage gct.
the purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of two doses of photobiomodulation (pbm) on inflammatory parameters including cell migration and oxidative stress in carrageenan-induced peritonitis models. twenty-eight mice were divided into four groups: saline; untreated carrageenan (cg; inflammation induced); and pmb treatment groups l1 and l5 (inflammation induced with carrageenan followed by laser irradiation at 1 and 5 j/cm2, respectively). after 30 min of inducing inflammation, laser irradiation was administered every hour, for 4 h. peritoneal fluid was collected for analyses. the total leukocyte number in the peritoneal fluid in l1 (4.33 ± 2.34) and l5 (4.95 ± 2.86) after pbm was lower than that in cg (10.93 ± 5.15 cells/ml). the average differential count of neutrophils in the cg was 9.46 ± 4.31 cells/ml, which was higher than that in l1 (3.7 ± 2.08) and l5 (4.94 ± 2.57). myeloperoxidase activity was also lower in l1 (1.89 ± 0.43) and l5 (4.84 ± 2.62) than in cg (22.92 ± 4.52 umpo/ml). malondialdehyde content was lower in l1 (137.5 ± 12.33) and l5 (169.6 ± 22.77) than in cg (345.7 ± 65.67 nmol/ml). glutathione peroxidase concentration was significantly higher in l1 (155.2 ± 12.43) and l5 (145.9 ± 9.585) than in cg (79.75 ± 9.567 μ/ml). nitrite concentration was lower in l1 (0.3317 μm ± 0.0669) and l5 (0.2429 μm ± 0.0232) than in cg (0.8380 μm ± 0.01615). laser irradiation at 1 and 5 j/cm2 reversed the inflammation (as indicated by neutrophil infiltration and oxidative stress). arthritis of the knee is the most common type of joint inflammatory disorder and it is associated with pain and inflammation of the joint capsule. few studies address the effects of the 810-nm laser in such conditions. here we investigated the effects of low-level laser therapy (lllt; infrared, 810-nm) in experimentally induced rat knee inflammation. thirty male wistar rats (230–250 g) were anesthetized and injected with carrageenan by an intra-articular route. after 6 and 12 h, all animals were killed by co2 inhalation and the articular cavity was washed for cellular and biochemical analysis. articular tissue was carefully removed for real-time pcr analysis in order to evaluate cox-1 and cox-2 expression. lllt was able to significantly inhibit the total number of leukocytes, as well as the myeloperoxidase activity with 1, 3, and 6 j (joules) of energy. this result was corroborated by cell counting showing the reduction of polymorphonuclear cells at the inflammatory site. vascular extravasation was significantly inhibited at the higher dose of energy of 10 j. both cox-1 and 2 gene expression were significantly enhanced by laser irradiation while pge2 production was inhibited. low-level laser therapy operating at 810 nm markedly reduced inflammatory signs of inflammation but increased cox-1 and 2 gene expression. further studies are necessary to investigate the possible production of antiinflammatory mediators by cox enzymes induced by laser irradiation in knee inflammation.
lisy, ondrej, michihisa jougasaki, john a. schirger, horng h. chen, paul t. barclay, and john c. burnett, jr. neutral endopeptidase inhibition potentiates the natriuretic actions of adrenomedullin. am. j. physiol. 275 (renal physiol. 44): f410–f414, 1998.—adrenomedullin (adm) is a potent renal vasodilating and natriuretic peptide possessing a six amino acid disulfide ring. neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (nep) is localized in greatest abundance in the kidney and cleaves endogenous peptides like atrial natriuretic peptide, which also possesses a disulfide ring. we hypothesized that nep inhibition potentiates the natriuretic actions of exogenous adm in anesthetized dogs (n 5 6). we therefore investigated renal function in which one kidney received intrarenal infusion of adm (1 ng·kg21 ·min21) while the contralateral kidney served as control before and during the systemic infusion of a nep inhibitor (candoxatrilat, 8 μg·kg21 ·min21; pfizer). in response to adm, glomerular filtration rate (gfr) in the adm kidney did not change, whereas renal blood flow, urine flow (uv), and urinary sodium excretion (unav) increased from baseline. proximal and distal fractional reabsorption of sodium decreased in the adm-infused kidney. in response to systemic nep inhibition, unav and uv increased further in the adm kidney. indeed, dunav and duv were markedly greater in the adm kidney compared with the control kidney. plasma adm was unchanged during adm infusion but increased during nep inhibition. in conclusion, the present investigation is the first to demonstrate that nep inhibition potentiates the natriuretic and diuretic responses to intrarenal adm. this potentiation occurs secondary to a decrease in tubular sodium reabsorption. lastly, the increase in plasma adm during systemic nep inhibition supports the conclusion that adm is a substrate for nep. in order to elucidate the role of adrenomedullin in the kidney, we investigated the effects of adrenomedullin on renal hemodynamics and urine formation in anesthetized dogs. intrarenal arterial infusion of adrenomedullin (0.8, 4 and 20 ng.kg-1.min-1) elicited dose-dependent increases in renal blood flow (by 10, 26 and 37%, respectively) with no change in blood pressure or heart rate, indicating a renal vasodilatory action of adrenomedullin. the glomerular filtration rate did not increase with the lower two doses, but increased marginally by 9% at the highest dose. infusion of adrenomedullin at the rates of 4 and 20 ng.kg-1.min-1 increased urine flow and the urinary excretion of sodium and potassium dose dependently. arterial and renal venous plasma renin activity was unaffected by adrenomedullin. these findings indicate that adrenomedullin is a potent renal vasodilatory peptide with a diuretic action. since the threshold for the renal vasodilatory action of adrenomedullin is close to its physiological concentration in human plasma, adrenomedullin may play an important role in the regulation of renal function.
purpose: a review of posterior capsule opacification (pco) after cataract surgery and some affecting factors methods: a cross-sectional study was designed to study cataract patients who underwent cataract surgery between 2003 and 2006 in farabi eye hospital, tehran, iran. random sampling was done. those with a history of uveitis, intraocular surgery, and eye trauma were excluded from the study. the patients were then invited for follow-up visits and study of the results. postsurgical pco percentage was calculated, and its association with variables like sex, age, history of cataract surgery, type of surgery, and type of lens was studied. results: the incidence of pco in patients was 14.2% (11.3 to 17.0 ci=95%) with an incidence of 8.7% and 19.9% in males and females, respectively (p<0.001). pco was not significantly correlated with age. the incidence of pco in those who had undergone cataract surgery at least one year ago was 10.9% while it was 22.7% in those who had received surgery at least 4 years ago (p=0.005). pco incidence in those with and without partial opacity was 31% and 13.2%, respectively (p=0.011). the highest and lowest incidence of pco belonged to those who were operated on with small incision cataract surgery (sics) and phacoemulsification techniques, respectively (p=0.009). the incidence of pco was 24.2% and 12% in cases in whom pmma and foldable lenses were used, respectively (p=0.002). of those with pco after cataract surgery, 31.6% (21.5 to 41.8 ci=95%) needed nd:yag laser capsulotomy. conclusion: in our study, the incidence of pco after cataract surgery was relatively low with a higher incidence in females. preoperative corneal opacity, surgical technique and the lens type can be factors affecting the incidence of pco. a complication of extracapsular cataract extraction with or without posterior chamber intraocular lens (pc-iol) implantation is posterior capsule opacification. this condition is usually secondary to a proliferation and migration of residual lens epithelial cells. opacification may be reduced by atraumatic surgery and thorough cortical clean-up. clinical, pathological and experimental studies have shown that use of hydrodissection, the continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis and specific iol designs may help reduce the incidence of this complication. capsular-fixated, one-piece all-polymethylmethacrylate pc-iols with a c-shaped loop configuration and a posterior convexity of the optic are effective. polymethylmethacrylate loops that retain "memory" create a symmetric, radial stretch on the posterior capsule after in-the-bag placement, leading to a more complete contact between the posterior surface of the iol optic and the taut capsule. this may help form a barrier against central migration of epithelial cells into the visual axis. various pharmacological and immunological methods are being investigated but conclusive data on these modalities are not yet available.
this study tested the hypothesis that the modulation of cutaneous reflexes during human cycling would be dependent on muscle biomechanical function and phase of leg movement. the coupling between neuromuscular (electromyographic, emg), kinetic and kinematic responses to brief innocuous (75% of the pain threshold pnt) and noxious (125% pnt) sural nerve stimulation were studied. stimuli were delivered pseudorandomly at eight equidistant (45°) positions of the crank cycle. peak ipsilateral middle latency emg reflex responses were calculated between 70 and 130 ms post stimulus in biceps femoris (bf), rectus femoris (rf), tibialis anterior (ta) and soleus (sol). peak torque, knee and ankle joint angle changes were calculated between 140 and 220 ms post stimulus to quantify net kinetic and kinematic reflex modulation. reflex responses were predominately suppressive during early activation of all muscles and facilitatory during bf and ta muscle inactivation. emg reflex responses in monoarticular lower leg muscles ta and sol were well correlated with ankle angle in dorsi/plantaflexion, whereas the correlation between reflex modulation in biarticular upper leg muscles (bf and rf) and knee angle changes in flexion/extension was weaker. stimulation provoked significant ankle eversion over the whole crank cycle for both stimulus intensities, which was correlated with ta and bf emg reflex responses. torque modulation followed emg and kinematic changes in a movement phase-dependent manner. reflex magnitude was stimulation intensity-dependent. supplementary nociceptive activation may contribute for this increase. we conclude that sural nerve stimulation during human cycling evokes distinct reflex responses in muscles operating around the knee (bf and rf) and the ankle (ta and sol). these reflexes are modulated in a phase-dependent manner depending on muscle biomechanical function to generate energy for limb and crank propulsion during a specific region in the cycle. this modulation contributed to a specific adaptation of joint motion and force production in order to maintain task performance. 1. the phase-dependent modulation of medium-latency (p2) (70-80 ms) responses in semitendinosus (st), biceps femoris (bf), rectus femoris (rf), and tibialis anterior (ta) was studied with the use of low-intensity stimulation (2 times perception threshold) of the sural nerve. the shocks were given in a random order at 16 phases of the step cycle in 10 normal subjects during forward walking (fw) or backward walking (bw) on a treadmill. 2. all subjects exhibited p2 responses in all muscles studied both during bw and fw. the amplitude of the facilitatory p2 responses showed phase-dependent changes that could not have been predicted on the basis of the variations in background activity throughout the step cycle. 3. during fw, the p2 facilitatory responses in bf were large (with respect to the background activity) throughout the whole step cycle except for a short period near the end of the swing phase. in st the responses were smaller and appeared primarily at the end of the stance phase and during the first part of the swing phase. during the second half of swing the p2 responses were basically suppressive. a modulation pattern similar to the one in st was found in rf and ta, except that there was no reversal to suppressive responses in the swing phase in rf. instead, a reduction in the amplitude of the facilitatory p2 responses occurred. 4. during bw, the modulation pattern recorded in the same subjects was different from the one seen during fw. large facilitatory p2 responses were present in all muscles in middle and late swing. in the first half of stance the responses were most prominently seen in bf and rf. at the end of stance and/or at the onset of swing the facilitatory responses decreased in amplitude (bf and rf) or reversed to p2 suppressions (st and ta). 5. we conclude that there are both facilitatory and suppressive pathways from the sural nerve to the leg muscles studied and that the balance of activity in these paths is phase dependent during both fw and bw. it is suggested that the phase-dependent modulation of p2 responses could largely rely on a central motor program. during bw the same motor program is used as during fw, but possibly running in reverse, thereby causing a shift both in the timing of the reflex reversal and in the periods of reflex suppression.
background in the human visual system, different attributes of an object, such as shape, color, and motion, are processed separately in different areas of the brain. this raises a fundamental question of how are these attributes integrated to produce a unified perception and a specific response. this “binding problem” is computationally difficult because all attributes are assumed to be bound together to form a single object representation. however, there is no firm evidence to confirm that such representations exist for general objects. methodology/principal findings here we propose a paired-attribute model in which cognitive processes are based on multiple representations of paired attributes. in line with the model's prediction, we found that multiattribute stimuli can produce an illusory perception of a multiattribute object arising from erroneous integration of attribute pairs, implying that object recognition is based on parallel perception of paired attributes. moreover, in a change-detection task, a feature change in a single attribute frequently caused an illusory perception of change in another attribute, suggesting that multiple pairs of attributes are stored in memory. conclusions/significance the paired-attribute model can account for some novel illusions and controversial findings on binocular rivalry and short-term memory. our results suggest that many cognitive processes are performed at the level of paired attributes rather than integrated objects, which greatly facilitates the binding problem and provides simpler solutions for it. previous research has suggested that visual short-term memory has a fixed capacity of about four objects. however, we found that capacity varied substantially across the five stimulus classes we examined, ranging from 1.6 for shaded cubes to 4.4 for colors (estimated using a change detection task). we also estimated the information load per item in each class, using visual search rate. the changes we measured in memory capacity across classes were almost exactly mirrored by changes in the opposite direction in visual search rate (r2 = .992 between search rate and the reciprocal of memory capacity). the greater the information load of each item in a stimulus class (as indicated by a slower search rate), the fewer items from that class one can hold in memory. extrapolating this linear relationship reveals that there is also an upper bound on capacity of approximately four or five objects. thus, both the visual information load and number of objects impose capacity limits on visual short-term memory.
in healthy people, a preference in attention maintenance and memory for words with emotional valence comparing to neutral words has been shown. the pattern of emotional stimuli processing may be different in people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mtle) and it may be sensitive to the presence of depressive symptoms. in order to explore these possibilities, we applied the emotional spatial cueing attentional task and the free recall memory task to participants (n=39) with mtle and compared them with healthy controls. we hypothesized that the pattern of maintaining attention and remembering emotional words is different in people with mtle. current literature indicates that this pattern will change from positive bias in the controls, though no emotional bias in the participants with mtle without depression (mtle-d), and in this work we examined this pattern in the participants with mtle with depressive symptoms (mtle+d). our results show that in both attention and memory, control subjects exhibit positive emotional bias, the subjects with mtle-d show nonemotional bias and the subjects with mtle+d have bias away from positive words. participants with mtle+d maintained attention for positive words shorter than others. participants with mtle+d had worse recall for positive words than the participants with mtle-d and for all words when compared to controls. we found that faster attention disengagement from positive words and worse memory for positive words is associated with elevated levels of depressive symptoms. background excessive chronic drinking is accompanied by a broad spectrum of emotional changes ranging from apathy and emotional flatness to deficits in comprehending emotional information, but their neural bases are poorly understood.   methods emotional abnormalities associated with alcoholism were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging in abstinent long-term alcoholic men in comparison to healthy demographically matched controls. participants were presented with emotionally valenced words and photographs of faces during deep (semantic) and shallow (perceptual) encoding tasks followed by recognition.   results overall, faces evoked stronger activation than words, with the expected material-specific laterality (left hemisphere for words, and right for faces) and depth of processing effects. however, whereas control participants showed stronger activation in the amygdala and hippocampus when viewing faces with emotional (relative to neutral) expressions, the alcoholics responded in an undifferentiated manner to all facial expressions. in the alcoholic participants, amygdala activity was inversely correlated with an increase in lateral prefrontal activity as a function of their behavioral deficits. prefrontal modulation of emotional function as a compensation for the blunted amygdala activity during a socially relevant face appraisal task is in agreement with a distributed network engagement during emotional face processing.   conclusions deficient activation of amygdala and hippocampus may underlie impaired processing of emotional faces associated with long-term alcoholism and may be a part of the wide array of behavioral problems including disinhibition, concurring with previously documented interpersonal difficulties in this population. furthermore, the results suggest that alcoholics may rely on prefrontal rather than temporal limbic areas in order to compensate for reduced limbic responsivity and to maintain behavioral adequacy when faced with emotionally or socially challenging situations.
objective to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ccl13/monocyte chemoattractant protein 4 (mcp-4) chemokine expression through proinflammatory cytokines in different primary human fibroblasts and the contribution of ccl13 to monocyte migration.   methods using rnase protection assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we quantified the expression of ccl13 compared with that of ccl2/mcp-1 in primary human fibroblasts. boyden chamber assays were performed to determine the importance of ccl13 for migration of primary monocytes. pharmacologic inhibitors as well as small interfering rna knockdown approaches were used to investigate the signaling pathways regulating ccl13 expression.   results the interleukin-6 (il-6)-type cytokine oncostatin m (osm) was a powerful inducer of ccl13 expression in primary synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) as well as those from healthy control subjects but not in other types of fibroblasts. neither il-6 nor tumor necrosis factor alpha could stimulate the expression of ccl13 in synovial fibroblasts; il-1beta was a very weak inducer. synovial fibroblasts from patients with ra constitutively produced low amounts of ccl13, which was partially dependent on constitutive production of osm. by investigating the underlying molecular mechanism, we identified stat-5, erk-1/2, and p38 as critical factors involved in osm-dependent transcription and messenger rna stabilization of ccl13.   conclusion in contrast to other prominent cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of ra, osm can strongly up-regulate the expression of ccl13, a chemokine recently identified in the synovial fluid of patients with ra. despite potent osm-induced signal transduction in all types of fibroblasts analyzed, only synovial fibroblasts secreted ccl13, which might be indicative of tissue-specific imprinting of different fibroblasts during development. we investigated the extent to which fibroblasts isolated from diverse tissues differ in their capacity to modulate inflammation by comparing the global gene expression profiles of cultured human fibroblasts from skin, acute and chronically inflamed synovium, lymph node and tonsil. the responses of these fibroblasts to tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma and il-4 stimulation were markedly different, as revealed by hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis. in the absence of exogenous cytokine, synovial and skin fibroblasts exhibited similar patterns of gene expression. however their transcriptional profiles diverged upon treatment with tnf-alpha. this proved to be biologically relevant, as tnf-alpha induced the secretion of different patterns and amounts of il-6, il-8 and ccl2 (mcp-1) in the two fibroblast types. co-culture of skin or synovial fibroblasts with synovial fluid-derived mononuclear cells provided further evidence that these transcriptional differences were functionally significant in an ex vivo setting. interestingly, the transcriptional response of skin fibroblasts to il-4 converged with that of tnf-alpha-treated synovial fibroblasts, suggesting resident tissue fibroblasts and their blood-borne precursors may be imprinted by inflammatory cytokines that are characteristic of different tissues. our data supports the concept that fibroblasts are heterogeneous, and that they contribute to the tissue-specificity of inflammatory reactions. fibroblasts are therefore likely to play an active role in the persistence of chronic inflammatory reactions.
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) of human primary motor cortex (m1) changes cortical excitability at the site of stimulation and at distant sites without affecting simple motor performance. the aim of this study was to explore how rtms changes regional excitability and how the motor system compensates for these changes. using functional brain imaging, activation was mapped at rest and during freely selected finger movements after 30 min of 1 hz rtms. rtms increased synaptic activity in the stimulated left m1 and induced widespread changes in activity throughout areas engaged by the task. in particular, movement-related activity in the premotor cortex of the nonstimulated hemisphere increased after 1 hz rtms. analyses of effective connectivity confirmed that the stimulated part of m1 became less responsive to input from premotor and mesial motor areas. conversely, after rtms our results were consistent with increased coupling between an inferomedial portion of left m1 and anterior motor areas. these results are important for three reasons. first, they show changes in motor excitability to central inputs from other cortical areas (as opposed to peripheral or exogenous inputs used in previous studies). second, they suggest that maintenance of task performance may involve activation of premotor areas contralateral to the site of rtms, similar to that seen in stroke patients. third, changes in motor activations at the site of rtms suggest an rtms-induced remodeling of motor representations during movement. this remapping may provide a neural substrate for acute compensatory plasticity of the motor system in response to focal lesions such as stroke. we studied the effects of low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) on motor cortex excitability in humans. tms at 0.1 hz for 1 hour did not change cortical excitability. stimulation at 0.9 hz for 15 minutes (810 pulses), similar to the parameters used to induce long-term depression (ltd) in cortical slice preparations and in vivo animal studies, led to a mean decrease in motor evoked potential (mep) amplitude of 19.5%. the decrease in cortical excitability lasted for at least 15 minutes after the end of the 0.9 hz stimulation. the mechanism underlying this decrease in excitability may be similar to ltd. tms-induced reduction of cortical excitability has potential clinical applications in diseases such as epilepsy and myoclonus. spread of excitation, which may be a warning sign for seizures, occurred in one subject and was not accompanied by increased mep amplitude, suggesting that spread of excitation and amplitude changes are different phenomena and also indicating the need for adequate monitoring even with stimulations at low frequencies.
this paper studies the problem of discovering the structured knowledge representation of binary natural language relations. the representation, known as the schema, generalizes the traditional path of predicates to support more complex semantics. we present a search algorithm to generate schemas over a knowledge base, and propose a data-driven learning approach to discover the most suitable representations to one relation. evaluation results show that inferred schemas are able to represent precise semantics, and can be used to enrich manually crafted knowledge bases. 1 learning embeddings of entities and relations is an efficient and versatile method to perform machine learning on relational data such as knowledge graphs. in this work, we propose holographic embeddings (hole) to learn compositional vector space representations of entire knowledge graphs. the proposed method is related to holographic models of associative memory in that it employs circular correlation to create compositional representations. by using correlation as the compositional operator, hole can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. experimentally, we show that holographic embeddings are able to outperform state-of-the-art methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs and relational learning benchmark datasets.
background in the adult brain, migrating neuroblasts can replace damaged neurons after severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). little is known about which factors determine the magnitude and amplification of neurogenesis after tbi, but there are some evidences that the nerve growth factor (ngf) and the doublecortin (dcx) can influence neurogenesis and neuronal repair.   methods this study investigates the ngf and dcx levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of 12 children with severe tbi and 12 matched controls, to determine the correlation between the expression of both these factors and the patients outcome. we collected cerebrospinal fluid samples 2 hours (time t1) and 48 hours (time t2) after brain injury. ngf levels were measured using a two-site immunoenzymatic assay, whereas the dcx expression by a western blot analysis.   results at time t1 and t2, children with the best outcomes had higher levels of ngf than children with poor outcomes. evaluating the change of ngf levels from time t1 to time t2, we found that the ngf up-regulation in the early time after injury was significantly associated with good outcomes of patients. concomitantly, the expression of dcx increased only in patients with ngf up-regulation from time t1 to time t2. in others patients and in controls the expression of dcx remained unchanged.   conclusion based on these results, we hypothesize that ngf and dcx contribute to the mechanisms of neuroprotection and neuronal connection reorganization after tbi, playing a key role in the outcome of these patients. nerve growth factor (ngf) was discovered 50 years ago as a molecule that promoted the survival and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic neurons. its roles in neural development have been characterized extensively, but recent findings point to an unexpected diversity of ngf actions and indicate that developmental effects are only one aspect of the biology of ngf. this article considers expanded roles for ngf that are associated with the dynamically regulated production of ngf and its receptors that begins in development, extends throughout adult life and aging, and involves a surprising variety of neurons, glia, and nonneural cells. particular attention is given to a growing body of evidence that suggests that among other roles, endogenous ngf signaling subserves neuroprotective and repair functions. the analysis points to many interesting unanswered questions and to the potential for continuing research on ngf to substantially enhance our understanding of the mechanisms and treatment of neurological disorders.
terahertz electromagnetic fields are non-ionizing electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 0.1 to 10 thz. potential applications of these electromagnetic fields include the whole body scanners, which currently apply millimeter waves just below the terahertz range, but future scanners will use higher frequencies in the terahertz range. these and other applications will bring along human exposure to these fields. up to now, only a limited number of investigations on biological effects of terahertz electromagnetic fields have been performed. therefore, research is strongly needed to enable reliable risk assessment. cells were exposed for 2 h, 8 h, and 24 h with different power intensities ranging from 0.04 mw/cm2 to 2 mw/cm2, representing levels below, at, and above current safety limits. genomic damage on the chromosomal level was measured as micronucleus formation. dna strand breaks and alkali-labile sites were quantified with the comet assay. no dna strand breaks or alkali-labile sites were observed as a consequence of exposure to terahertz electromagnetic fields in the comet assay. the fields did not cause chromosomal damage in the form of micronucleus induction. emerging technologies are considering the possible use of terahertz radiation in different fields ranging from telecommunications to biology and biomedicine. the study of the potential effects of terahertz radiation on biological systems is therefore an important issue in order to safely develop a variety of applications. this paper describes a pilot study devoted to determine if terahertz radiation could induce genotoxic effects in human peripheral blood leukocytes. for this purpose, human whole blood samples from healthy donors were exposed for 20 min to terahertz radiation. since, to our knowledge, this is the first study devoted to the evaluation of possible genotoxic effects of such radiation, different electromagnetic conditions were considered. in particular, the frequencies of 120 and 130 ghz were chosen: the first one was tested at a specific absorption rate (sar) of 0.4 mw g−1, while the second one was tested at sar levels of 0.24, 1.4, and 2 mw g−1. chromosomal damage was evaluated by means of the cytokinesis block micronucleus technique, which also gives information on cell cycle kinetics. moreover, human whole blood samples exposed to 130 ghz at sar levels of 1.4 and 2 mw g−1 were also tested for primary dna damage by applying the alkaline comet assay immediately after exposure. the results obtained indicate that thz exposure, in the explored electromagnetic conditions, is not able to induce either genotoxicity or alteration of cell cycle kinetics in human blood cells from healthy subjects.
stéphane helleringer and colleagues conducted a validation study in niakhar, senegal to investigate whether a new approach, sibling survival calendars, improves the quality of adult mortality data collected in demographic surveys. please see later in the article for the editors' summary this study examines heaping of reported durations of three postpartum variables in five countries based on two methods of data collection in retrospective surveys. two demographic and health surveys were conducted for each of the countries, one that used a five-year month-by-month calendar to record the durations and a subsequent survey in which duration information was collected from simple questions in the body of the questionnaire. heaping indexes were calculated for breastfeeding, amenorrhea, and abstinence at six, 12, 18, and 24 months postpartum. use of the calendar was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of heaped responses for both breastfeeding and amenorrhea, and the effect increased for longer durations. to obtain more accurate information about these variables, the authors recommend the use of the calendar.
purposeto quantify blastocyst morphologic parameters with a feasible and standardized tool, investigating their predictive value on implantation outcome.methodthe study retrospectively analyzes 124 blastocysts from 75 patients. quantitative measurements of blastocyst expansion, inner cell mass and trophoectoderm were taken using digital image analysis software.result(s)blastocysts areas were found to be ranging from 11626.2 up to 35076.4 μm2. the area of an early blastocyst is a ≤ 18500 μm2 with a mean diameter d = 140 ± 9 μm, and the area of an expanded blastocyst is a ≥ 24000 with d = 190 ± 9 μm. while blastocyst mean area was not related to implantation rate, more expanded blastocysts displayed a significantly higher implantation rate. trophoectoderm cell number is a predictor of positive outcome: since a higher of cells (25.6 ± 11.3 vs 16.3 ± 12.8) `forming a tightly knit epithelium is prognostic of implantation potential. conversely, inner cell mass size is significantly related to implantation only in expanded blastocysts (3122.7 ± 739.0 vs. 2978.1 ± 366.0 μm2).conclusion(s)evaluation of blastocyst morphology with a digital image system could be a valuable tool to standardize blastocyst grading based on quantitative parameters. therefore, digital analysis may be helpful in identifying the best blastocyst to transfer. objective to investigate the predictive value of quantitative measurements of blastocyst morphology on subsequent implantation rates after transfer.   design prospective observational study.   setting private assisted reproductive technology center.   patient(s) one hundred seventy-four ivf patients receiving transfers of expanded blastocyst-stage embryos on day 5 (n = 112) or day 6 (n = 62) after oocyte retrieval.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) blastocyst diameter, number of trophectoderm cells, inner cell mass (icm) size, icm shape, and implantation and pregnancy rates.   result(s) blastocyst diameter and trophectoderm cell numbers were unrelated to implantation rates. day 5 expanded blastocysts with icms of >4,500 microm(2) implanted at a higher rate than did those with smaller icms (55% vs. 31%). day 5 expanded blastocysts with slightly oval icms implanted at a higher rate (58%) compared with those with either rounder icms (7%) or more elongated icms (33%). implantation rates were highest (71%) for embryos with both optimal icm size and shape. pregnancy rates were higher for day 5 transfers of optimally shaped icms compared with day 5 transfers of optimally sized icms.   conclusion(s) quantitative measurements of the inner cell mass are highly indicative of blastocyst implantation potential. blastocysts with relatively large and/or slightly oval icms are more likely to implant than other blastocysts.
abstract background: maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) has not been previously studied in ukraine. we investigated the genetic etiology in a selected cohort of patients with diabetes diagnosed before 18 years of age, and in their family members. methods: genetic testing of the most prevalent mody genes (gck, hnf1a, hnf4a, hnf1b and ins) was undertaken for 36 families (39 affected individuals) by sanger or targeted next generation sequencing. results: a genetic diagnosis of mody was made in 15/39 affected individuals from 12/36 families (33%). hnf1a and hnf4a mody were the most common subtypes, accounting for 9/15 of mody cases. eight patients with hnf1a or hnf4a mody and inadequate glycemic control were successfully transferred to sulfonylureas. median hba1c decreased from 67 mmol/mol (range 58–69) to 47 mmol/mol (range 43–50) (8.3% [7.5–8.5] to 6.4% [6.1–6.7]) 3 months after transfer (p=0.006). conclusions: genetic testing identified pathogenic hnf1a and hnf4a variants as the most common cause of mody in ukraine. transfer to sulfonylureas substantially improved the glycemic control of these patients. aims/hypothesismaturity-onset diabetes of the young is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. a correct diagnosis of mody is important for determining treatment, but can only be confirmed by molecular genetic testing. we aimed to compare the regional distribution of confirmed mody cases in the uk and to estimate the minimum prevalence.methodsuk referrals for genetic testing in 2,072 probands and 1,280 relatives between 1996 and 2009 were examined by region, country and test result. referral rate and prevalence were calculated using uk census 2001 figures.resultsmody was confirmed in 1,177 (35%) patients, with hnf1a (52%) and gck mutations (32%) being most frequent in probands confirmed with mody. there was considerable regional variation in proband referral rates (from <20 per million in wales and northern ireland to >50 per million for south west england and scotland) and patients diagnosed with mody (5.3 per million in northern ireland, 48.9 per million in south west england). referral rates and confirmed cases were highly correlated (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001). the minimum prevalence of mody was estimated to be 108 cases per million.conclusions/interpretationassuming this minimal prevalence throughout the uk then >80% of mody is not diagnosed by molecular testing. the marked regional variation in the prevalence of confirmed mody directly results from differences in referral rates. this could reflect variation in awareness of mody or unequal access to genetic testing. increased referral for diagnostic testing is required if the majority of mody patients are to have the genetic diagnosis necessary for optimal treatment.
introduction hyperhomocysteinemia has been linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by numerous authors. whether this association is causal or not remains uncertain. the aim of the study was to investigate the association of hyperhomocysteinemia with the degree of carotid atherosclerosis in stroke patients. methods we studied 97 greek patients in our stroke unit who were hospitalized as a result of ischemic stroke between march 2006 and may 2007. the patients were divided into two groups: the first (52 patients) included stroke patients with serum levels of homocysteine below 15 μmol/l, but in the second group (45 patients) serum homocysteine exceeded this value. we measured carotid intima-media thickness (cimt) in all patients and correlated it with serum homocysteine. results the mean homocysteine concentration was 11.5 μmol/l in the first group and 21.5 μmol/l in the second group. carotid imt was 1.012 mm in the first group, and 1.015 mm in the second group, an insignificant difference. on the contrary, serum folate concentration was 21.3 nmol/l in the first group compared with 16.7 nmol/l in the second group (p < 0.001). vitb12 was 401 pmol/l in the first group and 340 pmol/l in the second group, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). conclusions serum levels of homocysteine were not correlated with cimt in ischemic stroke patients. both folate and vitb12 were decreased in hyperhomocysteinemic ischemic stroke patients. objective hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with atherosclerotic risk. although vitamins can lower homocysteine (hcy), information about effects on atherosclerosis is scarce.   methods we used carotid intima-media thickness (imt) as an accepted marker of atherosclerotic changes. fifty patients (60 +/- 8 years) with imt> or =1 mm were included. in a double blind, randomized trial they received daily 2.5 mg folic acid, 25 mg vitamin b6, and 0.5mg vitamin b12 or placebo for 1 year.   results in the treatment group, hcy decreased from 10.50 +/- 3.93 to 6.56 +/- 1.53 micromol/l (p < 0.0001), whereas it remained unchanged in the placebo group (10.76 +/- 2.36 versus 10.45+/-3.30 micromol/l). imt decreased from 1.50 +/- 0.44 to 1.42 +/- 0.48 mm (p = 0.034) in the treatment group, whereas it increased from 1.47 +/- 0.57 to 1.54 +/- 0.71 mm in the placebo group. the mean individual changes of imt between both groups differed significantly (-0.08 +/- 0.17 versus 0.07 +/- 0.25 mm, p = 0.019). multiple regression analysis revealed that the observed effect on imt depended only on medication.   conclusions vitamin supplementation significantly reduces imt in patients at risk. this effect is independent of hcy concentration.
during a narrative discourse, accessibility of the referents is rarely fixed once and for all. rather, each referent varies in accessibility as the discourse unfolds, depending on the presence and prominence of the other referents. this leads the speaker to use various referential expressions to refer to the main protagonists of the story at different moments in the narrative. this study relies on a new, collaborative storytelling in sequence task designed to assess how speakers adjust their referential choices when they refer to different characters at specific discourse stages corresponding to the introduction, maintaining, or shift of the character in focus, in increasingly complex referential contexts. referential complexity of the stories was manipulated through variations in the number of characters (1 vs. 2) and, for stories in which there were two characters, in their ambiguity in gender (different vs. same gender). data were coded for the type of reference markers as well as the type of reference content (i.e., the extent of the information provided in the referential expression). results showed that, beyond the expected effects of discourse stages on reference markers (more indefinite markers at the introduction stage, more pronouns at the maintaining stage, and more definite markers at the shift stage), the number of characters and their ambiguity in gender also modulated speakers' referential choices at specific discourse stages, for the maintaining stage, an effect of the number of characters was observed for the use of pronouns and of definite markers, with more pronouns when there was a single character, sometimes replaced by definite expressions when two characters were present in the story. for the shift stage, an effect of gender ambiguity was specifically noted for the reference content with more specific information provided in the referential expression when there was referential ambiguity. reference content is an aspect of referential marking that is rarely addressed in a narrative context, yet it revealed a quite flexible referential behavior by the speakers. in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
study question what is the prevalence, phenotype and metabolic features of polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) in the same population according to three different diagnostic criteria?   summary answer the prevalence of pcos under national institutes of health (nih), rotterdam and androgen excess and pcos (ae-pcos) society criteria was 6.1, 19.9 and 15.3%, respectively. pcos carried a 2-fold increased risk of metabolic syndrome regardless of the diagnostic criteria used.   what is known and what this paper adds the prevalence rates of pcos differ depending on the diagnostic criteria used to define the syndrome. the current paper gives the prevalence rates of the component and composite phenotypes of pcos in the same population and reports similar rates of metabolic syndrome in women with pcos under contrasting diagnostic criteria.   design in this cross-sectional study, 392 women between the ages of 18 and 45 years were analyzed.   participants and setting when the prevalence of pcos according to nih was set to 8% with a precision of 2.2% and confidence interval of 95%, the sample size required for a prevalence survey was found to be 400 subjects. the study was carried out in the general directorate of mineral research and exploration, a government-based institute, in which the largest number of female staff (n = 527) are employed within a single institute in ankara, turkey. the study was performed between 7 december 2009 and 30 april 2010. all female subjects between the ages of 18 and 45 years were invited to participate. women older than 45 or younger than 18 years, post-menopausal women, women with a history of hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy and pregnant women were excluded. totally, 392 of the employees were recruited for the final analyses.   main results and the role of chance the prevalence of pcos under nih, rotterdam and ae-pcos society criteria were 6.1, 19.9 and 15.3%, respectively. while the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 6.1% in the whole study group, within the patients diagnosed as pcos according to nih, rotterdam and ae-pcos society criteria, it was 12.5, 10.3 and 10.0%, respectively.   bias, confounding and other reasons for caution even though we have included women working at a single institution with a high response rate for the participation, we cannot exclude potential selection bias due to undetermined differences between our sample and background community. we might have underestimated actual prevalence of metabolic syndrome in pcos due to lack of oral glucose tolerance test 2 h glucose data.   generalizability to other populations current results can be generalized to caucasian populations and may present variations in other populations according to race and ethnicity.   study funding/competing interest(s) this work was, in part, sponsored by merck serono.   trial registration number not applicable. to determine the prevalence of polycystic ovaries as identified by ultrasound in a group of young, postmenarcheal women in the normal population, and to investigate how polycystic ovaries are related to the spectrum of clinical and biochemical symptoms associated with the polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos).
summarybackground breast cancer is highly prevalent among women worldwide. it is classified into three main subtypes: estrogen receptor positive (er+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (her2+), and triple negative breast cancer (tnbc). this study has evaluated the effects of aspirin and metformin, isolated or in a combination, in breast cancer cells of the different subtypes. methods the breast cancer cell lines mcf-7, mda-mb-231, and sk-br-3 were treated with aspirin and/or metformin (0.01 mm - 10 mm); functional in vitro assays were performed. the interactions with the estrogen receptors (er) were evaluated in silico. results metformin (2.5, 5 and 10 mm) altered the morphology and reduced the viability and migration of the er+ cell line mcf-7, whereas aspirin triggered this effect only at 10 mm. a synergistic effect for the combination of metformin and aspirin (2.5, 5 or 10 mm each) was observed in the tnbc cell subtype mda-mb-231, according to the evaluation of its viability and colony formation. partial inhibitory effects were observed for either of the drugs in the her2+ cell subtype sk-br-3. the effects of metformin and aspirin partly relied on cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) upregulation, without the production of lipoxins. in silico, metformin and aspirin bound to the erα receptor with the same energy. conclusion we have provided novel evidence on the mechanisms of action of aspirin and metformin in breast cancer cells, showing favorable outcomes for these drugs in the er+ and tnbc subtypes. breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer and second leading cause of mortality in women. metformin is a widely prescribed anti-hyperglycemic drug, which is emerging as a potential cancer preventative and treatment agent. however, the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of metformin on cancer cell growth and the induction of cancer cell apoptosis are not fully elucidated. the present study aimed to identify the pathways regulated by metformin in two breast cancer cell lines, mda-mb-231 and mda-mb-435. cells were treated with various concentrations of metformin and then evaluated with respect to viability, proliferation, adenosine triphosphate (atp) and reactive oxygen species (ros) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm), and the expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins. metformin caused apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and decreased cell viability and atp production. furthermore, metformin induced the generation of ros and decreased the ∆ψm. moreover, metformin downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins b-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia-1, and upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic bcl-2-associated x protein in mda-mb-231 cells. these results demonstrate that the apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of metformin on breast cancer cells are mediated by the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway.
to investigate the burden of ankylosing spondylitis in the czech republic as a baseline for future health economic evaluations. data were obtained from two cross-sectional studies beda i (2005) and beda ii (2008), performed in 1,008 and 509 patients, respectively. methodology used was cost-of-illness prevalence-based analysis bottom-up approach. analysis was performed from payer (health insurance companies) and societal perspective (including productivity costs using friction cost approach). mean age of sample in beda i and beda ii was 50.2 and 52.5 years, male were present by 61.0 and 62.7 %; average disease duration was 23.0 and 26.4 years, respectively. mean total annual costs per patient in the sample were €4,782 in beda i and €5806 in beda ii. average direct costs per patient in the sample per year are estimated at €1,812 (beda i) and €2,588 (beda ii) with the average productivity costs €2,970 (beda i) and €3,218 (beda ii). we observed a small decrement in percentage (6.7 %) of productivity costs for beda ii as an influence of higher consumption of biologic drugs, hence higher direct costs and possible productivity preservation. the largest direct cost burdens were spa procedures (45.3 %, beda i) and biological drugs (52.8 %, beda ii). unique analysis of the burden of the as in the central-eastern europe presents health care resource and cost consumption by comparing two cross-sectional prevalence-based studies. further analysis should be carried to obtain data connecting health status with costs consumption in order to analyse the as from this perspective. objectives in trial-based analyses, the human capital (hc) approach is currently applied alternately with and without the incorporation of productivity costs for persons who are work disabled at baseline of the trial. we call these methods hc-extended (hc(ext)) and hc-limited (hc(lim)), respectively. aim of the paper is to compare productivity costs according to hc(ext) with hc(lim) and the friction cost (fc) method, in patients with borderline personality disorder (bpd).   methods data were obtained from a multicenter randomized trial in the netherlands, comparing two types of outpatient psychotherapy, schema focused therapy (sft, n = 44) versus transference focused psychotherapy (tfp, n = 42) for bpd. mean age was 31.7 for sft and 29.5 for tfp. a cost-interview was administered every three months for three years, and once again after the fourth year. productivity costs were calculated according to hc(lim), hc(ext) and fc. a nonparametric bootstrap resampling method was performed.   results during the trial, the number of work-disabled patients increased for both treatments. total productivity costs for hc(ext) were higher than for hc(lim) and fc. in addition, the incremental bootstrapped costs (tfp - sft) pointed in the same direction for hc(lim) (1168 euro; 95% ui 4700 euro, 7563 euro) and fc (1206 euro; -2835 euro, 4844 euro), but turned around for hc(ext)(minus 1240 euro; -9973 euro, 7911 euro). none of the increments were statistically significantly different from zero.   conclusions the classical and frequently discussed contrast between hc and fc is not the only difference when it concerns productivity costs. whether or not including productivity costs for patients who are work-disabled at baseline can lead to contradictory conclusions.
summaryp73, the first homologue of the tumour suppressor protein p53, was recently discovered on chromosome 1p36 and has been shown to induce apoptosis in a p53-like manner. the present study was performed with the aim of investigating the expression of p53, its new homologue p73 and the occurrence of apoptosis in cholangiocellular carcinoma. protein levels of p73 were examined in 41 patients with curatively (r0-) resected cholangiocellular carcinomas with an antiserum, raised against a peptide in the n-terminal domain of p73. the incidence of mutations in the p53 gene was analysed by direct sequencing and also immunohistochemically. apoptotic cell death was assessed using in-situ end-labelling (isel) technique in combination with morphological criteria. the results obtained were correlated with patient survival. immunostaining of p73 protein was detected in 17/41 carcinomas examined (41%). the immunoreactivity was confined to the cell nucleus. in 15/41 patients (37%), mutations of the p53 gene were observed. eleven out of these 15 patients stained also positive for p73. in contrast, out of 26 patients without any detectable p53 mutation, only six exhibited p73 immunostaining. we failed to observe a correlation between p73 expression or p53 and apoptosis within a given tumour. survival analysis including the parameters stage and grade of disease, p73 and p53, and also apoptosis, showed that tumour stage and grade as well as p53 and p73 were significantly related to prognosis. in cox regression survival analysis, however, only extent of primary tumour and lymph node status had an independent prognostic impact. our results with a high prevalence of p73 within tumours harbouring mutated p53 gene suggest that p73 could compensate for p53 function. we failed to establish p73 or p53 as independent prognostic factors in cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver. background & aims we previously reported that intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (iccs) can be divided into three categories according to their gross appearance with possible links to biological behavior. ki-ras and p53 gene alterations are thought to be involved in early and late phases of carcinogenesis, respectively. this study was performed to investigate the relationship between the gross appearance and genetic alterations of icc.   methods we examined 21 patients with icc. ki-ras point mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism methods followed by direct dna sequencing. expressions of p53 protein were immunohistochemically assessed.   results ki-ras point mutations were found in 10 patients (48%), and expressions of p53 protein were detected in 4 (19%). applying the gross classification that we previously proposed, ki-ras mutations were prominent in the periductal extension type (4 of 6; 67%) and the spicula-forming type (6 of 10; 60%). on the other hand, none of the five mass-forming-type tumors harbored ki-ras mutations. expressions of p53 protein did not show any clear association with gross appearance.   conclusions ki-ras gene alterations may be involved in the cholangiocarcinogenesis of periductal extension and spicula-forming but not mass-forming types, suggesting that the underlying processes of development are different.
this study assessed spatial memory and orientation strategies in chiloscyllium griseum. in the presence of visual landmarks, six sharks were trained in a fixed turn response. group 1 started from two possible compartments approaching two goal locations, while group 2 started from and approached only one location, respectively. the learning criterion was reached within 9 ± 5.29 (group 1) and 8.3 ± 3.51 sessions (group 2). transfer tests revealed that sharks had applied a direction strategy, possibly in combination with some form of place learning. without visual cues, sharks relied solely on the former. to identify the underlying neural substrate(s), telencephalic were lesioned and performance compared before and after surgery. ablation of the dorsal and medial pallia only had an effect on one shark (group 1), indicating that the acquisition and retention of previously gained knowledge were unaffected in the remaining four individuals. nonetheless, the shark re-learned the task. in summary, c. griseum can utilize fixed turn responses to navigate to a goal; there is also some evidence for the use of external visual landmarks while orienting. probably, strategies can be used alone or in combination. neither the dorsal nor medial pallium seems to be responsible for the acquisition and processing of egocentric information. the present work analyzes the involvement of telencephalon of goldfish in spatial strategies, using a procedure analogue to the hole-board task. with this aim, goldfish with sham operation or telencephalon ablation were trained to find a baited feeder within a twenty-five feeder matrix, which maintained stable spatial relationships relative to five peripheral landmarks. after training, different types of probe tests were conducted. although both groups learned the task, probe trials showed that whereas the sham animals used the whole configuration of cues to implement map-like strategies the telencephalic animals used a guidance strategy based on cues located in the vicinity of the baited feeder. these results confirm the role of teleost fish telencephalon in the use of allocentric strategies obtained with other spatial procedures, and indicate that the hole-board task described here for goldfish is a useful tool to assess the neural bases of spatial cognition in teleost fish.
sulfur mustard (sm) is a chemical warfare agent (cwa) that was first used in world war i and in several military conflicts afterwards. the threat by sm is still present even today due to remaining stockpiles, old and abandoned remainders all over the world as well as to its ease of synthesis. cwa are banned by the chemical weapons convention (cwc) interdicting their development, production, transport, stockpiling and use and are subjected to controlled destruction. the present case report describes an accidental exposure of three workers that occurred during the destruction of sm. all exposed workers presented a characteristic sm-related clinical picture that started about 4h after exposure with erythema and feeling of tension of the skin at the upper part of the body. later on, superficial blister and a burning phenomenon of the affected skin areas developed. similar symptoms occurred in all three patients differing severity. one patient presented sustained skin affections at the gluteal region while another patient came up with affections of the axilla and genital region. fortunately, full recovery was observed on day 56 after exposure except some little pigmentation changes that were evident even on day 154 in two of the patients. sm-exposure was verified for all three patients using bioanalytical gc ms and lc ms/ms based methods applied to urine and plasma. urinary biotransformation products of the β-lyase pathway were detected until 5 days after poisoning whereas albumin-sm adducts could be found until day 29 underlining the beneficial role of adduct detection for post-exposure verification. in addition, we provide general recommendations for management and therapy in case of sm poisoning. the persistence in rats of sulfur mustard adducts to albumin and hemoglobin was studied in vivo after exposure (intravenously; 0.3 mg/kg; approximately 0.1 ld(50)) of rats to sulfur mustard. the albumin adduct (s-hete)cys-pro-tyr was detectable up to 7 days after the exposure, while the adduct to the n-terminal valine in hemoglobin was still detected after 28 days. the decrease in adduct levels corresponded well with the half-life time of albumin in rats and with the lifetime of the rat erythrocyte. remarkably, the n-terminal valine adduct to hemoglobin increased during the first three days, which implies that there is still free sulfur mustard present during that time. in contrast, the corresponding albumin adduct levels did not increase during this time period. the free sulfur mustard might have accumulated in the erythrocyte cell membrane.
background although early development of testes appears normal in boys with klinefelter syndrome (ks), spermatogonial stem cell (ssc) depletion occurs in mid puberty, leading to infertility. cryopreservation of sscs prior to stem cell loss is an option that is currently offered to boys who have to undergo gonadotoxic treatments. this study aimed to explore the possibility of preserving sscs in pubertal ks adolescents by testicular tissue banking.   methods a retrospective study was conducted in seven non-mosaic 47,xxy adolescents, aged 13-16 years, who were invited for an experimental testicular tissue banking programme during their follow-up at the paediatric endocrinology department of the uz brussel between 2009 and 2011. paraffin-embedded testicular tissue was sectioned and stained with haematoxylin-eosin, and immunostainings were performed for mage-a4, anti-mullerian hormone, inhibin α and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. the presence of spermatogenesis and/or spermatogonia was evaluated.   results massive fibrosis and hyalinization was observed in all but one ks patients. although spermatogonia were seen in five patients, spermatogonia were only present in tubules showing normal architecture in the youngest patient who also had normal follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin b concentrations.   conclusions testicular tissue cryopreservation in ks adolescents should be recommended as soon as possible, probably before hormonal changes of failing sertoli cell function are detected. context the pathogenesis and mechanisms behind the degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in testes of subjects with klinefelter syndrome (ks) are yet unknown.   objective the objective of this prospective clinical study was to characterize the testicular degeneration process during puberty in boys with ks by describing the immunoexpression of some developmentally regulated markers of testis maturation in relation to serum levels of reproductive hormones.   setting this study was conducted at a university central hospital pediatric referral endocrinology outpatient clinic.   patients patients consisted of 14 boys with ks aged 10.1 to 14.0 yr.   main outcome measures main outcome measures were immunoexpression of germ cell differentiation markers (ap-2gamma, chk2, oct-3/4, ny-eso-1, mage-a4) and androgen action-related proteins [androgen receptor (ar), anti-müllerian hormone (amh), mic2, inhibin b; alpha- and betab-subunits] in testicular biopsies of boys with ks in relation to serum reproductive hormone levels.   results in boys with ks, gonocytes differentiated to the spermatogonium stage, but no spermatocytes were visible. despite this, down-regulation of amh expression in the sertoli cells occurred concomitantly with decreasing serum amh levels. expression of inhibin alpha- and betab-subunits appeared in the biopsies even when circulating inhibin b levels were undetectable. in the boys with ks compared with age-matched controls, the proportion of sertoli cell nuclei expressing ar was smaller and cytoplasmic staining of sertoli cells was constantly present.   conclusions we showed with several testis-specific markers in ks that gonocytes differentiate to spermatogonia and that the degeneration of the testes accelerates at the onset of puberty. altered immunoexpression of ar indicates that a relative androgen deficiency, at least at the testicular level, develops in boys with ks during puberty.
purpose: to investigate the presence of hearing impairment, represented by a decreased audiometric threshold and/ or absence of otoacoustic emissions, associated with general characteristics, chronic complications and comorbidities in patients with type 2 diabetes. methods: the study was carried out a secondary care unit in fortaleza, from april to july 2010, using a sample of 152 patients aged 36 to 60 with type 2 diabetes. the clinical data related to diabetes was analyzed and an audiological evaluation consisting of pure tone audiometry, otoacoustic emissions elicited by transient stimuli and distortion. results: the female gender predominated, with 95 (62.5%) patients. the mean age was 53.4 years. sensorineural hearing loss was found in 96 (63.2%) patients, mainly cochlear loss (83.3%). 114 patients (75%) had an absence of transient emissions, and 120 (78.9%), had an absence of distortion product emissions. diabetic men had a 4.4 times greater chance of hearing loss than women. the longer the disease time the greater the chance of hearing loss. diabetic patients over 50 years old were also more likely to have hearing loss. conclusion: of the comorbidities and complications associated with diabetes, overweight/obesity was a risk factor for auditory alterations and is associated with hearing loss and the absence of transient emissions. overweight/obese diabetic patients were 3 times more likely to have impaired audiometry and otoacoustic emissions. hearing threshold of 40 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and 20 healthy controls were determined using pure tone audiometry of frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 hz and evoked otoacoustic emissions (eoaes). the hypoacusis was bilateral, progressive and neurosensory nature, affecting the higher frequencies. subjects with diabetes type 2 were more likely to have a hearing loss than were subjects without diabetes (95% vs 65%). this difference was statistically significant. hearing loss was significantly correlated with age and duration of diabetes. evoked otoacoustic emissions found out only in 2 patients with normal hearing. the results suggest that eoaes doesn't show subclinical cochlear damage in diabetic patients because of the significant hearing loss.
in the last decade, an extensive effort has been made to characterize the human microbiota, due to its clinical and economic interests. however, a metagenomic approach to the skin microbiota is hampered by the high proportion of host dna that is recovered. in contrast with the burgeoning field of gut metagenomics, skin metagenomics has been hindered by the absence of an efficient method to avoid sequencing the host dna. we present here a method for recovering microbial dna from skin samples, based on a combination of molecular techniques. we have applied this method to mouse skin, and have validated it by standard, quantitative pcr and amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna. the taxonomic diversity recovered was not altered by this new method, as proved by comparing the phylogenetic structure revealed by 16s rrna sequencing in untreated vs. treated samples. as proof of concept, we also present the first two mouse skin metagenomes, which allowed discovering new taxa (not only prokaryotes but also viruses and eukaryots) not reachable by 16s rrna sequencing, as well as to characterize the skin microbiome functional landscape. our method paves the way for the development of skin metagenomics, which will allow a much deeper knowledge of the skin microbiome and its relationship with the host, both in a healthy state and in relation to disease. host-commensal relationships in the skin are a complex system governed by variables related to the host, the bacteria and the environment. a disruption of this system may lead to new steady states, which, in turn, may lead to disease. we have studied one such disruption by characterizing the skin microbiota in healthy and immunodepressed (id) mice. a detailed anatomopathological study failed to reveal any difference between the skin of healthy and id mice. we sequenced the 16s rdna v1-v2 gene region to saturation in 10 healthy and 10 id 8 week-old mice, and found than all of the healthy and two of the id mice had bacterial communities that were similar in composition to that of human skin, although, presumably because of the uniform raising conditions, less interindividual variation was found in mice. however, eight id mice showed microbiota dominated by staphylococcus epidermidis. quantitative pcr amplification of 16s rdna gene and of the staphylococcus-specific tstag region confirmed the previous results and indicated that the quantitative levels of staphylococcus were similar in both groups while the total number of 16s copies was greater in the healthy mice. thus, it is possible that, under long-term immunodeficiency, which removes the acquired but not the native immune system, s.epidermidis may inhibit the growth of other bacteria but does not cause a pathogenic state.
summary. we propose a new search algorithm for a special type of subspace clusters, called maximal 1-complete regions, from high dimensional binary valued datasets. our algorithm is suitable for dense datasets, where the number of maximal 1-complete regions is much larger than the number of objects in the datasets. unlike other algorithms that find clusters only in relatively dense subspaces, our algorithm finds clusters in all subspaces. we introduce the concept of weighted density in order to find interesting clusters in relatively sparse subspaces. experimental results show that our algorithm is very efficient, and uses much less memory than other algorithms. mining frequent closed itemsets provides complete and non-redundant results for frequent pattern analysis. extensive studies have proposed various strategies for efficient frequent closed itemset mining, such as depth-first search vs. breadthfirst search, vertical formats vs. horizontal formats, tree-structure vs. other data structures, top-down vs. bottom-up traversal, pseudo projection vs. physical projection of conditional database, etc. it is the right time to ask "what are the pros and cons of the strategies?" and "what and how can we pick and integrate the best strategies to achieve higher performance in general cases?"in this study, we answer the above questions by a systematic study of the search strategies and develop a winning algorithm closet+. closet+ integrates the advantages of the previously proposed effective strategies as well as some ones newly developed here. a thorough performance study on synthetic and real data sets has shown the advantages of the strategies and the improvement of closet+ over existing mining algorithms, including closet, charm and op, in terms of runtime, memory usage and scalability.
backgroundit is not known whether following transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas the vision of patients with preoperative chiasma syndromes (cs) does improve to the degree of vision of patients without preoperative cs.objectivethe purpose of this study is to answer the question above.methodspertinent data of a successive series of patients operated transsphenoidally for the first time for pituitary adenoma were retrospectively analysed.resultsof the 304 patients, 35.1% presented preoperatively with cs. the median visual acuity (va) of these patients improved significantly from preoperative (right eye, 0.63 (0; 1.25); left eye, 0.56 (0; 1.4)) to postoperative (right eye, 0.8 (0; 1.25); left eye, 0.74 (0; 1.25)). the median number of impaired quadrants of the binocular visual fields (vf) improved significantly from preoperative (2 (0; 8)) to postoperative cs (0 (0; 4)). in patients without preoperative cs, postoperative vision (va as well as vf) remained unchanged. postoperatively, va of patients with preoperative cs remained significantly lower than that of patients without preoperative cs (right eye, 0.96 (0.2; 1.4); left eye, 0.94 (0.05; 1.4)). postoperatively, the number of impaired quadrants of the binocular vf of patients with preoperative cs remained significantly higher than in patients without preoperative cs (0 (0; 1)).conclusionin this unselected patient series, the vision (va as well as vf) of patients with preoperative cs did not improved postoperatively to the degree of the vision of patients without preoperative cs. thus, in patients with adenomatous chiasma compression transsphenoidal surgery may be indicated before cs develops. summarythe lack of a standard quantitative method of assessing the degree of visual deficit hinders comparison of the results of the different methods available for treating visual failure due to a pituitary tumour.this report describes a simple, semi-quantitative, and precise approach, and illustrates its use in 34 patients treated by transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and radiotherapy. visual improvement occurred in 85%, and no patient sustained deterioration of vision. visual loss before operation was scored at a mean of 51.4%, and was reduced to a mean of 27.4% after a minimum of 12 months follow-up. the factor that had the greatest influence on visual recovery was the degree of visual loss at presentation. it is therefore essential to be able to compare this variable before attempting to assess if outcome is different in patients treated by different methods.
conclusion. a so far unattained high rate (100%) of residual hearing preservation in cochlear implantation for electric-acoustic stimulation could be achieved using sophisticated surgical techniques in combination with the medel flex eas electrode. objectives. this study aimed to gather first audiological and surgical results from the experience gained with the new medel flex eas electrode array. patients and methods. nine patients (aged 7.62–71.32 years) with profound high frequency hearing loss were supplied with this atraumatic electrode, which was designed to preserve residual hearing despite intracochlear insertion of an electrode array. all patients were implanted by the same surgeon. results. hearing preservation was achieved in all patients (complete preservation 44.44%) after a mean follow-up period of 9.73 months. mean monosyllabic test scores improved from 9% correct with the hearing aid alone to 48% with the cochlear implant and to 65% in the electric-acoustic mode. objective:to report on combined ipsilateral electrical and acoustic stimulation in a subset of conventional candidates for cochlear implantation where preoperative pure tone thresholds were ≤60 db hl for 250 and 500 hz. methods: subjects were 10 adults implanted with the nucleus 24 contour advance perimodiolar electrode array. soft surgical procedures were strictly observed: ≤1.5-mm cochleostomy hole placed anterior and inferior to the round window, a healon bubble placed over the opening to prevent entry of foreign bodies, and no suction applied. the electrode array was inserted 17 mm to the first marker rib using the recommended ‘advance-off-stylet’ technique. pure tone hearing threshold levels were recorded pre-, and postoperatively at 1–2 and 6–12 months. speech recognition was tested for cochlear implant (ci) alone and combined with ipsilateral hearing aid for 7 subjects who retained significant residual hearing in the implanted ear at 1–2 months after operation. results: there were 3/10 cases where 1–2 months after operation low-frequency responses were considered vibrotactile only (>85–110 db hl, 250–500 hz). in the remaining 7 cases, residual hearing was maintained up to at least 6 months after operation with minor changes. insertion depth angles in these cases ranged from 285 to 420°. for these subjects, the mean preoperative score for words presented at 65 db spl was 22%. mean postoperative scores were 56% for ci alone, and 68% for ci plus ipsilateral hearing aid (p < 0.05, paired t). for sentences presented in multitalker babble noise at 5 db snr, mean scores were 61% ci alone, and 75% ci+ipsiha (p < 0.01, paired t). conclusions: hearing was conserved during surgery and over time in 70% of conventional candidates implanted with the nucleus 24 contour advance ci who had significant levels of preoperative low-frequency residual hearing (≤60 db hl). these conventional candidates for ci also benefited from improved speech recognition in noise when using combined ipsilateral electrical and acoustic stimulation.
idiopathic olfactory loss neural consequences have been studied especially by means of magnetic resonance imaging. since other functional neuroimaging technique findings are lacking in the literature, present study used a validated 18f-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (fdg) functional positron emission tomography procedure under olfactory stimulation (os) to assess brain changes in idiopathic anosmic patients (iaps) in comparison with healthy subjects (hs). a voxel-based analysis between these groups was used to evaluate fdg uptake in the brain and perform a correlation analysis between metabolic responses and the sniffin’ stick test as well as intensity visuo-analogue scores and disease duration (dd). a significant relative decrease of glucose metabolism in the right and left frontal lobes, left insula, right parietal lobe, and left occipital, temporal and parietal lobes was found in iaps during os. the same condition resulted in a relative higher glucose metabolism in the right cerebellum in iaps. moreover, a negative correlation between dd and fdg uptake in the left temporo-parietal joint was found in iaps. such a correlation suggested a possible involvement of this area metabolic decrease in self-consciousness impairment, which is known to affect iaps. present preliminary functional results could be of interest to further deepen such neural impairments possibly useful for future perspective in pharmaceutical and rehabilitative protocols. although multivariate analytic techniques might identify diagnostic patterns that are not captured by univariate methods, they have rarely been used to study the neural correlates of alzheimer's disease (ad) or cognitive impairment. nonquantitative h2(15)o pet scans were acquired during rest in 17 probable ad subjects selected for mild severity [mean-modified mini mental status examination (mmms) 46/57; sd 5.1], 16 control subjects (mmms 54; sd 2.5) and 23 subjects with minimal to mild cognitive impairment but no dementia (mmms 53; sd 2.8). expert clinical reading had low success in discriminating ad and controls. there were no significant mean flow differences among groups in traditional univariate spm noxel-wise analyses or region of interest (roi) analyses. a covariance pattern was identified whose mean expression was significantly higher in the ad as compared to controls (p = 0.03; sensitivity 76-94%; specificity 63-81%). sites of increased concomitant flow included insula, cuneus, pulvinar, lingual, fusiform, superior occipital and parahippocampal gyri, whereas decreased concomitant flow was found in cingulate, inferior parietal lobule, middle and inferior frontal, supramarginal and precentral gyri. the covariance analysis-derived pattern was then prospectively applied to the cognitively impaired subjects: as compared to subjects with clinical dementia rating (cdr) = 0, subjects with cdr = 0.5 had significantly higher mean covariance pattern expression (p = 0.009). expression of this pattern correlated inversely with selective reminding test total recall (r = -0.401, p = 0.002), delayed recall (r = -0.351, p = 0.008) and mmms scores (r = -0.401, p = 0.002) in all three groups combined. we conclude that patients with ad may differentially express resting cerebral blood flow covariance patterns even at very early disease stages. significant alterations in expression of resting flow covariance patterns occur even for subjects with cognitive impairment. expression of covariance patterns correlates with cognitive and functional performance measures, holding promise for meaningful associations with underlying biopathological processes.
thrombophilia and impaired placental vasculature are a major cause of adverse pregnancy outcome. in 2007, a new hereditary factor for obstetric complications and recurrent pregnancy loss (rpl) was identified as a sequence variation in the core promoter of the annexin a5 gene, anxa5, called the m2 haplotype. m2 carriership has been demonstrated in couples with recurrent miscarriage and its origin is embryonic rather than specifically maternal, confirmed by subsequent papers. the m2 haplotype is the first report of a hereditary factor related to pregnancy pathology caused by embryonic-induced anticoagulation. it has been demonstrated that couples with rpl had equal and significantly increased m2 carriership and that maternal and paternal carriership confers equal risk. given its importance for patients with rpl, and potentially implantation failure, this study assessed the incidence of carrier status for the m2 anxa5 haplotype in both the male and female of couples attending five care ivf centres. in 314 patients (157 couples), 44% of couples (one or both partners), 24% of females, 26% of males and 37% of couples with unexplained infertility were m2 carriers. this high incidence has provoked further urgent studies on specific patient populations and on the value of post embryo-transfer therapy. objective to study the possible contribution of paternal, in addition to maternal, carriage of m2/anxa5 as a risk factor for recurrent pregnancy loss (rpl).   design case-control study.   setting academic research center.   patient(s) couples presenting themselves to the fertility center, ludwig-maximilians-university munich with two or more consecutive, unexplained miscarriages were selected for this study. fertile female controls were from the same center and also from the resource of the institute of human genetics, westfalian wilhelms-university muenster. population controls were drafted from the popgen biobank, university clinic schleswig-holstein kiel.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) incidence of m2 carriage was estimated in patient and control groups, odds ratios were calculated, and rpl risk was evaluated.   result(s) in comparison with female fertile controls, the risk for repeated abortion in the rpl group, associated with m2 carriage, was between 1.7 and 3.8, and it was 2.3 compared with population controls. because of the equal genetic incidence of m2, with an allelic frequency of 0.167 in the female and male partner rpl subgroups, the haplotype confers approximately the same relative risk to carriers of both sexes.   conclusion(s) paternal m2 carriage seems to confer an equal risk for recurrent miscarriages as m2 carriage in rpl mothers. this finding points to a role of anxa5 and the m2 haplotype in the fetus and/or the extraembryonic membranes for pregnancy pathology. prognostic rpl algorithms might be improved by testing the male partner for m2 carriage, and this may guide adequate therapeutic decisions.
the purpose of this study was to estimate and analyze the causes of male infertility in fertility and ivf center in maternity teaching hospital in hawler city-iraq, and to determine the effect of paternal age and smoking habits on basic semen parameters (count x10/ml, motility, and normal morphology). this study was carried out retrospectively over two years period extended from jan. 2011 to dec. 2012 on 1055 infertile couples attended fertility and ivf center of maternity teaching hospital in hawler city capital of kurdistan-iraq, among them 368(34.8%) were male factor infertility among 368 men, 142 (13.45%) were azoospermic, 687 (65.2%) were female factor infertility with unknown causes. the largest male diagnostic category was men with unknown cause (43%). beyond this, varicocele (17.2%), then male accessory gland infection (12.9%) after that obstructive (12.6%). however, ejaculatory dysfunction, congenital abnormality, chromosomal abnormality, and male descended testes were very infrequent. men were divided into two groups according to smoking habit, 198 of them were smoker and 230 of them were nonsmoker. the obtained mean of semen parameters were lower in nonsmoker than smoker and this difference was not significant statistically. 1036 men were separated into seven groups according to their ages. the result showed that the mean and sd of all three semen parameters for men age ≥50 lower than other age groups and this difference was statistically significant for total motility by lsd test with p= 0.012, and for normal morphology 0.014. so in conclusion the influence of paternal age on semen parameters was significant. the study examined the epidemiology and causes of infertility in tomsk, western siberia, using methodological approaches recommended by who and was based on the findings for a randomly selected sample of 2000 married women aged 18-45 years. among the respondents, 333 couples were considered infertile since they had not conceived after 12 months or more of unprotected intercourse. this group of infertile couples was offered comprehensive clinical investigations but only 186 couples completed them. the infertility rate in tomsk was 16.7%, being caused by diseases of the female reproduction system in 52.7% of the couples and by male reproductive diseases in 6.4%. in 38.7% of couples, both spouses suffered from infertility, while in 2.2% of cases the cause of infertility was not determined. among the causes of female infertility, secondary infertility dominated (12.9% of all the women questioned), while primary infertility affected 3.8% of the women. the most frequent causes of female infertility were disturbances to tubal patency (36.5%) and pelvic adhesions (23.6%). endocrine pathology was found in 32.8% of cases. the most frequent cause of male infertility was inflammatory disease of male accessory glands (12.9%). in 8.6% of cases infection resulted in obstructive azoospermia. varicocele was registered in 11.3% of cases, and idiopathic pathospermia in 20.9%. inflammatory complications among females were 4.2 times more frequent than among males.
background aerobic organisms are susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species. oxidative stress resistance is a quantitative trait with population variation attributable to the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. drosophila melanogaster provides an ideal system to study the genetics of variation for resistance to oxidative stress. methods and findings we used 167 wild-derived inbred lines of the drosophila genetic reference panel for a genome-wide association study of acute oxidative stress resistance to two oxidizing agents, paraquat and menadione sodium bisulfite. we found significant genetic variation for both stressors. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with variation in oxidative stress resistance were often sex-specific and agent-dependent, with a small subset common for both sexes or treatments. associated snps had moderately large effects, with an inverse relationship between effect size and allele frequency. linear models with up to 12 snps explained 67–79% and 56–66% of the phenotypic variance for resistance to paraquat and menadione sodium bisulfite, respectively. many genes implicated were novel with no known role in oxidative stress resistance. bioinformatics analyses revealed a cellular network comprising dna metabolism and neuronal development, consistent with targets of oxidative stress-inducing agents. we confirmed associations of seven candidate genes associated with natural variation in oxidative stress resistance through mutational analysis. conclusions we identified novel candidate genes associated with variation in resistance to oxidative stress that have context-dependent effects. these results form the basis for future translational studies to identify oxidative stress susceptibility/resistance genes that are evolutionary conserved and might play a role in human disease. backgroundduring their life, multicellular organisms are challenged with oxidative stress. it is generated by several reactive oxygen species (ros), may limit lifespan and has been related to several human diseases. ros can generate a wide variety of defects in many cellular components and thus the response of the organism challenged with oxidative stress may share some features with other stress responses. conversely, in spite of recent progress, a complete functional analysis of the transcriptional responses to different oxidative stresses in model organisms is still missing. in addition, the functional significance of observed transcriptional changes is still elusive.resultswe used oligonucleotide microarrays to address the specificities of transcriptional responses of adult drosophila to different stresses induced by paraquat and h2o2, two oxidative stressors, and by tunicamycin which induces an endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress. both specific and common responses to the three stressors were observed and whole genome functional analysis identified several important classes of stress responsive genes. within some functional classes, we observed that isozymes do not all behave similarly, which may reflect unsuspected functional specificities. moreover, genetic experiments performed on a subset of lines bearing mutations in genes identified in microarray experiments showed that a significant number of these mutations may affect resistance of adult drosophila to oxidative stress.conclusionsa long term common stress response to paraquat- or h2o2-induced oxidative stresses and er stress is observed for a significant number of genes. besides this common response, the unexpected complexity of the stress responses to oxidative and er stresses in drosophila, suggest significant specificities in protective properties between genes associated to the same functional classes. according to our functional analysis, a large part of the genome may play a role in protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in drosophila.
benzo(a)pyrene (bap) is a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, also found in nature due to human activities. bap adheres to sediments showing toxic effects on benthic organisms, including midge larvae of the family chironomidae. we tested for toxic effects of benzo(a)pyrene on chironomus sancticaroli strixino & strixino 1981 using biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers, to identify changes in metabolic and antioxidant pathways, besides neurotoxic and dna damage. enzyme activity was compared by exposing larvae to four nominal concentrations (0.47, 2.13, 3.41, and 4.73 μg l−1) and dna damage to two concentrations (0.47 and 4.73 μg l−1), after exposure at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. bap caused neurotoxic effect, showing acetylcholinesterase alterations at different treatments. changes in the biotransformation pathway were detected, with an increased activity of alpha and beta esterase in 48 h and reduction of glutathione-s-transferase activity in all periods at the highest concentrations. damage to the antioxidant system was observed by the increase of the superoxide dismutase and reduction of the catalase, in 48 h. genotoxicity was detected by an increased dna damage at 48 and 72 h. the lowest concentration (0.47 μg l−1), even presenting low mortality, also altered the biochemical parameters of the larvae. thus, these results indicate that bap causes metabolic, neurotoxic, and genotoxic effects on c. sancticaroli, even at low concentrations and short-term exposure. bap can cause damage of immature invertebrates, and the ecological dynamics can be affected, since these organisms have trophic importance in the aquatic environment. the toxicological evaluations of crude oil, xylene, toluene and benzene were carried out against juvenile stages of clarias gariepinus. on the basis of lc50 value, benzene (0.017 ml/l) was found to be the most toxic followed by xylene (0.086 ml/l), toluene (0.398 ml/l) and crude oil (2.219 ml/l) was the least toxic. the results of the lipid peroxidation assay showed that the level of malonaldehyde (mda) in liver and gills of fish exposed to all the test chemicals increased significantly (p < 0.05) when compared to control. measurement of activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat) and glutathione-s-transferase (gst) in liver and gill of fishes exposed to sublethal concentration of the test chemicals over a 28-day period was found to decrease significantly (p < 0.05) when compared to control. the observed reduction in the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes such as sod, cat and gst in conjunction with an increase in mda levels in the gill and liver tissues of test animals exposed to aromatic hydrocarbon compounds were recommended as a good battery of biomarkers for early detection of pollution during biomonitoring programmes.
pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum [pcc (formerly erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora)] pc1 causes soft-rot disease in a wide variety of plant species by secreting multiple pathogenicity-related traits. in this study, regulatory mechanism of air-liquid (al) biofilm formation was studied using a cytr homolog gene deletion mutant (δcytr) of pcc pc1. compared to the wild type (pcc pc1), the δcytr mutant produced fragile and significantly (p < 0.001) lower amounts of al biofilm on salt-optimized broth plus 2% glycerol (sobg), yeast peptone dextrose adenine, and also on king’s b at 27°c after 72 h incubation in static condition. the wild type also produced significantly higher quantities of al biofilm on sobgmg– (magnesium deprived) containing cupper (cu2+), zinc (zn2+), manganese (mn2+), magnesium (mg2+), and calcium (ca2+) compared to the δcytr mutant. moreover, the wild type was produced higher amounts of biofilms compared to the mutant while responding to ph and osmotic stresses. the δflic (encoding flagellin), flhd::tn5 (encoding a master regulator) and δmota (a membrane protein essential for flagellar rotation) mutants produced a lighter and more fragile al biofilm on sobg compared to their wild counterpart. all these mutants resulted in having weak bonds with the cellulose specific dye (calcofluor) producing lower quantities of cellulose compared to the wild type. gene expression analysis using mrna collected from the al biofilms showed that δcytr mutant significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the expressions of multiple genes responsible for cellulose production (bcsa, bcse, and adra), motility (flhd, flia, flic, and mota) and type iii secretion system (hrpx, hrpl, hrpa, and hrpn) compared to the wild type. the cytr homolog was therefore, argued to be able to regulate the al biofilm formation by controlling cellulose production, motility and t3ss in pcc pc1. in addition, all the mutants exhibited poorer attachment to radish sprouts and al biofilm cells of the wild type was resistant than stationary-phase and planktonic cells to acidity and oxidative stress compared to the same cells of the δcytr mutant. the results of this study therefore suggest that cytr homolog is a major determinant of pcc pc1’s virulence, attachment and its survival mechanism. cyclic diguanylate (c‐di‐gmp) is a second messenger implicated in the regulation of various cellular properties in several bacterial species. however, its function in phytopathogenic bacteria is not yet understood. in this study we investigated a panel of ggdef/eal domain proteins which have the potential to regulate c‐di‐gmp levels in the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii 3937. two proteins, ecpb (contains ggdef and eal domains) and ecpc (contains an eal domain) were shown to regulate multiple cellular behaviours and virulence gene expression. deletion of ecpb and/or ecpc enhanced biofilm formation but repressed swimming/swarming motility. in addition, the ecpb and ecpc mutants displayed a significant reduction in pectate lyase production, a virulence factor of this bacterium. gene expression analysis showed that deletion of ecpb and ecpc significantly reduced expression of the type iii secretion system (t3ss) and its virulence effector proteins. expression of the t3ss genes is regulated by hrpl and possibly rpon, two alternative sigma factors. in vitro biochemical assays showed that ecpc has phosphodiesterase activity to hydrolyse c‐di‐gmp into linear pgpg. most of the enterobacterial pathogens encode at least one t3ss, a major virulence factor which functions to subvert host defences. the current study broadens our understanding of the interplay between c‐di‐gmp, rpon and t3ss and the potential role of c‐di‐gmp in t3ss regulation among a wide range of bacterial pathogens.
the objective of this study was to identify biomedical factors (body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, and albumin) associated with hospitalization of older adults. all residents of the town of bambuí, minas gerais state, ages > or = 60 years (n = 1,742) were selected for the study, of whom 1,494 (85.2%) participated. none of the biomedical factors studied was independently associated with occurrence of 1 hospitalization during the previous 12 months. body mass index < 20 kg/m and total cholesterol = 200-263 mg/dl and > or 264 mg/dl were independently associated with > or = 2 hospitalizations. the introduction of biomedical factors did not modify the previously identified associations between hospitalization and indicators constructed from information obtained in a questionnaire survey. the results show that data easily obtained through interviews can be useful both for identifying older adults at risk of hospitalization and thus for assisting in prevention. background the aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the paisley-renfrew midspan cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions.   method a cohort analysis was carried out in paisley and renfrew, two post-industrial towns in west central scotland. this used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. the subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. the main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors).   results the following patterns of hospital utilization were found. only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). in contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. the age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). for non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. analysis of risk factors (using cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (fev1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors.   conclusions despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. the absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low fev1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates.
studies of explicit processing of facial expressions by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) have found a variety of deficits and preserved abilities compared to their typically developing (td) peers. however, little attention has been paid to their implicit processing abilities for emotional facial expressions. the question has also been raised whether preferential attention to the mouth region of a speaker's face by asd individuals has resulted in a relative lipreading expertise. we present data on implicit processing of pseudo-dynamic facial emotions and visual speech in adolescents with autism. we compared 25 asd and 25 td participants on their ability to recreate the sequences of four dynamic emotional facial expressions (happy, sad, disgust, fear) as well as four spoken words (with, bath, thumb, watch) using six still images taken from a video sequence. typical adolescents were significantly better at recreating the dynamic properties of emotional expressions than those of facial speech, while the autism group showed the reverse accuracy pattern. for experiment 2 we obscured the eye region of the stimuli and found no significant difference between the 22 adolescents with asd and 22 td controls. fearful faces achieved the highest accuracy results among the emotions in both groups. this study examined differences in the ability to decode emotion through facial expression, prosody, and verbal content between 14 children with asperger’s syndrome (as) and 16 typically developing peers. the ability to decode emotion was measured by the perception of emotion test (poet), which portrayed the emotions of happy, angry, sad, and neutral among the modalities of static and dynamic facial expression, prosody, verbal content, and all modalities combined. results revealed that children with as had more difficulty identifying emotions through static facial expression, dynamic facial expression, and prosody than typically developing children. results are discussed in relationship to an over-reliance on verbal content as a compensatory strategy in social interactions. treatment implications for individuals with as are also discussed.
physical exercise could play a neuroprotective role in both human and animals. however, the involved signal pathways underlying the neuroprotective effect are still not well established. this study was to investigate the possible signal pathways involved in the neuroprotection of pre-ischemic treadmill training after ischemic stroke. seventy-two sd rats were randomly assigned into three groups (n=24/group): sham surgery group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao) group and mcao with exercise group. following three weeks of treadmill training exercise, ischemic stroke was induced by occluding the middle cerebral artery (mca) in rat for 2 h, followed by reperfusion. twenty-four hours after mcao/reperfusion, 12 rats in each group were evaluated for neurological deficit scores and then sacrificed to measure the infarct volume (n=6) and cerebral edema (n=6). six rats in each group were sacrificed to measure the expression level of glutamate transporter-1 (glt-1), protein kinase c-α (pkc-α), akt, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (pi3k) (n=6). two hundred and eighty minutes (4.67 h) after occlusion, six rats in each group were decapitated to detect the mrna expression level of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mglur5) and n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit type 2b (nr2b) (n=6).the results demonstrated that pre-ischemic treadmill training exercise reduced brain infarct volume, cerebral edema and neurological deficits, also decreased the over expression of pkc-α and increased the expression level of glt-1, akt and pi3k after ischemic stroke (p<0.05). the over-expression of mglur5 and nr2b mrna was also inhibited by pre-ischemic exercise (p<0.05). in summary, exercise preconditioning ameliorated brain damage after ischemic stroke, which might be involved in two signal pathways: pkc-α-glt-1-glutamate and pi3k/akt-glt-1-glutamate. previous studies have implicated phospholipase c (plc)-linked group i metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) in regulating the excitability of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons. we used intracellular recordings from rat hippocampal slices and specific antagonists to examine in more detail the mglur receptor subtypes and signal transduction mechanisms underlying this effect. application of the group i mglur agonist (rs)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (dhpg) suppressed slow- and medium-duration afterhyperpolarizations (s- and mahp) and caused a consequent increase in cell excitability as well as a depolarization of the membrane and an increase in input resistance. interestingly, with the exception of the suppression of the mahp, these effects were persistent, and in the case of the sahp lasting for more than 1 h of drug washout. preincubation with the specific mglur5 antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (mpep), reduced but did not completely prevent the effects of dhpg. however, preincubation with both mpep and the mglur1 antagonist ly367385 completely prevented the dhpg-induced changes. these results demonstrate that the dhpg-induced changes are mediated partly by mglur5 and partly by mglur1. because group i mglurs are linked to plc via g-protein activation, we also investigated pathways downstream of plc activation, using chelerythrine and cyclopiazonic acid to block protein kinase c (pkc) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-(ip(3))-activated ca(2+) stores, respectively. neither inhibitor affected the dhpg-induced suppression of the sahp or the increase in excitability nor did an inhibitor of plc itself, u-73122. taken together, these results argue that in ca1 pyramidal cells in the adult rat, dhpg activates mglurs of both the mglur5 and mglur1 subtypes, causing a long-lasting suppression of the sahp and a consequent persistent increase in excitability via a plc-, pkc-, and ip(3)-independent transduction pathway.
summary. memantine is an uncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist which blocks the nmda receptor with moderate-affinity in a use- and voltage dependent manner. in clinical practice it is used chronically in the treatment of dementia and does not induce psychotomimetic effects as, high affinity, uncompetitive antagonists. thus, it was of interest to determine dopamine (da) and metabolite (dopac – dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and hva – homovanillic acid) concentrations in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) in response to 14 days administration of memantine (20 mg/kg/day). it was previously determined that in rats this treatment induces sensitization to the locomotor effect and tolerance to the learning impairing properties of high doses of memantine. acute administration of memantine (20 mg/kg, ip) did not affect dopamine levels in the pfc. it did however increase da metabolite (dopac and hva) concentrations. administration of memantine (20 mg/kg/day) for 14 days before the acute challenge only slightly changed memantine's effect on pfc neurochemistry even though pharmacokinetic tolerance was observed. when memantine was administered to the sham group, which had been repeatedly treated with hypnorm (including neuroleptic), an increase in pfc dopamine and metabolite content was seen. in accordance with the fact that memantine does not possess psychotomimetic activity at therapeutically relevant doses, these experiments showed that it does not affect the prefrontal cortex dopamine levels. we have examined the effects of schizophrenomimetic drugs including phencyclidine (pcp) and methamphetamine (map) on cortical and striatal dopamine (da) metabolism using an in vivo dialysis technique in the rat. an acute systemic injection of pcp (2.5–10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) dramatically increased concentrations of da, 3,4‐dihydroxy‐phenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in the dialysates from the medial frontal cortex in a dose‐dependent fashion. however, pcp (2.5–10 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a much lower augmentation of extracellular da release, with a significant decrease in dialysate dopac levels in the striatum. moreover, continuous infusion of tetrodotoxin (ttx, 10−5 m) into the prefrontal or striatal region through the microdialysis tube completely blocked the ability of pcp (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to alter the extracellular release of da and its metabolites in the respective areas. in contrast, map (4.8 mg/kg, i.p.) elicited a marked and tetrodotoxin‐resistant increase in da levels with a significant loss of dopac contents in the extracellular space of both the frontal cortex and the striatum. the present results clearly demonstrate the differential effects of pcp on cortical and striatal da transmission, suggesting that pcp may facilitate da release in the medial frontal cortex by increasing impulse flow in the da neurons projecting to the cortical area, whereas pcp‐induced elevation of extracellular da in the striatum may be caused mainly by reuptake inhibition of da liberated by basal activity of the striatal da neurons. the regional variation in pcp‐induced da release would be due to the combination of nmda (n‐methyl‐d‐aspartate) receptor blocking and da reuptake inhibition by the drug. the uniform and ttx‐resistant nature of map‐induced changes in brain da metabolism may result from the direct actions of map at da nerve terminals. © 1996 wiley‐liss, inc.
unlabelled activation of vascular endothelial cells (ecs) by growth factors initiates a cascade of events during angiogenesis in vivo consisting of ec tip cell selection, sprout formation, ec stalk cell proliferation, and ultimately vascular stabilization by support cells. although ec functional assays can recapitulate one or more aspects of angiogenesis in vitro, they are often limited by undefined substrates and lack of dependence on key angiogenic signaling axes. here, we designed and characterized a chemically-defined model of endothelial sprouting behavior in vitro using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (ipsc-ecs). we rapidly encapsulated ipsc-ecs at high density in poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) hydrogel spheres using thiol-ene chemistry and subsequently encapsulated cell-dense hydrogel spheres in a cell-free hydrogel layer. the hydrogel sprouting array supported pro-angiogenic phenotype of ipsc-ecs and supported growth factor-dependent proliferation and sprouting behavior. ipsc-ecs in the sprouting model responded appropriately to several reference pharmacological angiogenesis inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor, nf-κb, matrix metalloproteinase-2/9, protein kinase activity, and β-tubulin, which confirms their functional role in endothelial sprouting. a blinded screen of 38 putative vascular disrupting compounds from the us environmental protection agency's toxcast library identified six compounds that inhibited ipsc-ec sprouting and five compounds that were overtly cytotoxic to ipsc-ecs at a single concentration. the chemically-defined ipsc-ec sprouting model (ism) is thus amenable to enhanced-throughput screening of small molecular libraries for effects on angiogenic sprouting and ipsc-ec toxicity assessment.   statement of significance angiogenesis assays that are commonly used for drug screening and toxicity assessment applications typically utilize natural substrates like matrigel(tm) that are difficult to spatially pattern, costly, ill-defined, and may exhibit lot-to-lot variability. herein, we describe a novel angiogenic sprouting assay using chemically-defined, bioinert poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels functionalized with biomimetic peptides to promote cell attachment and degradation in a reproducible format that may mitigate the need for natural substrates. the quantitative assay of angiogenic sprouting here enables precise control over the initial conditions and can be formulated into arrays for screening. the sprouting assay here was dependent on key angiogenic signaling axes in a screen of angiogenesis inhibitors and a blinded screen of putative vascular disrupting compounds from the us-epa. angiogenesis assays are an important tool for studying both the mechanisms of angiogenesis and the potential development of therapeutic strategies to modulate neovascularisation. in vivo angiogenesis assays are considered to be the most informative of these but are often expensive, time-consuming and require specialist training to perform. in vitro assays tend to be more rapid, less expensive and easier to interpret. in vitro angiogenesis assays operate on the principle that endothelial cells form tubule-like structures when cultured on a supportive matrix. assays involving a matrix derived from murine tumours, matrigel (or a growth factor reduced form of this), are now the most common in vitro tubule formation assays. however, another tubule formation assay has recently been developed in which endothelial cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts. here, we have used quantitative image analysis to compare the morphological features of tubules formed in the matrigel assay and this new ‘co-culture’ assay, with those of capillaries formed in a microvascular bed in vivo. tubules formed in standard and growth factor reduced matrigel assays were short and relatively homogeneous, whereas those formed in the co-culture assay were significantly more heterogeneous, consisting of both short and long interconnecting tubules that more closely resembled capillaries than matrigel tubules. moreover, cells on matrigel, and to a lesser extent growth factor reduced (gfr) matrigel, often clumped into large cell aggregates, a feature rarely seen in the co-culture assay. in addition, we demonstrate that matrigel stimulates tubule formation by various non-endothelial cell types, suggesting that tubule formation by endothelial cells may not represent true differentiation of this cell type. in summary, the morphology of tubules in the co-culture assay appears more representative of capillary formation in vivo, than the endothelial cell changes that occur in either form of matrigel assay.
cyclosporin a (csa) suppresses immune function by blocking the cyclophilin a and calcineurin/nfat signaling pathways. in addition to immunosuppression, csa has also been shown to have a wide range of effects in the cardiovascular system including disruption of heart valve development, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and angiogenesis inhibition. circumstantial evidence has suggested that csa might control notch signaling which is also a potent regulator of cardiovascular function. therefore, the goal of this project was to determine if csa controls notch and to dissect the molecular mechanism(s) by which csa impacts cardiovascular homeostasis. we found that csa blocked jag1, but not dll4 mediated notch1 nicd cleavage in transfected 293t cells and decreased notch signaling in zebrafish embryos. csa suppression of notch was linked to cyclophilin a but not calcineurin/nfat inhibition since n-meval-4-csa but not fk506 decreased notch1 nicd cleavage. to examine the effect of csa on vascular development and function, double transgenic fli1-gfp/gata1-rfp zebrafish embryos were treated with csa and monitored for vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and overall cardiovascular function. vascular patterning was not obviously impacted by csa treatment and contrary to the anti-angiogenic activity ascribed to csa, angiogenic sprouting of isv vessels was normal in csa treated embryos. most strikingly, csa treated embryos exhibited a progressive decline in blood flow that was associated with eventual collapse of vascular luminal structures. vascular collapse in zebrafish embryos was partially rescued by global notch inhibition with dapt suggesting that disruption of normal notch signaling by csa may be linked to vascular collapse. however, multiple signaling pathways likely cause the vascular collapse phenotype since both cyclophilin a and calcineurin/nfat were required for normal vascular function. collectively, these results show that csa is a novel inhibitor of notch signaling and vascular function in zebrafish embryos. the notch and calcineurin/nfat pathways have both been implicated in control of keratinocyte differentiation. induction of the p21(waf1/cip1) gene by notch 1 activation in differentiating keratinocytes is associated with direct targeting of the rbp-jkappa protein to the p21 promoter. we show here that notch 1 activation functions also through a second calcineurin-dependent mechanism acting on the p21 tata box-proximal region. increased calcineurin/nfat activity by notch signaling involves downregulation of calcipressin, an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor, through a hes-1-dependent mechanism. besides control of the p21 gene, calcineurin contributes significantly to the transcriptional response of keratinocytes to notch 1 activation, both in vitro and in vivo. in fact, deletion of the calcineurin b1 gene in the skin results in a cyclic alopecia phenotype, associated with altered expression of notch-responsive genes involved in hair follicle structure and/or adhesion to the surrounding mesenchyme. thus, an important interconnection exists between notch 1 and calcineurin-nfat pathways in keratinocyte growth/differentiation control.
given a wireless network where some pairs of communication links interfere with each other, we study sufficient conditions for determining whether a given set of minimum bandwidth quality-of-service (qos) requirements can be satisfied. we are especially interested in algorithms which have low communication overhead and low processing complexity. the interference in the network is modeled using a conflict graph whose vertices correspond to the communication links in the network. two links are adjacent in this graph if and only if they interfere with each other due to being in the same vicinity and hence cannot be simultaneously active. the problem of scheduling the transmission of the various links is then essentially a fractional, weighted vertex coloring problem, for which upper bounds on the fractional chromatic number are sought using only localized information. we present some distributed algorithms for this problem, and discuss their worst-case performance. our results on this fundamental problem imply that for some well known classes of networks and interference models, the performance of these distributed algorithms is within a bounded factor away from that of an optimal, centralized algorithm. the capacity of an arbitrary ad-hoc network is difficult to estimate due to interference between the links. we use a conflict graph that models this interference relationship to determine if a set of flow rates can be accommodated. using the cliques (complete subgraphs) of the conflict graph, we derive constraints that are sufficient for a set of flow rates to be feasible, yet are guaranteed to be within a constant bound of the optimal. we also compute an alternate set of sufficient constraints that can be easily derived from the rows of the matrix representation of the conflict graph. these two sets of constraints are particularly useful because their construction and verification may be distributed across the nodes of a network. we also extend the ad-hoc network model to incorporate variations in the interference range, and obstructions in the network.
we investigated the in vitro effects of arsenic trioxide on cell growth, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis in as4.1 juxtaglomerular cells. arsenic trioxide inhibited the growth of as4.1 cells with an ic(50) of approximately 5 microm. arsenic trioxide induced s phase arrest of the cell cycle and very efficiently stimulated apoptosis in as4.1 cells, as evidenced by flow cytometric detection of sub-g(1) dna content, annexin v binding assay, and 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. this apoptotic process was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)), a decrease in bcl-2, the activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase. however, all of the caspase inhibitors tested in this experiment failed to rescue as4.1 cells from arsenic trioxide-induced cell death in view of sub-g(1) cells and annexin v positive-staining cells. however, a caspase-8 inhibitor (z-ietd-fmk) noticeably decreased the loss of deltapsi(m) in arsenic trioxide-treated cells. when we examined the changes in reactive oxygen species (ros), h(2)o(2), or o(2)(*-) in arsenic trioxide-treated cells, h(2)o(2) was significantly decreased and o(2)(*-) was increased. in addition, we detected a decreased gsh content in arsenic trioxide-treated cells. taken together, we have demonstrated that arsenic trioxide as a ros generator potently inhibited the growth of as4.1 jg cells through s phase arrest of the cell cycle and caspase-independent apoptosis. low concentrations of as(2)o(3) (</=1 micromol/l) induce long-lasting remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl) without significant myelosuppressive side effects. several groups, including ours, have shown that 0.5 to 1 micromol/l as(2)o(3) induces apoptosis in apl-derived nb4 cells, whereas other leukemic cells are resistant to as(2)o(3) or undergo apoptosis only in response to greater than 2 micromol/l as(2)o(3). in this report, we show that the ability of as(2)o(3) to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells is dependent on the activity of the enzymes that regulate cellular h(2)o(2) content. thus, nb4 cells have relatively low levels of glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and catalase and have a constitutively higher h(2)o(2) content than u937 monocytic leukemia cells. glutathione-s-transferase pi (gstpi), which is important for cellular efflux of as(2)o(3), is also low in nb4 cells. moreover, as(2)o(3) further inhibits gpx activity and increases cellular h(2)o(2) content in nb4 but not in u937 cells. selenite pretreatment of nb4 cells increases the activity of gpx, lowers cellular h(2)o(2) levels, and renders nb4 cells resistant to 1 micromol/l as(2)o(3). in contrast, concentrations of as(2)o(3) that alone are not capable of inducing apoptosis in nb4 cells induce apoptosis in the presence of the gpx inhibitor mercaptosuccinic acid. similar effects are observed by modulating the activity of catalase with its inhibitor, aminotriazol. more important from a therapeutic point of view, u937 and hl-60 cells, which require high concentrations of as(2)o(3) to undergo apoptosis, become sensitive to low, clinically acceptable concentrations of as(2)o(3) when cotreated with these gpx and catalase inhibitors. the induction of apoptosis by as(2)o(3) involves an early decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in h(2)o(2) content, followed by cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, dna fragmentation, and the classic morphologic changes of apoptosis.
backgroundsince a long time, italy has maintained a dual system to administer childhood immunisations, that is a certain number of mandatory vaccinations and a number of recommended vaccinations. the study aimed to explore the issues surrounding parental acceptance or non-acceptance of the recommended vaccinations for children.methodsparents of children aged 3-5 years of day-care centres in sicily were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire. determinants of the attitude towards recommended vaccinations and social influence on the decision-making process were assessed using logistic regression analysis.resultsof the 1,500 selected parents, 81.0% participated in the study. prior to the survey, the majority of children (97.6%) received recommended vaccines. most parents (74.4%) received information about vaccinations from family paediatricians, showed a good knowledge about the side effects of the vaccines (73.1%), did not worry about their potential dangerousness (53.0%) and would have accepted their children to be vaccinated even if it was not required for day care (84.1%). the majority (79.9%) were not disposed to follow the advises of the anti-vaccination movements. parents' background characteristics, sources of information and social influence were not significantly associated with parental acceptance of recommended vaccines for childhood.conclusionsthis study suggests that health information by family paediatricians is significantly associated with parental acceptance of recommended vaccinations. background the rate of nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements has been increasing, and children with exemptions have contributed to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.   objectives to determine why parents claim nonmedical exemptions and to explore differences in perceptions of vaccines and vaccine information sources between parents of exempt and fully vaccinated children.   design case-control study.   setting colorado, massachusetts, missouri, and washington.   participants surveys were mailed to the parents of 815 exempt children (cases) and 1630 fully vaccinated children (controls randomly selected from the same grade and school) recruited from 112 private and public elementary schools. surveys were completed by 2435 parents (56.1%).   main outcome measures parental reports.   results most children (209 [75.5%] of 277) with nonmedical exemptions received at least some vaccines. the most common vaccine not received was varicella (147 [53.1%] of 277 exempt children). the most common reason stated for requesting exemptions (190 [69%] of 277) was concern that the vaccines might cause harm. parents of exempt children were significantly more likely than parents of vaccinated children to report low perceived vaccine safety and efficacy, a low level of trust in the government, and low perceived susceptibility to and severity of vaccine-preventable diseases. parents of exempt children were significantly less likely to report confidence in medical, public health, and government sources for vaccine information and were more likely to report confidence in alternative medicine professionals than parents of vaccinated children.   conclusion continued efforts must be made to educate parents about the utility and safety of vaccines, especially parents requesting nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements.
abstract the role of viral superinfection in hepatitis b surface antigen carriers with superimposed fulminant (n = 60) versus nonfulminant (n = 90) acute hepatitis was studied. the frequency of hepatitis a virus (hav) (0 versus 2.2%), hcv (18.3 versus 21.1%), hdv (15.0 versus 7.8%), and hev (1.7 versus 4.4%) infection showed no significant difference, while simultaneous hcv and hdv infection was significantly more prevalent in the former (8.3 versus 0%). only 3.6% of fulminant cases and 3.3% of nonfulminant controls were hgv rna positive. one hundred and thirty-four healthy subjects and 220 patients with liver diseases were studied for antibody to hepatitis a virus (anti-hav) with radio-immunoassay. the frequency of anti-hav related closely to the age of healthy subjects; the rate of positivity increased with age, being 5.9% in those under four years, 13.3% in the late first decade and over 90% after the third decade. taking meals at stalls with poor sanitary standards is suspected to cause the prevailing infection in teenagers, although a cohort effect due to environmental and socio-economic improvement can not be excluded. anti-hav was present in most patients with frequencies comparable to healthy subjects of the same age. it is concluded that in taiwan the prevalent chronic liver diseases and hepatocarcinoma are unrelated to hav infection and the patients are infected to an extent similar to healthy people of the same age.
while going deeper has been witnessed to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (cnn), going smaller for cnn has received increasing attention recently due to its attractiveness for mobile/embedded applications. it remains an active and important topic how to design a small network while retaining the performance of large and deep cnns (e.g., inception nets, resnets). albeit there are already intensive studies on compressing the size of cnns, the considerable drop of performance is still a key concern in many designs. this paper addresses this concern with several new contributions. first, we propose a simple yet powerful method for compressing the size of deep cnns based on parameter binarization. the striking difference from most previous work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different treatments of $1\times 1$ convolutions and $k\times k$ convolutions ($k>1$), where we only binarize $k\times k$ convolutions into binary patterns. the resulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. by doing this, we show that previous deep cnns such as googlenet and inception-type nets can be compressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. second, in light of the different functionalities of $1\times 1$ (data projection/transformation) and $k\times k$ convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block structure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature maps generated by $1\times 1$ convolutions to the pattern feature maps generated by $k\times k$ convolutions, based on which we design a small network with $\sim 1$ million parameters. combining with our parameter binarization, we achieve better performance on imagenet than using similar sized networks including recently released google mobilenets. the explosion of image data on the internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. but exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. we introduce here a new database called “imagenet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the wordnet structure. imagenet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of wordnet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. this will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of wordnet. this paper offers a detailed analysis of imagenet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. we show that imagenet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. we describe the data collection scheme with amazon mechanical turk. lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of imagenet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. we hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of imagenet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.
acetaminophen (apap) overdose causes acute liver failure in humans and rodents due in part to the destruction of mitochondria as a result of increased oxidative stress followed by hepatocellular necrosis. activation of the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (pparα), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that controls the expression of genes encoding peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid β‐oxidation enzymes, with the experimental ligand wy‐14,643 or the clinically used fibrate drug fenofibrate, fully protects mice from apap‐induced hepatotoxicity. pparα‐humanized mice were also protected, whereas ppara‐null mice were not, thus indicating that the protection extends to human pparα and is pparα‐dependent. this protection is due in part to induction of the pparα target gene encoding mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (ucp2). forced overexpression of ucp2 protected wildtype mice against apap‐induced hepatotoxicity in the absence of pparα activation. ucp2‐null mice, however, were sensitive to apap‐induced hepatotoxicity despite activation of pparα with wy‐14,643. protection against hepatotoxicity by ucp2‐induction through activation of pparα is associated with decreased apap‐induced c‐jun and c‐fos expression, decreased phosphorylation of jnk and c‐jun, lower mitochondrial h2o2 levels, increased mitochondrial glutathione in liver, and decreased levels of circulating fatty acyl‐carnitines. these studies indicate that the pparα target gene ucp2 protects against elevated reactive oxygen species generated during drug‐induced hepatotoxicity and suggest that induction of ucp2 may also be a general mechanism for protection of mitochondria during fatty acid β‐oxidation. (hepatology 2012;56:281–290) metabolic bioactivation, glutathione depletion, and covalent binding are the early hallmark events after acetaminophen (apap) overdose. however, the subsequent metabolic consequences contributing to apap-induced hepatic necrosis and apoptosis have not been fully elucidated. in this study, serum metabolomes of control and apap-treated wild-type and cyp2e1-null mice were examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) and multivariate data analysis. a dose-response study showed that the accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines in serum contributes to the separation of wild-type mice undergoing apap-induced hepatotoxicity from other mouse groups in a multivariate model. this observation, in conjunction with the increase of triglycerides and free fatty acids in the serum of apap-treated wild-type mice, suggested that apap treatment can disrupt fatty acid beta-oxidation. a time-course study further indicated that both wild-type and cyp2e1-null mice had their serum acylcarnitine levels markedly elevated within the early hours of apap treatment. while remaining high in wild-type mice, serum acylcarnitine levels gradually returned to normal in cyp2e1-null mice at the end of the 24 h treatment. distinct from serum aminotransferase activity and hepatic glutathione levels, the pattern of serum acylcarnitine accumulation suggested that acylcarnitines can function as complementary biomarkers for monitoring the apap-induced hepatotoxicity. an essential role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (pparalpha) in the regulation of serum acylcarnitine levels was established by comparing the metabolomic responses of wild-type and ppara-null mice to a fasting challenge. the upregulation of pparalpha activity following apap treatment was transient in wild-type mice but was much more prolonged in cyp2e1-null mice. overall, serum metabolomics of apap-induced hepatotoxicity revealed that the cyp2e1-mediated metabolic activation and oxidative stress following apap treatment can cause irreversible inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, potentially through suppression of pparalpha-regulated pathways.
background altered expression of mir-503 has been linked to human carcinogenesis. in this present study, we aimed to detect the potential for mir-503 as a novel biomarker for gastric cancer (gc) patients. materials and methods the relative mrna level of mir-503 in serum and tissue of 68 gc patients and serum of 32 healthy volunteers was determined by real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. results the mir-503 level was significantly lower in the tissue and serum of gc than their counterparts (all p<0.01). downregulation of mir-503 was found to be corrected with more aggressive tumor. patients in the high-mir-503 group showed significantly better overall survival compared to the low-mir-503 group (p=0.021). the serum mir-503 level in gc was inversely correlated with carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) (r=−0.624, p<0.001). furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for mir-503 discriminating gc patients from healthy individuals was 0.889 (p=0.006), with a sensitivity of 96.8% and a specificity of 79.4%, higher than that of cea (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve =0.681, p=0.048). conclusion the present study suggests that the expression level of mir-503 may serve as prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for gc. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt) is believed to be associated with cancer cell malignancy, and also to cause cancer invasion and metastasis. recent evidence indicates that small non-protein coding rna [micrornas (mirnas/mirs)] may act as powerful regulators of emt. the present study aimed to systematically delineate mir-503 expression in gastric cancer and analyse the function of mir-503 in gastric cancer emt. in the present study, mir-503 expression was detected in gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. gastric cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation capabilities were analysed by transwell, mtt and clonability assays. the expression of mesenchymal markers, including fibronectin, vimentin, n-cadherin, snail and the epithelial marker, e-cadherin, was examined by immunoblot analysis following mir-503 transfection. mir-503 expression was found to be reduced in gastric cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric mucosa cell lines, and the expression of mir-503 was upregulated in non-metastatic-derived gastric cancer cell lines compared with metastatic-derived lines. mir-503 expression levels were significantly reduced in tumour tissues in comparison with adjacent normal mucosa tissues, and the mir-503 expression levels in patients with metastases were significantly lower than those in patients without. mir-503 inhibited gastric cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation. fibronectin, vimentin, n-cadherin and snail protein levels were decreased, but e-cadherin expression was increased in an ags cell line transfected with mir-503. taken together, the present findings indicate that mir-503 acts as a novel tumour suppressor gene in gastric cancer and can inhibit emt in gastric cancer cells.
the existence of association between hyperhomocysteinaemia (hhc) and schizophrenia has been suggested by several recent studies. this study aimed to determine the prevalence of hhc and its main determinants, and sought a correlation with clinical features in tunisian patients with schizophrenia. plasma homocysteine (hcy), folate, and vitamin b12, as well as the c677t methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) polymorphism, were studied in 33 patients with schizophrenia, all free from antipsychotic treatment, and 35 age- and smoking-habit-matched healthy subjects as controls. biochemical determinations and psychometric evaluations were carried out in patients before the administration of antipsychotics. the prevalence of hhc was higher and plasma b12 vitamin was significantly lower in patients. there was no significant difference in genotypic distribution and allelic frequency of the c677t mthfr polymorphism between groups. hcy was significantly correlated to the 'anhedonia-asociality' subscales of the scale for the assessment of negative symptoms (sans). this study showed an association between hhc and schizophrenia, especially with the negative symptoms of the disease. in the tunisian population, hhc in schizophrenia seems to be linked to vitamin b12 deficiency, likely caused by a lack of dietary animal proteins. background an increased risk of both schizophrenia and neural tube defects was observed in a birth cohort exposed to famine during early gestation. neural tube defects have been related to a folate-sensitive genetic defect in homocysteine metabolism. if this were also true for schizophrenia, then cases with low folate (lf)--and only these cases--should have increased homocysteine levels compared with controls.   methods we compared homocysteine levels of schizophrenia cases and normal controls with low folate (lf) and without low folate (non-lf). low folate was defined by the bottom tertile for controls.   results in the lf group (6 cases, 8 controls), mean homocysteine was 10.7 microm in cases compared with 7.7 microm in controls (p = .03). in the non-lf group (11 cases, 16 controls) mean homocysteine did not differ for cases and controls.   conclusions these pilot data are compatible with the hypothesis that a folate-sensitive defect in homocysteine metabolism contributes to cases of schizophrenia.
objective: to evaluate correlation of leptinemia with components of metabolic syndrome (mets) in moroccan youths, and effect of obesity, blood pressure (bp), gender and puberty stage on mets-components. study design: anthropomorphic, metabolic and clinical parameters [body mass index (bmi), waist circumference (wc), energy intake, blood pressure (bp), plasma levels of lipids, leptin, alanine-amino transferase (alt), apo-b, uric acid (ua), glucose, insulin and insulin resistance (ir) (homeostasis-model-assessment (homa-ir) and fcβ (intra hepatic-ir)] were determined in 82 obese and 51 non-obese, male and female youths at different stages of puberty. results: obesity was a major but not the only determinant of levels of leptin, bp, triglycerides, insulin, ua and alt, and homa-ir, fcβ; bmi was correlated with wc, bp and ua. girls had higher leptin levels than boys, irrespective of obesity. higher puberty stage was associated with higher values of bp, leptin, and alt, irrespective of gender. leptinemia was correlated with mets-components: bmi, wc, bp, cholesterol, triglycerides, apo-b, insulin, ua and homa-ir in all subjects; 10.8 16.2% of obese youths had mets. conclusions: leptinemia was correlated with several mets-components. hyperleptinemia in youths, indicating leptin resistance and ir, could predict development of mets and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. early detection of mets may be helpful in identifying those at risk for t2dm and cv disease, and preventive measures may be protect them from development of metabolic and cardiac disorders in the future. *corresponding author: a. touzani, children’s hospital of morocco and laboratory of biochemistry and molecular biology, faculty of medicine and pharmacy, rabat, morocco, tel: 212-37-84398; fax: 212-7-77-37 01; e-mail: asmaetouzani@hotmail.com we studied serum leptin levels in 189 healthy children to evaluate related factors during childhood and adolescence. leptin correlated with body mass index (bmi), triceps skinfold thickness (p<0.001) and body weight (p<0.01). obese children and girls had higher leptin levels than non-obese children and boys, respectively (p<0.001). in girls, leptin correlated positively with age, skinfold thickness and bmi (p<0.001). in boys, leptin correlated negatively with age (p<0.001) and positively with skinfold thickness (p<0.05). prepubertal boys had higher leptin levels than prepubertal girls and pubertal boys (p<0.05). pubertal girls had higher leptin levels than prepubertal girls and pubertal boys (p<0.001). leptin levels in girls were higher at tanner stages 4 and 5 than at stage 1 (p<0.001). in conclusion, serum leptin levels are related with adiposity, have obviously age-related gender differences during childhood and adolescence, and may be involved in the maturation of reproductive capacity.
objectivedecreased expression of inwardly rectifying potassium (kir) channels in astrocytes and glioma cells may contribute to impaired k+ buffering and increased propensity for seizures. here, we evaluated the potential effect of inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-1β (il-1β) on kir4.1 mrna and protein expression.methodswe investigated kir4.1 (kcnj10) and il-1β mrna expression in the temporal cortex in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy 24 h and 1 week after induction of status epilepticus (se), using real-time pcr and western blot analysis. the u373 glioblastoma cell line and human fetal astrocytes were used to study the regulation of kir4.1 expression in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. expression of kir4.1 protein was also evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry in surgical specimens of patients with astrocytic tumors (n = 64), comparing the expression in tumor patients with (n = 38) and without epilepsy (n = 26).resultstwenty-four hours after onset of se, kir4.1 mrna and protein were significantly down-regulated in temporal cortex of epileptic rats. this decrease in expression was followed by a return to control level at 1 week after se. the transient downregulation of kir4.1 corresponded to the time of prominent upregulation of il-1β mrna. expression of kir4.1 mrna and protein in glial cells in culture was downregulated after exposure to il-1β. evaluation of kir4.1 in tumor specimens showed a significantly lower kir4.1 expression in the specimens of patients with epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy. this paralleled the increased presence of activated microglial cells, as well as the increased expression of il-1β and the cytoplasmic translocation of high mobility group box 1 (hmgb1).conclusionstaken together, these findings indicate that alterations in expression of kir4.1 occurring in epilepsy-associated lesions are possibly influenced by the local inflammatory environment and in particular by the inflammatory cytokine il-1β. a department of neuroscience, mario negri institute for pharmacological research, via g. la masa 19, 20156 milano, italy b department (neuro) pathology, academisch medisch centrum, amsterdam, the netherlands c the netherlands foundation (stichting epilepsie instellingen nederland), heemstede, the netherlands d department of pediatrics, david geffen school of medicine at ucla, los angeles, ca, usa e hotchkiss brain institute, university of calgary, calgary, alberta, canada
the aim of the study was to determine whether there are differences in dental age (da) using the method of demirjian, in patients with impacted buccal or palatal maxillary canines in relation to unaffected controls. da was estimated using demirjian's method on panoramic radiographs of two groups of caucasian patients. the study group consisted of 116 patients aged from 12 to 16 years (80 females and 36 males) that was further divided into 54 patients with unilateral or bilateral palatally impacted maxillary canines and 62 patients with buccally positioned canines. the control group of 116 subjects without canine impaction was matched to the study group by age and gender. calculated das and differences between dental and chronological age (ca) were compared between the groups. statistical analysis was performed using shapiro-wilk, mann-whitney u, and student's t-test. da was significantly lower in patients with impacted maxillary canines than in healthy controls and also when palatal or buccal ectopia was considered. the rate of dental development in patients with palatally impacted canines did not differ from that of subjects with buccal canine displacement. the differences between da and ca were higher in healthy controls (increase in da) than in patients with impacted maxillary canines. da estimation using demirjian's method may be lower than expected in subjects with maxillary canine impaction. an etiologic connection between palatally ectopic canines and small and missing teeth is well established in the literature. additionally, it has been observed that patients with palatally ectopic canines have a delayed dental development. the present study was designed to examine the validity of this latter observation. we radiographically assessed the subjects' dental ages using criteria of tooth calcification, rather than tooth eruption pattern. a similar determination was made in relation to subjects in whom buccally ectopic canines were present. the experimental group consisted of panoramic radiographs of 55 consecutively treated patients with palatally displaced maxillary canines and of 47 consecutively treated patients with buccally displaced canines. they were compared with a control group of 57 consecutively treated patients with normally placed canines. approximately half the subjects with palatal displacement exhibited a late-developing dentition, whereas the timing of dentition in the remaining subjects appeared to be normal. buccal displacement was not associated with a retarded dental development, and the ranges of the dental age values were similar to those seen in the control group. the results support the idea that there are different etiologies for the occurrence of buccal versus palatal ectopia in maxillary canines. they also suggest that dentitions with a palatal canine appear to be of 2 distinct varieties, with different dental characteristics and, perhaps, different etiologies.
approximations based on random fourier features have recently emerged as an efficient and formally consistent methodology to design large-scale kernel machines. by expressing the kernel as a fourier expansion, features are generated based on a finite set of random basis projections, sampled from the fourier transform of the kernel, with inner products that are monte carlo approximations of the original kernel. based on the observation that different kernel-induced fourier sampling distributions correspond to different kernel parameters, we show that an optimization process in the fourier domain can be used to identify the different frequency bands that are useful for prediction on training data. moreover, the application of group lasso to random feature vectors corresponding to a linear combination of multiple kernels, leads to efficient and scalable reformulations of the standard multiple kernel learning model \cite{varma09}. in this paper we develop the linear fourier approximation methodology for both single and multiple gradient-based kernel learning and show that it produces fast and accurate predictors on a complex dataset such as the visual object challenge 2011 (voc2011). recent advances in multiple kernel learning (mkl) have positioned it as an attractive tool for tackling many supervised learning tasks. the development of efficient gradient descent based optimization schemes has made it possible to tackle large scale problems. simultaneously, mkl based algorithms have achieved very good results on challenging real world applications. yet, despite their successes, mkl approaches are limited in that they focus on learning a linear combination of given base kernels.  in this paper, we observe that existing mkl formulations can be extended to learn general kernel combinations subject to general regularization. this can be achieved while retaining all the efficiency of existing large scale optimization algorithms. to highlight the advantages of generalized kernel learning, we tackle feature selection problems on benchmark vision and uci databases. it is demonstrated that the proposed formulation can lead to better results not only as compared to traditional mkl but also as compared to state-of-the-art wrapper and filter methods for feature selection.
successful object recognition is essential for finding food, identifying kin, and avoiding danger, as well as many other adaptive behaviors. to accomplish this feat, the visual system must reconstruct 3-d interpretations from 2-d “snapshots” falling on the retina. theories of recognition address this process by focusing on the question of how object representations are encoded with respect to viewpoint. although empirical evidence has been equivocal on this question, a growing body of surprising results, including those obtained in the experiments presented in this case study, indicates that recognition is often viewpoint dependent. such findings reveal a prominent role for viewpointdependent mechanisms and provide support for themultiple-views approach, in which objects are encoded as a set of view-specific representations that are matched to percepts using normalization procedures. this study examined two related phenomena: (a) the judgment of whether a human body part belongs to the left or right half of the body and (b) the imagined spatial transformation of one's body. in three experiments, observers made left-right judgments of a part of a body whose orientation differed from their own by a rotation about one of 13 axes. to do so, they imagined themselves passing to the orientation of the stimulus. time for (a) left-right judgments and (b) accompanying imagined spatial transformations depended on the extent of the orientation difference (od) between the observer and stimulus. more important, time for phenomena (a) and (b) depended strongly, and in the same way, on the direction of od. further results showed that the rate of imagined spatial transformations can vary strongly for different axes and directions of rotation about an axis. these and other results (e.g., parsons, 1987a) suggest that temporal and kinematic properties of imagined spatial transformations are more object-specific than could be previously assumed.
trypanosoma cruzi expresses several proteins containing antigenic amino acid repeats. here we characterized tcrpl7a and tcrbp28, which carry similar repeat motifs and share homology to the eukaryotic l7a ribosomal protein and to a trypanosoma brucei rna binding protein, respectively. analyses of the full length and truncated recombinant tcrpl7a showed that the humoral response of patients with chagas disease is directed towards its repetitive domain. sequence analyses of distinct copies of tcrpl7a genes present in the genome of six t. cruzi strains indicate that the number of repeats is higher in proteins from t. cruzi ii than t. cruzi i strains. a serum panel of 59 t. cruzi infected patients showed that 73% reacted with tcrpl7a, 71% reacted with tcrbp28 and 80% reacted with 1:1 mixture of both antigens. synthetic peptides harboring the tcrpl7a repeat motif reacted with 46% of the serum samples. antibodies raised against both antigens identified equivalent amounts of the native proteins in all three stages of the parasite life cycle. analyses of subcellular fractions indicated that tcrbp28 is present in the cytoplasm whereas tcrpl7a co-fractionates with polysomes. confirming their predicted cellular localization, gfp fusions showed that, whereas gfp::tcrbp28 localizes in the cytoplasm, gfp::tcrpl7a accumulates in the nucleus, where ribosome biogenesis occurs. the human ribosomal protein l7a is a component of the major ribosomal subunit. we transiently expressed in hela cells l7a-β-galactosidase fusion proteins and studied their subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti-β-galactosidase antibodies. we have identified three distinct domains responsible for the nuclear targeting of the protein: domain i, amino acids 23-51; domain ii, amino acids 52-100; domain iii, amino acids 101-220, each of which contains at least one nuclear localization signal (nls). through subcellular localization analysis of deletion mutants of l7a-β-galactosidase chimeras, we demonstrate that domain ii plays a special role because it is necessary, although not sufficient, to target the chimeric β-galactosidase to the nucleoli. in fact, we demonstrate that the nucleolar targeting process requires the presence of domain ii plus an additional basic domain that can be represented by an nls or a basic stretch of amino acids without nls activity. thus, when multiple nls are present, each nls exerts distinct functions. domain ii drives nucleolar accumulation of a reporter protein with the cooperative action of a short basic amino acid sequence, suggesting a mechanism requiring protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions.
backgrounddysregulation of the insulin-like growth factor (igf) system, a common consequence of adiposity-induced insulin resistance, may be a key underlying mechanism linking excess body weight with colon cancer. evidence has been derived from studies of cancer and polyps. supporting data about aberrant crypt foci (acf), putative pre-polyp changes, have been generated only from animal studies to date.methodswe randomly selected 26 patients with sex-specific elevated waist-hip-ratio (whr) and 26 with normal values from a series of 150 patients seeking routine colonoscopy at the university of connecticut health center. cross-sectional analyses were performed of acf number (<5, ≥5) in relation to total igf1, igf-binding protein-3 (igfbp3), insulin, body mass index (bmi), whr and waist circumference (wc). visualized acf in the 20 cm of the distal colon were counted using advanced endoscopic imaging.resultspatients with ≥5 acf had higher bmi, whr, and wc compared with patients with >5 acf (p = 0.04, p = 0.03, and p = 0.01, respectively). igfbp3 was reduced (p = 0.02) and igf1:igfbp3 molar ratio was greater (p = 0.03) in patients with ≥5 acf. we did not observe significant associations between acf number and insulin or total igf1.conclusionsour study provides the first report in humans of a possible association of acf prevalence and igf1 bioavailability as characterized by igf1:igfbp3 molar ratio and igfbp3 level. more research is needed to determine whether this relationship is varied by acf features (e.g., size, dysplasia, molecular changes), synchronous cancer and polyps, and is modified by colon cancer risk factors. there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. the phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. this review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. the genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. these include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. a number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. these pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
abstract plasmodium berghei-infected mice, a well-recognized model of experimental cerebral malaria (ecm), exhibit many of the hallmarks of a systemic inflammatory response, with organ damage in brain, lung, and kidneys. identification of the molecules mediating pathogenesis of the inflammatory response, such as leukocyte adhesion, may lead to new therapies. indeed, mice lacking the cell adhesion molecule p-selectin were significantly (p = 0.005) protected from death due to p. berghei malaria compared with c57bl/6 controls despite similar parasitemia (p = 0.6) being found in both groups of mice. p-selectin levels assessed by the quantitative dual radiolabeled monoclonal antibody technique increased significantly (p < 0.05) in several organs in c57bl/6 mice infected with p. berghei, supporting the concept of a systemic inflammatory response mediating malarial pathogenesis. intravital microscopic analysis of the brain microvasculature demonstrated significant (p < 0.001) leukocyte rolling and adhesion in brain venules of p. berghei-infected mice compared with those found in uninfected controls. the maximum leukocyte adhesion occurred on day 6 of p. berghei infection, when the mice become moribund and exhibit marked vascular leakage into the brain, lung, and heart. however, p-selectin levels were significantly (p < 0.005) increased in brain, lung, and kidneys during p. berghei malaria in ecm-resistant balb/c mice compared with those found in uninfected balb/c controls, indicating that increased p-selectin alone is not sufficient to mediate malarial pathogenesis. leukocyte adhesion to brain microvessels of p-selectin-deficient mice with p. berghei malaria was similar to that observed in control mice. collectively, these results indicate that p-selectin is important for the development of malarial pathogenesis but is not required for leukocyte adhesion in brain. we determined the requirement for selected lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in the pathogenesis of experimental murine cerebral malaria (cm) by using gene-targeted knockout and mab-suppressed mice. plasmodium berghei anka infection induced cm in a 0/0 mice, which lack expression of surface mhc class ii glycoproteins and consequently express a severe and chronic reduction in numbers of cd4+ t cells. however, when a 0/0 mice, which are on a c57bl/6 x 129 genetic background, or immune-intact c57bl/6 controls treated with anti-cd4 mab were infected, none developed cm. the latter finding confirms an earlier report that cd4+ t cells are required for cm to occur and additionally indicates that the reduced numbers of cd4+ t cells present in a 0/0 mice are sufficient for cm development. neither the recently described cd4+, nk1.1+ t cell subset shown to be present in a 0/0 mice nor traditional nk cells seem to be required for the induction of cm because a 0/0 and c57bl/6 mice severely depleted of both nk1.1+ populations with mab developed cm as readily as did normal ig-treated controls. deficiency of th1-associated cytokines (ifn-gamma or il-2) in mice by gene-targeted disruptions completely inhibited cm development, whereas the lack of th2-associated cytokines (il-4 or il-10) did not prevent this disease. our observation that b cell-deficient jhd and micromt mice developed cm provides evidence that neither b cells, their products, nor b cell ag presentation are a requisite for cm pathology. we further observed that neither beta 2m 0/0 knockout mice, which lack cd8+ alpha beta t cells, nor c57bl/6 mice depleted of cd8+ t cells with anti-cd8 mab treatment developed cm, leading us to conclude that cd8+ t cells are also crucial for the development of cm.
introduction and hypothesisalthough there is no consensus on the management of persistent or recurrent stress urinary incontinence (sui) after placement of a midurethral synthetic sling (mus), a repeat mus procedure is commonly performed with favorable results. the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a repeat mus procedure compared to the primary procedure in women with sui, and to investigate factors associated with the failure of the repeat procedure.methodswe retrospectively analyzed data from 53 women who underwent a repeat mus procedure and 102 women who underwent a primary mus procedure at a single center. success was defined as no urine leakage during physical activity based on the sandvik questionnaire. outcomes were assessed using the sandvik severity index and incontinence-quality of life (i-qol) questionnaire. multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors predicting failure of the repeat procedure.resultsthe success rate was 76.5 % for the primary mus procedure (78/102 patients) and 69.8 % for the repeat mus procedure (37/53 patients; p = 0.369). the mean follow-up duration was significantly longer for the primary procedure (83.8 months vs. 54.6 months, p < 0.001). sui and all domain scores of the i-qol were significantly better following the repeat mus procedure than following the primary procedure. in the multivariate analysis, sui grade 3 was the only independent factor predicting failure of the repeat qq (odds ratio 7.610, p = 0.023).conclusionsa repeat mus procedure after a failed primary mus procedure was shown to be effective. however, a repeat procedure may be unsuccessful in patients with grade 3 sui. background data about the use of tension-free vaginal tape (tvt) in the management of recurrent urodynamic stress incontinence (rusi) after previous failed midurethral sling procedure (musp) are limited.   objective assessment of the efficacy and the indications of the tvt procedure in the management of patients with rusi after failed previous musp.   design, setting, and participants thirty-one patients with rusi after previous failed musp were prospectively enrolled at a single tertiary academic center.   measurements preoperatively and postoperatively, patients were assessed with physical examination, urinalysis, urine culture, bladder diary for 2-3 d, q-tip test, uroflow, filling and voiding cystometry, urethral profilometry, and 1-h pad test. mean follow-up was at 18.6 mo (range: 12-28 mo).   results and limitations overall, the objective cure rate based on the pad test findings was 74%, the improvement rate was 6.5%, and the failure rate was 19.5%. the objective cure rate based on cough stress test during filling cystometry was 77.4%, and the subjective cure rate based on patients' answers was 71%. the study could have some limitations. the relatively small number of patients enrolled could affect the findings of study to some degree. additionally, because urethral pressure profiles show a significant degree of directional dependence when side-hole microtip transducers are used, as in the present study, the orientation of the transducer could affect the values measured.   conclusions the tvt procedure as a second operation could provide an overall cure rate of 74% with a low complication rate in female patients with rusi after previous failed midurethral tape procedures.
impaired temporal control is symptomatic of several neurological disorders; recently, it has been implicated in schizophrenia. an animal model of schizophrenia using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) infused to the medial pre-frontal cortex (mpfc) was employed to examine its effects on temporal control. twelve rats were trained on a peak-interval procedure (pip) until stable patterns of behavior were obtained. rats infused with 6-ohda responded less during peak trials and their peak functions were flatter than sham rats. these results are consistent with similar studies with transgenic mice with increased striatal dopamine d2 receptor activity. lesions in the mpfc decreased motivation to respond in a pip. these effects may be considered analogous to negative symptoms of schizophrenia. highlights ► the effect of timing behaviour on cortical and striatal fos expression was examined. ► rats trained on the peak procedure (fipp) and a control schedule were compared. ► fos expression in the orbital pfc was enhanced following exposure to the fipp. ► fos expression in the striatum did not differ between rats trained on the two tasks. ► the results suggest that the orbital pfc is involved in interval timing behaviour.
iodine is the main constituent of thyroid hormones, which in turn are required for fetal brain development. however, the relation between iodine intake during pregnancy, thyroid function, and child neurodevelopment needs further evaluation. the authors assessed the association of maternal iodine intake from diet and supplements during pregnancy and of maternal and neonatal thyroid function with infant neurodevelopment. the mental development index and psychomotor development index (pdi) for 691 children were obtained between 2005 and 2007 using the bayley scales of infant development at age 1 year in a prebirth cohort in valencia, spain. in multivariate analyses, a maternal thyrotropin level >4 μu/ml was associated with an increased risk of a pdi <85 (odds ratio = 3.5, p = 0.02). maternal intake of ≥150 μg/day, compared with <100 μg/day, of iodine from supplements was associated with a 5.2-point decrease in pdi (95% confidence interval: -8.1, -2.2) and a 1.8-fold increase in the odds of a pdi <85 (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 3.3). when analyses were stratified by sex, this association was intensified for girls but was not observed for boys. further evidence on the safety and effectiveness of iodine supplementation during pregnancy is needed before it is systematically recommended in iodine-sufficient or mildly deficient areas. context thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development. limited data are available regarding whether thyroid function in neonates influences later cognitive development.   objective our objective was to study associations of newborn t4 levels with maternal thyroid function and childhood cognition.   design and setting we studied participants in project viva, a cohort study in massachusetts.   participants we studied a total of 500 children born 1999--2003 at 34 wk or more.   main outcome measures we determined cognitive test scores at ages 6 months and 3 yr.   results mean newborn t4 at a mean age of 1.94 d was 17.6 (sd 4.0) microg/dl, and levels were higher in girls [1.07 microg/dl; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.38, 1.76] and infants born after longer gestation (0.42 microg/dl; 95% ci 0.17, 0.67 per wk). newborn t4 levels were not associated with maternal t4, tsh, or thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. on multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, higher newborn t4 was unexpectedly associated with poorer scores on the visual recognition memory test among infants at age 6 months (-0.5; 95% ci -0.9, -0.2), but not with scores at age 3 yr on either the peabody picture vocabulary test (0.2; 95% ci -0.1, 0.5) or the wide range assessment of visual motor abilities (0.1; 95% ci -0.2, 0.3). maternal thyroid function test results were not associated with child cognitive test scores.   conclusions newborn t4 concentrations within a normal physiological reference range are not associated with maternal thyroid function and do not predict cognitive outcome in a population living in an iodine-sufficient area.
urinary albumin is an important biomarker used to identify high risk patients with diabetes, but there is a need for new biomarkers that alone or in combination with urinary albumin could give an even better prediction of clinical patient outcomes. one promising biomarker is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoguo) that represents intracellular oxidative stress. we investigated the ability of microalbuminuria (ma) and urinary 8-oxoguo, alone and in combination, to predict mortality and cardiovascular disease (cvd) in patients with type 2 diabetes. we used data from 1381 newly diagnosed diabetes patients, and urinary albumin and 8-oxoguo were assessed in morning urine collected at the time of diabetes diagnosis and at a follow-up visit 6 years later. associations between the urinary markers and mortality and cvd were assessed in cox proportional hazards regression models. test performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 10-year mortality and 10-year incidence of cvd. both 8-oxoguo and urinary albumin were statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality at diagnosis as well as at 6-year follow-up. at diagnosis only urinary albumin was associated with cvd. in contrast, only 8-oxoguo was associated with cvd at 6-year follow-up. when investigating test performance, we found that by combining information from ma and 8-oxoguo the ability to correctly identify patients at risk could be improved. the findings suggest that measurement of urinary 8-oxoguo provides additional information about risk to that obtained from urinary albumin, and that the combined use of 8-oxoguo and urinary albumin could be useful for a better identification of patients at risk of cvd and death. background—for the general population, the clinical relevance of an increased urinary albumin excretion rate is still debated. therefore, we examined the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and all-cause mortality and mortality caused by cardiovascular (cv) disease and non-cv disease in the general population. methods and results—in the period 1997 to 1998, all inhabitants of the city of groningen, the netherlands, aged between 28 and 75 years (n=85 421) were sent a postal questionnaire collecting information about risk factors for cv disease and cv morbidity and a vial to collect an early morning urine sample for measurement of urinary albumin concentration (uac). the vital status of the cohort was subsequently obtained from the municipal register, and the cause of death was obtained from the central bureau of statistics. of these 85 421 subjects, 40 856 (47.8%) responded, and 40 548 could be included in the analysis. during a median follow-up period of 961 days (maximum 1139 days), 516 deaths with known cause were recorded. we found a positive dose-response relationship between increasing uac and mortality. a higher uac increased the risk of both cv and non-cv death after adjustment for other well-recognized cv risk factors, with the increase being significantly higher for cv mortality than for non-cv mortality (p =0.014). a 2-fold increase in uac was associated with a relative risk of 1.29 for cv mortality (95% ci 1.18 to 1.40) and 1.12 (95% ci 1.04 to 1.21) for non-cv mortality. conclusions—urinary albumin excretion is a predictor of all-cause mortality in the general population. the excess risk was more attributable to death from cv causes, independent of the effects of other cv risk factors, and the relationship was already apparent at levels of albuminuria currently considered to be normal.
background childhood cancer survivors (ccs) are at increased risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms, including gastrointestinal (gi) cancer. we performed a systematic review to summarize all available literature on the risk of, risk factors for, and outcome after subsequent gi cancer among ccs.   methods a systematic search of the literature databases medline/pubmed (1945-2014) and embase (1947-2014) was performed to identify studies that consisted of ⩾1000 ccs and assessed incidence of or mortality from subsequent gi cancer as an outcome.   results a total of 45 studies were included. studies that reported risk measures for subsequent gi cancer compared to the general population showed a 3.2 to 9.7-fold elevated risk in cohort studies including all childhood cancer types. abdominal radiotherapy was associated with an increased risk of subsequent gi cancer in all four studies that assessed this risk. survivors who had received procarbazine and platinum agents were also suggested to be at increased risk.   conclusion abdominal radiotherapy is a risk factor for developing a subsequent gi cancer. few studies examined detailed treatment-related risk factors and most studies had small number of gi cancer cases. therefore, no conclusions could be drawn on the effect of time since childhood cancer on gi cancer risk and on outcome after a subsequent gi cancer. additional research is necessary to further explore risk factors for and outcome after a subsequent gi cancer, and to systematically evaluate the harms and benefits of gi screening among high-risk survivors in order to give sound screening recommendations. background although elevated risks of pancreatic cancer have been observed in long-term survivors of hodgkin lymphoma (hl), no prior study has assessed the risk of second pancreatic cancer in relation to radiation dose and specific chemotherapeutic agents.   patients and methods we conducted an international case-control study within a cohort of 19 882 hl survivors diagnosed from 1953 to 2003 including 36 cases and 70 matched controls.   results median ages at hl and pancreatic cancer diagnoses were 47 and 60.5 years, respectively; median time to pancreatic cancer was 19 years. pancreatic cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose to the pancreatic tumor location (ptrend = 0.005) and increasing number of alkylating agent (aa)-containing cycles of chemotherapy (ptrend = 0.008). the odds ratio (or) for patients treated with both subdiaphragmatic radiation (≥10 gy) and ≥6 aa-containing chemotherapy cycles (13 cases, 6 controls) compared with patients with neither treatment was 17.9 (95% confidence interval 3.5-158). the joint effect of these two treatments was significantly greater than additive (p = 0.041) and nonsignificantly greater than multiplicative (p = 0.29). especially high risks were observed among patients receiving ≥8400 mg/m(2) of procarbazine with nitrogen mustard or ≥3900 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide.   conclusion our study demonstrates for the first time that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy substantially increase pancreatic cancer risks among hl survivors treated in the past. these findings extend the range of nonhematologic cancers associated with chemotherapy and add to the evidence that the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can lead to especially large risks.
aim: to examine and compare the prevalence of morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae in children with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate and in children without a cleft. subjects and method: the cleft group consisted of 325 children (150 girls and 175 boys) born with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (mean age 11.1 years). the control group consisted of 325 children without a cleft, matched on age and gender. lateral cephalograms exposing upper cervical vertebrae (c1 c3) were examined regarding morphological anomalies such as posterior arch deficiencies, fusion anomalies, odontoid anomalies and vertebral artery canal. results: the prevalence of morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae was 24.3 per cent (n=79) in children with cleft and 12.6 per cent (n=41) in children without a cleft. the occurrence of cervical vertebral anomalies in children with clefts were two times more often in comparison with the children without a cleft (p<0.001). posterior arch deficiency and vertebral fusion were found to occur significantly more often in children with cleft (p<0.001). no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding odontoid anomalies and vertebral artery canal. conclusion: morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae occurred in children with clefts significantly more often in comparison with the children without a cleft. objective: to investigate anatomical variations and abnormalities of cervical spine morphology in unoperated infants with cleft lip and palate. design: retrospective cross-sectional investigation of infants born with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate using computed tomography scans acquired for investigation of a spectrum of clinical conditions. setting: computed tomography scan data were obtained from 29 unoperated cleft lip and palate infants and 12 noncleft infants of malay origin, ages 0 to 12 months. methods: observational study of cervical spine computed tomography scans. heights of cervical vertebral bodies (c2-c7) and intervertebral spaces were measured from landmarks identified from computed tomography reformats and three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions. linear modeling of heights and spaces, with age as a covariate, was undertaken to identify differences between the samples. results: anomalous features observed in the cleft lip and palate sample included short posterior arch of c1 (2/29), abnormal development of the anterior arch of c1 (2/29), and fusions of the posterior arch of c2 and c3 (2/29). no anomalies of the cervical spine were observed in the noncleft sample. although the heights of three cervical vertebral bodies were significantly smaller and two intervertebral spaces were significantly larger in infants with cleft lip and palate compared with noncleft infants (p < .05), overall length of the cervical spine did not differ significantly between the samples. conclusion: there was evidence for subtle upper spinal anomalies in the infant cleft lip and palate population. our finding of reduced size of some cervical vertebral bodies may reflect delayed upper spinal development in infants with cleft lip and palate.
backgroundin the 1990s, epidemiological studies estimated the prevalence of stroke caused by atrial fibrillation (af) at about 15 %. given the aging population, there is a rise in the number of af patients. af prevention guidelines based on clinical practice and the literature have been published and updated since 2001. implementation seems to have an impact on the prescription of vitamin k antagonist (vka). during the last 20 years, few population-based studies have focused on the prevalence of atrial arrhythmia (aa) in patients with stroke. the objective of the present prospective study, using data from 2008, was to evaluate the prevalence of aa (atrial fibrillation/flutter) in patients with stroke and the impact of implementing af guidelines.methodsthe prevalence of aa was studied in patients diagnosed with stroke from january 1 to december 31, 2008 in the population-based stroke registry of brest, france (total population, 363,760 according to the 2008 census, with 295,553 aged 15 years or older). guidelines implementation was assessed in terms of antithrombotic therapy (vka, antiplatelet agent, none), and the chads2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack).results851 cases of stroke were identified. the prevalence of aa was 31.7 % (n = 264), and increased with age from < 20 % in patients aged 45 to 54 years to nearly 50 % in patients ≥ 85 years. in patients with aa, 231 strokes were ischemic, 28 hemorrhagic and 5 undetermined. at time of stroke, aa was known in 207 patients (78.4 %). 54 of the 152 patients with chads2 score ≥ 2 (35.5 %) were treated with vka; this proportion decreased with age: 50 % between 50 and 74 years, 43.8 % between 75 and 84 years, and 25 % at 85 years and older.conclusionthe prevalence of aa in the population-based brest stroke registry in 2008 was higher than that reported by studies conducted 20 years ago. despite publication of af prevention guidelines, vka prescription and use in elderly patients were significantly low. background: prospective population-based studies are important to accurately determine the incidence and characteristics of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (af), while avoiding selection bias which may complicate hospital-based studies. methods: we investigated af-associated stroke within the north dublin population stroke study, a prospective cohort study of stroke/transient ischaemic attack in 294,592 individuals, according to recommended criteria for rigorous stroke epidemiological studies. results: of 568 stroke patients ascertained in the first year, 31.2% (177/568) were associated with af (90.4%, i.e. 160/177 ischaemic infarcts). the crude incidence rate of all af-associated stroke was 60/100,000 person-years (95% ci = 52–70). prior stroke was almost twice as common in af compared to non-af groups (21.9 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.01). the frequency of af progressively increased across ischaemic stroke patients stratified by increasing stroke severity (nihss 0–4, 29.7%; 5–9, 38.1%; 10–14, 43.8%; ≥15, 53.3%, p < 0.0001). the 90-day trajectory of recovery of af-associated stroke was identical to that of non-af stroke, but rankin scores in af stroke remained higher at 7, 28 and 90 days (p < 0.001 for all). discussion: af-associated stroke occurred in one third of all patients and was associated with a distinct profile of recurrent, severe and disabling stroke. targeted strategies to increase anticoagulation rates may provide a substantial benefit to prevent severe disabling stroke at a population level.
zusammenfassungziel unserer untersuchung war es, die prävalenz von osteopenie/osteoporose bei männlichen hiv/aids patienten zu erheben und den einfluss von antiretroviraler behandlung (art), hiv und anderen risikofaktoren auf die reduktion der knochenmineraldichte zu erfassen. alle bekannten slowenischen hiv-infizierten art-naiven und art-behandelten männer (länger als 12 monate infiziert bzw. behandelt) wurden eingeladen, an dieser horizontalen studie teilzunehmen. es wurden alter, bmi, taille-hüfte-quotient, familienanamnese bezüglich hüftfrakturen, dauer der infektion, dauer der art, nikotinund alkoholkonsum, körperliche aktivität, viruslast, und cd4+ zellen erhoben. die knochendichte wurde mittels dxa gemessen. insgesamt wurden 96 patienten erfasst (von 133, die die einschlusskriterien erfüllten). diese wurden in drei gruppen geteilt: gruppe a (n = 24): art-naiv; gruppe b1 (n = 37): mit mit art ohne proteaseinhibitor (pi) behandelt; gruppe b2 (n = 35): mit art mit pi behandelte patienten. die prävalenz der osteopenie/osteoporose lag bei 57 (59%), wobei 45 (47%) eine osteopenie und 12 (12%) eine osteoporose hatten. in der gruppe a wurde eine signifikant erniedrigte knochendichte beobachtet (p = 0,02). die multiple logistische regressionsanalyse zeigte, dass art ein unabhängig negativer prädiktor für eine reduzierte knochendichte war (p = 0,037; or = 0,29, 95% ci 0,09–0,93). vitamin-d3-mangel wurde in 79 (82%) der patienten entdeckt. die in dieser studie untersuchten patienten repräsentieren 72% aller männlichen mit hiv infizierten slowenischen patienten, dies ist der höchste bisher jemals publizierte anteil. die prävalenz einer reduzierten knochendichte war deutlich höher als bei nicht hiv-infizierten slowenischen männern der gleichen altersgruppe. es gab keine abhängigkeit der reduzierten knochendichte von jeglicher form von art. unsere ergebnisse zeigen, dass das fehlen einer art einen unabhängigen risikofaktor für osteopenie/osteoporose darstellt. gezieltes screening und frühe behandlung stellen unseres erachtens eine sinnvolle strategie zur vorbeugung einer reduzierten knochendichte bei hiv-infizierten männern dar. die korrektur von vitamin-d3-spiegeln könnte eine zusätzliche wichtige komponente darstellen.summarythe objective of our investigation was to estimate the prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis in men with hiv/aids and evaluate the role of antiretroviral treatment (art), hiv and other risk factors in reducing bone mineral density (bmd). all known slovenian hiv-infected art-naïve and treated males (infected or treated > 12 months) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. data were collected on age, bmi, waist-hip ratio, family history of hip fracture, duration of infection, duration of art, smoking, alcohol, exercise, viral load and cd4+ cells. bmd was measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry. a total of 96 patients (out of 133 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria) were assessed and allocated into three groups: group a (n = 24), art-naïve; group b1 (n = 37), treated with non-protease-inhibitor (pi) containing art; and group b2 (n = 35), treated with pi-containing art. the prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis was 57/96 (59%): osteopenia 45/96 (47%) and osteoporosis 12/96 (12%). significantly lower bmd was detected in group a (p = 0.020). multiple logistic regression analysis showed art to be an independent negative predictor for reduced bmd (p = 0.037; or = 0.29, 95%ci 0.09–0.93). vitamin d3 deficiency was detected in 79 (82%) of the patients. the study group represented 72% of the national hiv-infected male population; this proportion being higher than in any other study reported to date. the prevalence of reduced bmd was notably higher than the national prevalence among men of comparable age. there was no association between reduced bmd and any specific art. according to our results, absence of art was confirmed as an independent predictor of osteopenia/osteoporosis. targeted screening and early treatment present a reasonable strategy for preventing reduced bmd in hiv-infected patients, but correcting vitamin d3 levels could also be an important component. since the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy in combination regimens, multiple epidemiologic studies have shown that osteopenia and osteoporosis are common among patients with hiv infection. however, there remain many areas of uncertainty about this potential complication, which can be confusing for the hiv clinician. this review summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, suggested screening strategies, and management options of decreased bone mineral density in patients with hiv. our aims are to review the available data, highlight controversial issues, and provide guidance for clinicians where supporting data are unavailable.
despite intensive recommendations, influenza vaccination rate in medical staff in poland ranges from about 20 % in physicians to 10 % in nurses. the objective of this work was to assess the influence of hospital influenza vaccination campaign directed toward health care workers, combined with dispensing free of charge vaccine, on vaccination rate. the campaign was conducted by the hospital infection control team of the czerniakowski hospital in warsaw, poland, separately for physicians, nurses, and physiotherapists. overall, 37 % of medical staff were vaccinated, including 55 % of physicians and 21 % of nurses. concerning physicians, the greatest vaccination rate was in the orthopedic (80 %) and ophthalmology units (73 %), whereas the lowest rate was in the intensive care (22 %) and neurology units (20 %). concerning nurses, the greatest vaccination rate was in those working in the outpatient (40 %) and emergency units (29 %), whereas the lowest rate was in the ophthalmology (6 %) and surgery units (11 %). we conclude that the professional knowledge campaign combined with the incentive of free of charge vaccine substantially raises the vaccination rate among medical staff. backgroundannual influenza vaccination is recommended for healthcare workers (hcws) in order to reduce the morbidity associated with influenza in healthcare settings. the aim of this study was to evaluate the current vaccination status of the hcws in one of italy's largest multidisciplinary university hospitals.methodsbetween february 1 and march 31, 2006, we carried out a cross-sectional study of influenza vaccination coverage among hcws at the university hospital fondazione irccs "ospedale maggiore policlinico, mangiagalli e regina elena", milan, italy. after receiving a brief description of the aim of the study, 2,143 (95%: 1,064 physicians; 855 nurses; 224 paramedics) of 2,240 hcws self-completed an anonymous questionnaire.resultsinfluenza vaccination coverage was very low in all specialties, varying from 17.6% in the emergency department to 24.3% in the surgery department, and knowledge of influenza epidemiology and prevention was poor. the factors positively associated with being vaccinated were an age of ≥ 45 years, considering influenza a potentially severe disease, and being aware of the high-risk categories for which influenza vaccination is strongly recommended; those that negatively associated with being vaccinated were being female, working in the medicine department, and being a nurse or paramedic.conclusiondespite strong recommendations, influenza vaccination coverage seemed to be very low among hcws of all specialties, with differences between areas and types of employment. specific continuous educational and vaccination programs for different targets should be urgently organized to reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients, contain nosocomial outbreaks, and ensure an appropriate socioeconomic impact.
the ras/raf/erk1/2 signaling pathway plays an important role in central and peripheral neurons in functions such as dendritic arborization, neuronal polarity, and axon assembly. however, emerging evidence also shows that up-regulation of this signaling pathway may lead to the development of spinal cord injury. the present study aimed to determine the effects of ras/raf/erk1/2 signaling pathway inhibition on properties of spinal cord-injured neurons. first, neurons from spinal cord-injured c57bl/6 j mouse pups and sham-operated c57bl/6 j mouse pups were harvested. then, immunofluorescence, western blotting, cell adhesion and cell migration assays, and dii labeling were employed to investigate the effect of ras/raf/erk1/2 signaling pathway inhibition on spinal cord-injured neurons. immunofluorescence results of synapse formation indicated that the experimental spinal cord injury model was successfully established. western blot results identified upregulated erk phosphorylation in the spinal cord-injured neurons, and also showed that u0126 inhibited phosphorylation of erk, which is a downstream kinase in the ras/raf signaling pathway. additionally, cell migration and adhesion was significantly increased in the spinal cord-injured neurons. dii labeling results also showed an increased formation of mature spines after inhibition of ras/raf/erk1/2 signaling. taken together, these results suggested that the ras/raf/erk1/2 signaling pathway could serve as an effective treatment target for spinal cord injury. atheroma formation involves the movement of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmc) into the subendothelial space. the aim of this study was to determine the involvement of pi3k and mapk pathways and the importance of cross-talk between these pathways, in glucose-potentiated vsmc chemotaxis to serum factors. vsmc chemotaxis occurred in a serum gradient in 25 mmol/l glucose (but not in 5 mmol/l glucose) in association with increased phosphorylation (activation) of akt and erk1/2 in pi3k and mapk pathways, respectively. inhibitors of these pathways blocked chemotaxis, as did an mtor inhibitor. vsmc expressed all class ia pi3k isoforms, but microinjection experiments demonstrated that only the p110&bgr; isoform was involved in chemotaxis. erk1/2 phosphorylation was reduced not only by mapk pathway inhibitors but also by pi3k and mtor inhibitors; when pi3k was inhibited, erk phosphorylation could be induced by microinjected activated akt, indicating important cross-talk between the pi3k and erk1/2 pathways. glucose-potentiated phosphorylation of molecules in the p38 and jnk mapk pathways inhibited these pathways but did not affect chemotaxis. the statin, mevinolin, blocked chemotaxis through its effects on the mapk pathway. mevinolin-inhibited chemotaxis was restored by farnesylpyrophosphate but not by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate; in the absence of mevinolin, inhibition of farnesyltransferase reduced erk phosphorylation and blocked chemotaxis, indicating a role for the ras family of gtpases (mapk pathway) under these conditions. in conclusion, glucose sensitizes vsmc to serum, inducing chemotaxis via pathways involving p110&bgr;-pi3k, akt, mtor, and erk1/2 mapk. cross-talk between the pi3k and mapk pathways is necessary for vsmc chemotaxis under these conditions.
antidepressants affect memory and neural responses to emotionally valenced stimuli in healthy volunteers. however, it is unclear whether this extends to autobiographical memory for personally experienced events. the current study investigated the effects of acute administration of the antidepressant reboxetine on emotional autobiographical retrieval in healthy volunteers (14 men, 10 women). functional magnetic resonance imaging was used in a double-blind between-groups investigation with reboxetine (4 mg) and placebo. consistent with previous reports using lab-based stimuli, neural activation in the processing of positive versus negative memories was reduced following reboxetine compared with placebo in the left frontal lobe (extending into the insula) and the right superior temporal gyrus. this was paired with increased memory speed in volunteers given reboxetine versus placebo. the effect of reboxetine on emotional memory extends to recall of personally experienced events. such effects may be relevant to the cognitive improvements found with recovery from depression and with the mechanism of action of contemporary antidepressant drugs. autobiographical memory (am) entails a complex set of operations, including episodic memory, self-reflection, emotion, visual imagery, attention, executive functions, and semantic processes. the heterogeneous nature of am poses significant challenges in capturing its behavioral and neuroanatomical correlates. investigators have recently turned their attention to the functional neuroanatomy of am. we used the effect-location method of meta-analysis to analyze data from 24 functional imaging studies of am. the results indicated a core neural network of left-lateralized regions, including the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal, medial and lateral temporal and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortices, the temporoparietal junction and the cerebellum. secondary and tertiary regions, less frequently reported in imaging studies of am, are also identified. we examined the neural correlates of putative component processes in am, including, executive functions, self-reflection, episodic remembering and visuospatial processing. we also separately analyzed the effect of select variables on the am network across individual studies, including memory age, qualitative factors (personal significance, level of detail and vividness), semantic and emotional content, and the effect of reference conditions. we found that memory age effects on medial temporal lobe structures may be modulated by qualitative aspects of memory. studies using rest as a control task masked process-specific components of the am neural network. our findings support a neural distinction between episodic and semantic memory in am. finally, emotional events produced a shift in lateralization of the am network with activation observed in emotion-centered regions and deactivation (or lack of activation) observed in regions associated with cognitive processes.
neural stem cells (nscs), when stimulated with epidermal growth factor (egf) or fibroblast growth factor-2 (fgf-2), have the capacity to renew, expand, and produce precursors for neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. we postulated that the early appearance of insulin-like growth factor (igf-i) receptors during mouse striatum development implies a role in nsc regulation. thus, we testedin vitro the action of igf-i on the proliferation of striatal nscs. in the absence of igf-i, neither egf nor fgf-2 was able to induce the proliferation of e14 mouse striatal cells. however, addition of igf-i generated large proliferative clusters, termed spheres, in a dose-dependent manner. the newly generated spheres were multipotent, and clonal analysis revealed that egf or fgf-2, in the presence of igf-i, acted directly on nscs. the actions of igf-i suggest distinct modes of action of egf or fgf-2 on nscs. first, continuous versus delayed administration of these neurotrophic factors showed that neither igf-i nor egf had an effect on nsc survival, whereas fgf-2 promoted the survival or maintenance of the stem cell state of 50% of nscs for 6 d. second, short-term exposure to igf-i induced the proliferation of nscs in the presence of egf, but not of fgf-2, through an autocrine secretion of igf-i. these findings suggest that igf-i is a key factor in the regulation of nsc activation and that egf and fgf-2 control striatal nsc proliferation, in part, through distinct intracellular mechanisms. fibroblast growth factor stimulates proliferation and subsequent differentiation of precursor cells isolated from the neuroepithelium of embryonic day 10 mice in vitro. here we show that fibroblast growth factor-induced proliferation is dependent on the presence of insulin-like growth factors (igfs) and that igf-i is endogenously produced by the neuroepithelial cells. blocking of endogenous igf-i activity with anti-igf-i antibodies results in complete inhibition of fibroblast growth factor-mediated proliferation and in cell death. igf-i alone acts as a survival agent. these observations correlate with the detection of transcripts for igf-i and basic fibroblast growth factor in freshly isolated neuroepithelium and are consistent with an autocrine action of these factors in early brain development in vivo.
there is increasing evidence that physical activity (pa) can enhance weight loss and other outcomes after bariatric surgery. however, most preoperative patients are insufficiently active and, without support, fail to make substantial increases in their pa postoperatively. this review provides the rationale for pa counseling in bariatric surgery and describes how to appropriately tailor strategies to preoperative and postoperative patients. physical activity is a cornerstone in the medical management of obesity and could be important for weight loss following bariatric surgery. this review aims to describe the evolution of physical activity following massive weight loss induced by bariatric surgery, and to identify the relationship between physical activity and amount of weight loss. a literature search identified 20 publications (19 studies) reporting physical activity data in relation to bariatric surgery. all studies were observational. self‐assessment of physical activity was used in all the studies. objective measures (pedometry) were used in two studies. the time frame for physical activity assessment varied: before surgery in two publications, after surgery in nine, and longitudinal pre‐ to post‐operative evolution in nine. the latter nine publications found an increase in physical activity after bariatric surgery. in 10/13 studies where it was described, there was a positive relationship between physical activity level and amount of weight loss. in conclusion, observational evidence of self‐reported physical activity suggests that physical activity increases after bariatric surgery and that physical activity is associated with surgically induced weight loss. however, these findings warrant further evaluation using objective measures of physical activity and testing in controlled trials.
measurements of the activities of lysosomal enzymes in cerebrospinal fluid have recently been proposed as putative biomarkers for parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. to define the operating procedures useful for ensuring the reliability of these measurements, we analyzed several pre-analytical factors that may influence the activity of β-glucocerebrosidase, α-mannosidase, β-mannosidase, β-galactosidase, α-fucosidase, β-hexosaminidase, cathepsin d and cathepsin e in cerebrospinal fluid. lysosomal enzyme activities were measured by well-established fluorimetric assays in a consecutive series of patients (n = 28) with different neurological conditions, including parkinson's disease. the precision, pre-storage and storage conditions, and freeze/thaw cycles were evaluated. all of the assays showed within- and between-run variabilities below 10%. at −20°c, only cathepsin d was stable up to 40 weeks. at −80°c, the cathepsin d, cathepsin e, and β-mannosidase activities did not change significantly up to 40 weeks, while β-glucocerebrosidase activity was stable up to 32 weeks. the β-galactosidase and α-fucosidase activities significantly increased (+54.9±38.08% after 4 weeks and +88.94±36.19% after 16 weeks, respectively). up to four freeze/thaw cycles did not significantly affect the activities of cathepsins d and e. the β-glucocerebrosidase activity showed a slight decrease (−14.6%) after two freeze/thaw cycles. the measurement of lysosomal enzyme activities in cerebrospinal fluid is reliable and reproducible if pre-analytical factors are accurately taken into consideration. therefore, the analytical recommendations that ensue from this study may contribute to the establishment of actual values for the activities of cerebrospinal fluid lysosomal enzymes as putative biomarkers for parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. the optimal assay conditions and the stability of the following enzymes of lysosomal origin in human cerebrospinal fluid (csf) were studied: acid phosphatase, beta-d-n-acetylglucosaminidase, alpha-d-galactosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, alpha-d-glucosidase, beta-d-glucosidase, alpha-l-fucosidase, alpha-d-mannosidase, beta-d-glucuronidase. the microsomal alpha-d-mannosidase, ph 5.7, was used as a reference non-lysosomal glycohydrolase. all the examined enzymes, with the only exception of beta-d-glucuronidase, underwent a more or less rapid loss of activity upon csf storage in the temperature range from 37 degrees c to -80 degrees c. storage in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees c) was the only condition in which full activity for all tested enzymes was maintained for at least 15 days. addition of human serum albumin to csf, immediately after withdrawal, had a double effect in favouring enzyme stabilization and causing enzyme activation in some cases, and enzyme inhibition in others. using conditions warranting enzyme stability the fluorimetric methods for lysosomal enzymes determination in cerebrospinal fluid appear to be highly reproducible (cv less than 5%) and simple enough for routine use.
introduction concentrations of b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) are recognised as a reliable marker of ventricular dysfunction in adults. in this study, plasma levels of bnp were determined in children with congenital heart disease (chd) involving a left-to-right shunt, and were correlated with the shunt volume.   methods seventy-six children (38 boys/38 girls, mean age 22.4 months) with chd (group a: 31 with atrial septal defect [asd], 23 with ventricular septal defect [vsd], 8 with asd and vsd, 14 with patent ductus arteriosus [pda]) and 34 healthy children (group b) were studied. bnp was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in all children. the amount of shunt (the ratio of pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow: qp/qs) was measured using doppler velocimetry and two-dimensional echocardiography. a haemodynamically significant left-to-right shunt was defined as qp/qs>1.5. correlations were evaluated between all patient groups and healthy subjects and bnp was compared with echocardiographic data reflecting right and left ventricle volume overload.   results thirty-four children of group a had qp/qs>1.5 (group a1) and 42 qp/qs<1.5 (group a2). bnp levels were higher in group a1 than group a2 (p=0.015), while there were no significant differences in bnp between group a2 and group b (p=0.79). bnp 24.4 pg/ml was determined as the cut-off point to identify patients with qp/qs>1.5. bnp values were similar among patients with asd and vsd, but they were significantly higher in patients with pda. bnp was positively correlated with qp/qs (r=0.59, p<0.001), and with the pulmonary artery velocity (r=0.27) and gradient (r=0.49), while there was a negative correlation with ejection fraction (r=-0.14). bnp levels were significantly higher in 10 infants with clinical signs of heart failure (p=0.025).   conclusion these results, which are consistent with previous reports, suggest a possible role of bnp as an early diagnostic marker of the significance of shunt in children with chd. the goal of this study was to test the utility of bedside plasma concentration of b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) assay as a screen for large shunts in pediatric patients with atrial septal defects (asds) and ventricular septal defects (vsds). thirty-five children at a mean age of 70 ± 129 weeks with asd or vsd were included in the study. nine patients had vsd and 26 had asd. plasma bnp values were compared with the qp/qs ratios derived from quantitative doppler flow measurements. mean bnp was 29 ± 42 pg/ml, with a range between <5 pg/ml and 208 pg/ml. sixteen patients had qp/qs values >1.5 and 19 had values <1.5. the difference of mean bnp in these patient groups was statistically significant (45 ± 56 vs 14 ± 17, p = 0.03). bnp was positively correlated with shunt significance. receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 79% at a plasma bnp cut-off level of ≥20 pg/ml. bedside measurement of bnp correlates with magnitude of asd and vsd in children. bnp can provide information for the management of children with asd or vsd. it can be used as part of the evaluation of a child with a preliminary diagnosis of a congenital defect.
the widespread distribution of lentiviruses among african primates, and the lack of severe pathogenesis in many of these natural reservoirs, are taken as evidence for long-term co-evolution between the simian immunodeficiency viruses (sivs) and their primate hosts. evidence for positive selection acting on antiviral restriction factors is consistent with virus-host interactions spanning millions of years of primate evolution. however, many restriction mechanisms are not virus-specific, and selection cannot be unambiguously attributed to any one type of virus. we hypothesized that the restriction factor trim5, because of its unique specificity for retrovirus capsids, should accumulate adaptive changes in a virus-specific fashion, and therefore, that phylogenetic reconstruction of trim5 evolution in african primates should reveal selection by lentiviruses closely related to modern sivs. we analyzed complete trim5 coding sequences of 22 old world primates and identified a tightly-spaced cluster of branch-specific adaptions appearing in the cercopithecinae lineage after divergence from the colobinae around 16 million years ago. functional assays of both extant trim5 orthologs and reconstructed ancestral trim5 proteins revealed that this cluster of adaptations in trim5 specifically resulted in the ability to restrict cercopithecine lentiviruses, but had no effect (positive or negative) on restriction of other retroviruses, including lentiviruses of non-cercopithecine primates. the correlation between lineage-specific adaptations and ability to restrict viruses endemic to the same hosts supports the hypothesis that lentiviruses closely related to modern sivs were present in africa and infecting the ancestors of cercopithecine primates as far back as 16 million years ago, and provides insight into the evolution of trim5 specificity. after entry into target cells, retroviruses encounter the host restriction factors such as fv1 and trim5α. while it is clear that these factors target retrovirus capsid proteins (ca), recognition remains poorly defined in the absence of structural information. to better understand the binding interaction between trim5α and ca, we selected a panel of novel n-tropic murine leukaemia virus (n-mlv) escape mutants by a serial passage of replication competent n-mlv in rhesus macaque trim5α (rhtrim5α)-positive cells using a small percentage of unrestricted cells to allow multiple rounds of virus replication. the newly identified mutations, many of which involve changes in charge, are distributed over the outer ‘top’ surface of n-mlv ca, including the n-terminal β-hairpin, and map up to 29 ao apart. biological characterisation with a number of restriction factors revealed that only one of the new mutations affects restriction by human trim5α, indicating significant differences in the binding interaction between n-mlv and the two trim5αs, whereas three of the mutations result in dual sensitivity to fv1n and fv1b. structural studies of two mutants show that no major changes in the overall ca conformation are associated with escape from restriction. we conclude that interactions involving much, if not all, of the surface of ca are vital for trim5α binding.
materials and methods: this descriptive, analytic, cross-sectional, and hospital-based study was conducted in khartoum state, sudan; it was carried out from march 2013 to may 2014.the subjects enrolled for the study included 200 women with pcos who were compared with 100 healthy women of the control group; all of them were age and weight matched. samples were taken after overnight fasting, and then serum lipid levels were analyzed using enzymatic colorimetric methods. data management and analysis were done by using microsoft excel and spss software, version 20.00. twenty-nine patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) and 30 normal women had lipoprotein lipid and androgen profiles compared after a 12-h fast. both pcos and normal women were evaluated in the proliferative phase of the cycle. pcos patients had higher serum lh to fsh ratios [2.0 +/- 1.3 (+/- sem) vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1), higher testosterone (t; 66 +/- 5 vs. 33 +/- 2 ng/ml), higher free t (1.1 +/- 1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.02 ng/dl), and higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (291 +/- 28 vs. 140 +/- 12 micrograms/dl) levels, and lower t-estrogen-binding globulin-binding capacity (1.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.1 micrograms/dl) than normal women (all p less than 0.05). the pcos patients had higher mean serum triglycerides [122 +/- 11 (+/- sem) 63 +/- 3 mg/dl] and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (24 +/- 2 vs. 13 +/- 1 mg/dl), but lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (43 +/- 2 vs. 58 +/- 2 mg/dl; p less than 0.05). while pcos patients were heavier and more sedentary and their diets were higher in saturated fat and lower in fiber (p less than 0.01, respectively), the differences in lipoprotein lipid concentrations could not be attributed to body weight. t-estrogen-binding globulin-binding capacity correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol in pcos patients (r = 0.42; p = 0.025) after adjusting for weight. we conclude that hyperandrogenemia in women may result in a male pattern of lipoprotein lipid concentrations. these findings suggest that pcos patients may have increased atherogenic potential.
transgenic radiata pine (pinus radiata d. don) plants containing a bacillus thuringiensis (bt) toxin gene, crylac, were produced by means of biolistic transformation of embryogenic tissue. using the selectable marker gene nptii and corresponding geneticin selection, 20 independent transgenic lines from five genotypes were established. over 200 plants regenerated from ten transgenic lines were successfully transferred to soil. the integration and expression of the introduced genes in transgenic tissue and/or plants were confirmed by pcr, southern hybridisation and neomycin phosphotransferase ii (nptii) and bt elisa assays. bioassays with larvae of the painted apple moth, teia anartoides, demonstrated that transgenic plants displayed variable levels of resistance to insect damage, with one transgenic line being highly resistant to feeding damage. abstract. a biolistic transformation procedure was applied to co-transform embryogenic tissue of pinus radiata and picea abies with two plasmid dnas. the first vector contained the bar gene, specifying resistance to the herbicide glufosinate, under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. this plasmid also contained the pinus radiata germin cdna sequence, in either sense or antisense orientation, driven by the ubiquitin promoter. the second vector contained both the nptii gene under control of the camv 35s promoter for selection of transgenic tissue on geneticin and the uida reporter gene under control of the double camv 35 promoter. polymerase chain reaction analysis of selected geneticin-resistant tissue showed that the transformation rates for the co-bombarded plasmid were high in both pinus radiata (75%) and picea abies (86%). a combination of phenotypic analysis and northern hybridisation demonstrated that a number of the transgenic lines expressed all four transgenes. regenerated plantlets from pinus radiata and picea abies transgenic lines were spray-tested with commercial rates of buster (glufosinate at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kg active ingredient per hectare). transgenic plants survived and continued to grow with minor or no damage to their needles, whereas non-transgenic plants regenerated from the same cell lines died within 8 weeks of spraying. to our knowledge, this is the first report on genetically engineered herbicide resistance in conifers, and the results demonstrate that this trait is a feasible option for plantation forestry.
aim prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the western male population. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and tissue inhibitors of mmps (timps) modulate the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ecm). the imbalance between mmps and timps may lead to an emergence of pathological processes such as cancer. in this study, the association between timp-2 (-418 g/c) and mmp-2 (-1306 c/t) polymorphisms and prostate cancer in the turkish population was investigated.   materials and methods sixty-one prostate cancer patients and 46 healthy subjects were included in the study. dna was isolated from 2 ml of peripheral blood taken from subjects, and genotypes were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.   results the timp-2 -418 (gc) genotype was found in 15 cases (32.6%) in the control group and in 9 cases (14.8%) in the patients group, and statistical significance was determined (p = 0.037, or = 0.346). the mmp-2 -1306 (ct) genotype was found 2.17 times more in the patient group than in the control group (p = 0.149, or = 2.17).   conclusion our results show that the timp-2 -418 (gc) genotype had a putative protective effect against prostate cancer. background and aims the importance of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and their tissue inhibitors (timps) in tumor progression is well documented. mmp2/timp2 system has a significant impact on the development and progression of cancer and genetic polymorphisms in the promoters of mmp2 (-1306c/t, 735c/t) and timp2 (-418g/a, -303c/t) are correlated with decreased enzyme activity. we sought to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in mmp2 and timp2 polymorphisms may be associated with varying risk of prostate cancer (pca) in men in north india.   methods genotyping was done by pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 190 histologically confirmed pca patients and 200 unrelated, healthy, age-matched individuals of similar ethnicity.   results patients with mmp2 (-1306) ct genotype as well as t allele were at higher risk of pca (p = 0.018; or = 1.68 and p = 0.015; or = 1.52). this effect was even more evident in the case of the t allele carrier (ct + tt) (p = 0.011; or = 1.71). mmp2 (735) c>t, timp2 (-418) g>c and timp2 (-303) c>t polymorphism demonstrated no association. however, timp2 (-418) gc was found to be involved in progression of pca but not in initiation. haplotype results demonstrated that mmp2 (1306t-735c) and timp2 (418g-303t) were associated with a 1.5- and 1.8-fold increased risk, respectively.   conclusions our data indicated that mmp2-1306c>t gene polymorphism contributes to pca susceptibility. these findings suggested mmp2 variants as a predictor of pca progression risk among north indian men. we assume that analysis of these gene polymorphisms can help identify patient subgroups at high risk of poor disease outcome.
objective to evaluate the correlation of total lymphocyte count (tlc) and cd4 cell count and the suitability of tlc as a surrogate marker for cd4 cell count of hiv-infected patients in china. methods usefulness of tlc as a surrogate marker for a cd4 cell count <350 cells/mm3 for hiv-positive patients in china was evaluated by 977 pairs of tlc and cd4 cell count from 977 outpatients. the result was then validated by a literature review which was conducted on 9 relevant articles. further investigation using the 977 pairs of tlc and cd4 cell count data was done to determine a tlc threshold for predicting a cd4 cell count <500 cells/mm3. correlation and receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis were performed for both cd4 cell counts, and the sensitivity and specificity were computed. results good correlation was noted between tlc and cd4 count (r = 0.60, 95% ci, 0.56–0.64). tlc obtained a relatively high diagnostic performance (area under roc curve, 0.80) for predicting a cd4 cell count <350 cells/mm3, with a sensitivity of 0.65 (95% ci, 0.61–0.68) and a specificity of 0.80 (95% ci, 0.75–0.85) at the tlc threshold of 1570 cells/mm3. the literature review suggested that for a cd4 cell count <350 cells/mm3, the optimal tlc threshold was 1500 cells/mm3, which was similar to the figure presented in this observational study. as for predicting a cd4 cell count <500 cells/mm3, tlc obtained a high diagnostic performance (area under roc curve, 0.82) as well with a sensitivity of 0.70 (95% ci, 0.67–0.73) and a specificity of 0.80 (95% ci, 0.73–0.87). conclusions when considering the antiretroviral therapy for hiv-infected chinese individuals, total lymphocyte count can be considered as an inexpensive and easily available surrogate marker for predicting two clinically important thresholds of cd4 count of 350 cells/mm3 and 500 cells/mm3. objectives  total lymphocyte counts (tlc) may be used as an alternative for cd4 cell counts to monitor hiv infection in resource‐limited settings, where cd4 cell counts are too expensive or not available.
the interaction between calcium (ca) and non-phytate phosphorus (npp) in broiler nutrition and skeletal health is highly complex with many factors influencing their digestion, absorption and utilisation. the use of an investigative model such as the geometric framework allows a graphical approach to explore these complex interactions. a total of 600 ross 308-day-old male broiler chicks were allocated to one of 15 dietary treatments with five replicates and eight birds per replicate. dietary treatments were formulated to one of three total densities of total ca+npp; high (15 g/kg), medium (13.5 g/kg) and low (12 g/kg) and at each density there were five different ratios of ca : npp (4, 2.75, 2.1, 1.5 and 1.14 : 1). weekly performance data was collected and at the end of the experiment birds were individually weighed and the right leg removed for tibia ash analysis. skeletal health was assessed using the latency to lie (ltl) at day 27. at low ca and high npp as well as high ca and low npp diets, birds had reduced feed intake, bw gain, poorer feed efficiency and lower tibia ash, resulting in a significant interaction between dietary ca and npp (p<0.05). ltl times were negatively influenced by diets having either a broad ratio (high ca, low npp) or too narrow a ratio (low ca, high npp) indicating that shorter ltl times may be influenced by the ratio of ca : npp rather than absolute concentrations of either mineral. the calculated intake arrays show that broilers more closely regulate ca intake than npp intake. broilers are willing to over consume npp to defend a ca intake target more so than they are willing to over consume ca to defend an npp target. overall dietary npp was more influential on performance metrics, however, from the data it may appear that birds prioritise ca intake over npp and broadly ate to meet this requirement. as broilers are more willing to eat to a ca intake target rather than an npp intake target, this emphasises the importance of formulating diets to a accurately balanced density of ca : npp considering the biological importance of both minerals. two experiments were conducted to determine the nonphytin phosphorus (npp) requirement for broilers, based on broken line analysis, in the finisher (32 to 42 d) and withdrawal phases (42 to 49 d) of a four-phase feeding program. the determined npp concentrations used were 0.15, 0.19, 0.26, and 0.31% in the finisher phase, experiment 1 (exp 1), and 0.10, 0.13, 0.22, and 0.27% in the withdrawal phase, experiment 2 (exp 2). the analyzed calcium levels in the diets were 0.69 +/- 0.02% and 0.72 +/- 0.05% in exp 1 and 2, respectively. in exp 2, an additional treatment was included in which birds were fed nrc-recommended (1994) npp levels from hatch to 49 d. there were no differences (p>0.05) among dietary treatments in weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency in either experiment. in exp 1, tibia ash weight of birds fed the diets containing 0.15% npp was lower (p<0.05) than that of birds fed diets containing 0.19, 0.26, or 0.31% npp. a requirement of 0.20 +/- 0.01% npp was determined for male broilers weighing between 1,541 to 2,194 g and from 32 to 42 d of age based on broken line analysis of tibia ash weight response to different dietary npp levels. in exp 2, the npp requirement of male broilers weighing between 2,396 g at 42 d and 3,076 g at 49 d, based on tibia ash weight, was 0.16 +/- 0.02% npp.
purposeto present pre-papillary vitreous opacity as an uncommon manifestation of inflammation in behçet’s disease that may be specific to this uveitic entity.methodswe retrospectively reviewed the charts of 67 patients with behçet’s disease examined at our clinic between 2005 and 2016. behçet’s disease was diagnosed based on established clinical criteria of inflammation involving the eyes, mucocutaneous junctions, and skin. patients with behçet’s disease who presented with papillitis and a pre-papillary vitreous opacity were identified. response to anti-inflammatory treatment on examination and optical coherence tomography imaging were evaluated. pubmed searches were performed for (1) other cases with pre-papillary vitreous opacities in uveitic entities and (2) reports of optic nerve involvement specifically in behçet’s disease.resultswe identified three patients with behçet’s disease who presented with unilateral papillitis and a pre-papillary vitreous opacity. the pre-papillary vitreous opacity had a funnel-shaped appearance on optical coherence tomography. all patients were initially treated with steroids, which led to resolution of the opacity clinically and on imaging. we identified one previous report of such a pre-papillary opacity in a patient with behçet’s disease, and no reports of this finding in other uveitic entities.conclusionthis study expands the number of behçet’s disease cases presenting with a pre-papillary vitreous opacity and demonstrates novel optical coherence imaging of this finding. this finding may be specific to behçet’s disease as it was not identified in other uveitic entities in a review of the existing literature. background to report the ocular manifestations of neuro-behcet's disease.   cases a 34-year-old woman had recurrent meningitis. she developed diplopia, headache, and ataxia, and was diagnosed as having neuro-behcet's disease.   observations imaging revealed two infarct foci in the transitional midbrain and pons. after treatment with prednisolone and colchicine, the diplopia resolved. two years later, a scotoma developed in the right eye, in which the best-corrected visual acuity was 4/200. papillitis and a prepapillary vitreous opacity were seen in the right fundus. these findings disappeared 11 days after subconjunctival steroid injections and increased colchicine. her vision gradually improved to 20/20 two months later.   conclusion neuro-behcet's disease may manifest with transient optic neuritis and prepapillary vitreous opacity.
clinical evidence indicates that fat is inversely proportional to bone mass in elderly obese women. however, it remains unclear whether obesity accelerates bone loss. in this report we present evidence that increased visceral fat leads to inflammation and subsequent bone loss in 12-month-old c57bl/6j mice that were fed 10% corn oil (co)-based diet and a control lab chow (lc) for 6 months. as expected from our previous work, co-fed mice demonstrated increased visceral fat and enhanced total body fat mass compared to lc. the adipocyte-specific pparγ and bone marrow (bm) adiposity were increased in co-fed mice. in correlation with those modifications, inflammatory cytokines (il-1β, il-6, tnf-α) were significantly elevated in co-fed mice compared to lc-fed mice. this inflammatory bm microenvironment resulted in increased superoxide production in osteoclasts and undifferentiated bm cells. in co-fed mice, the increased number of osteoclasts per trabecular bone length and the increased osteoclastogenesis assessed ex-vivo suggest that co diet induces bone resorption. additionally, the up-regulation of osteoclast-specific cathepsin k and rankl expression and down-regulation of osteoblast-specific runx2/cbfa1 supports this bone resorption in co-fed mice. also, co-fed mice exhibited lower trabecular bone volume in the distal femoral metaphysis and had reduced opg expression. collectively, our results suggest that increased bone resorption in mice fed a co-enriched diet is possibly due to increased inflammation mediated by the accumulation of adipocytes in the bm microenvironment. this inflammation may consequently increase osteoclastogenesis, while reducing osteoblast development in co-fed mice. body mass has a positive effect on bone health. whether mass derived from an obesity condition or excessive fat accumulation is beneficial to bone has not been established; neither have the mechanisms by which obesity affects bone metabolism. the aim of this study was to examine the effects of obesity on bone structure and osteoblastic expression of key markers involved in bone formation and resorption in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. six-wk-old male c57bl/6 mice (n=21) were assigned to two groups and fed either a control (10 kcal% energy as fat) or high-fat diet (hfd, 45 kcal% energy as fat) for 14 weeks. bone marrow stromal/osteoblastic cells (bmsc) were cultured. osteoprogenitor activity [alkaline phosphatase (alp) positive colonies] and mineralization (calcium nodule formation) were determined. gene expression was measured using quantitative real-time pcr. bone structure of proximal and midshaft tibia was evaluated by micro-computed tomography. mice fed the hfd were 31% heavier (p<0.01) than those fed the control diet. there were more alp positive colony forming units at d 14 and calcium nodules at d 28 of culture by bmsc from hfd mice than from control mice (p<0.01). receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand (rankl) mrna levels and the ratio of rankl to osteoprotegerin expression in hfd animals was higher (p<0.01) than in control diet animals. serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase levels were higher in hfd fed mice when compared to control diet fed mice (p<0.05). there were no significant differences in tibial fat-free weight, length, and cortical parameters of midshaft between the two groups. compared with control mice, tibial trabecular bone volume was reduced, and trabecular separation was increased in hfd mice. trabecular number was lower (p<0.05) and connectivity density tended to be less (p=0.07) in hfd mice than in control mice. in conclusion, our data indicate that obesity induced by a high-fat diet decreases cancellous bone mass but has no effect on cortical bone mass in the tibia in mice.
the majority of studies examining associations between clinical–diagnostic and empirical-quantitative approaches have concentrated only on the target diagnosis without taking into account any possible co-variation of psychopathological traits, which is intrinsic to child psychopathology. the ability of child behaviour checklist (cbcl) dsm-oriented scales (doss) to predict target and other dsm diagnoses, taking into consideration the covariation of psychopathological traits, was analysed by logistic regression analysis. corresponding odds ratio (or) was used as indicator of the strength of the relationship between the clinical score in doss and the presence of dsm-iv diagnoses. logistic regression allowed us to consider multiple scales simultaneously, thus addressing the problem of co-occurrence of psychopathological traits, and to include gender and age as covariates. the sample consisted of 360 children and adolescents aged 6–16 years, consecutively referred for behavioural and emotional problems. as a whole, the cbcl doss seem to be more specific but with a weaker association with dsm-iv diagnoses than syndrome scales, and with some distinctive features: clinical scores in the anxiety dos suggest a diagnosis of both anxiety and mood disorder; clinical scores in the somatic problems dos are very strong and specific predictors for diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder; clinical scores in the oppositional defiant problems dos are not only predictors of the oppositional defiant disorder but are also strong predictors of generalized anxiety disorder; clinical scores in the conduct problems dos are a specific and strong predictor for oppositional defiant disorder. results confirm the clinical usefulness of cbcl and suggest using both syndrome and dos scales for a complete and accurate assessment of children and adolescents. department of psychology, bryn mawr college separately for ages 11/2 to 5 and 6 to 18, used items for rating behavioral and emotional problems to construct (a) "top-down" dsm-oriented scales from experts' ratings of the items' consistency with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed. [dsm-iv], american psychiatric association, 1994) categories, and (b) "bottom-up" empirically based syndromes from factor analyses of parent, caregiver, teacher, and self ratings (n = 14,853). both kinds of scales are scored from the same assessment instruments and are displayed on profiles normed on the same national samples. psychometric properties were similar for both kinds of scales. associations between counterpart scales were medium to strong. quantified, normed dsm-oriented and empirically based scales scored from the same instruments can facilitate assessment of individuals, statistical analyses for research purposes, and integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to deriving constructs for psychopathology.
aimsthe variability patterns of fern root characteristics have seldom been studied. here we explored variability in root morphology, histology and chemistry among fern species of temperate forest, and compared the observed patterns with those of seed plants.methodswe sampled nine herbaceous fern species from temperate forest in northeastern china, and measured root morphological, histological and chemical characteristics across branch orders for each species.resultsall nine fern species had 3 or 4 root orders. with increasing root order, diameter, tissue density, cortical thickness and vascular cylinder diameter increased, while specific root length (srl) and tissue nitrogen concentration decreased. these were similar to the variability patterns that have been reported for seed plants, except for cortex. like seed plants, nine fern species showed close relationships among root morphological, histological and chemical characteristics in first-order roots, such as diameter and cortex, tissue density and nitrogen concentration, suggesting that the general linkage between root structure and function exists in all vascular plants.conclusionsthe observed variation within fern root systems is comparable to the reported variation in seed plants, indicating that the same functional constraints control the evolution and development of root systems in vascular plants belonging either to the fern or seed plant lineages. ephemeral roots have essential roles in plant and ecosystem functioning. in forests, roots account for a major component of carbon cycling, yet few studies have examined ranges of root trait variation and how different species vary in root form and function in these communities. root branching intensity, specific root length (srl; root length per unit dry mass), root diameter, tissue density, phenolic concentration and nitrogen concentration were determined for the finest two root orders of 25 co-existing north american woody species sampled from mature plants in a single forest community. trait correlations and multivariate patterns were examined to evaluate the most important trait differences among species. branching intensity, srl, and phenolic concentration varied most widely among species (coefficient of variation (cv) = 0.42, 0.57 and 0.58, respectively). species predominately forming ectomycorrhiza (em) had a higher branching intensity than those forming arbuscular mycorrhiza (am) with mycorrhizal types correctly predicted in c. 70% of individual observations by branching intensity alone. there was notably no correlation between srl and nitrogen. variation in srl among species mapped partially along phylogenetic lines (consistency index (ci) = 0.44), with remaining variation attributable to differences in species' ecological specialization. variation found in root traits suggests different nutrient acquisition strategies within this community, which could have potential species-level effects on carbon and mineral nutrient cycling.
abstract(−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg), the most abundant and active polyphenol in green tea, has been demonstrated to have anticancer effects in a wide variety of human cancer. micrornas (mirnas) are a class of short noncoding rnas and play important role in gene regulation and are critically involved in the pathogenesis and progression of human cancer. this study aims to investigate the effects of egcg on osteosarcoma (os) cells and elucidate the underlying mechanism. cellular function assays revealed that egcg inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis of os cells in vitro, and also inhibited the growth of transplanted tumors in vivo. by mirna microarray and rt-qpcr analysis, mir-1 was found to be significantly upregulated in mg-63 and u-2os treated by egcg in dose- and time-dependent manners, and mir-1 downregulation by inhibitor mimics attenuated egcg-induced inhibition on cell growth of os cells. we also confirmed that mir-1 was also frequently decreased in clinical os tumor tissues. moreover, both egcg and mir-1 mimic inhibited c-met expression, and combination treatment with egcg and c-met inhibitor (crizotinib) had enhanced inhibitory effects on the growth of mg-63 and u-2os cells. taken together, these results suggest that egcg has an anticancer effect on os cells, at least partially, through regulating mir-1/c-met interaction. previous studies indicate that green tea extract may inhibit breast cancer progression by blocking angiogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms are not well defined. epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg) is the major biologically active component of green tea. in this study we evaluated the cell proliferation and relative gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) expression on hs578t human breast cancer cell line at 24, 48 and 72 hours after 10 microm of egcg treatment. also, we evaluated the effect of this natural compound on the cell migratory behaviour based on real-time xcelligence data. cell proliferation becomes significantly low at 72 hours. egcg had a dual effect on the vegf gene expression timeline: after a first increase at 24 hours, it started to decrease at 48 and 72 hours. the inhibition of cell proliferation at 72 hours suggests a possible reactivation of apoptosis. the dual effect on vegf expression in the presence of egcg suggests the complexity of the angiogenic switch leading to the modulation of the cell migration processes. it also emphasizes the importance of the metabolite products in the modulation of these effects. our findings have shown that egcg suppresses the growth, migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells by inhibiting vegf expression. a better understanding of this mechanism may lead to an improved strategy for tumor therapy based on the inhibition of angiogenesis.
the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of lansoprazole (lpz) on lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) signal transduction systems using the 293htlr4/md2-cd14 cells. the cells were incubated and then divided into the following groups: (a) untreated group, (b) non-lpz treated (1h) group, (c) lpz-treated (1h) plus non lps-stimulated (1h) group, (d) lpz-treated (1h) plus non lps-stimulated (6h) group, (e) lpz-treated (1h) plus lps-stimulated (1h) group, (f) lpz-treated (1h) plus lps-stimulated (6h) group, (g) non lpz-treated (1h) plus lps-stimulated (1h) group and (h) non lpz-treated (1h) plus lps-stimulated (6h) group. samples from each group were subjected to western blotting for analysis of ikb phosphorylation, intranuclear transfer of nf-kb, phosphorylation of map kinase (mapk), intranuclear transfer of interferon regulatory factor 5 (irf5), and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (socs1). in the lpz-treated groups, neither phosphorylation of mapk nor intranuclear transfer of irf5 was suppressed under stimulation with lps, and enhanced intranuclear transfer of nf-kb and increased expression of socs1 were noted by comparison with the group treated with lps alone. these results suggest that lpz stimulates the expression of socs1 and regulates protein phosphorylation through its activity on tlr4 signal transduction under lps stimulation. exacerbation of disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is associated with bacterial infection. in conventional dendritic cells (cdcs), the tlr4 ligand bacterial lps induces ifn-β gene expression but does not induce ifn-α. we hypothesized that when cdcs are primed by cytokines, as may frequently be the case in sle, lps would then induce the production of ifn-α, a cytokine believed to be important in lupus pathogenesis. in this study we show that mouse cdcs and human monocytes produce abundant ifn-α following tlr4 engagement whether the cells have been pretreated either with ifn-β or with a supernatant from dcs activated by rna-containing immune complexes from lupus patients. this tlr4-induced ifn-α induction is mediated by both an initial trif-dependent pathway and a subsequent myd88-dependent pathway, in contrast to tlr3-induced ifn-α production, which is entirely trif-dependent. there is also a distinct requirement for ifn regulatory factors (irfs), with lps-induced ifn-α induction being entirely irf7- and partially irf5-dependent, in contrast to lps -induced ifn-β gene induction which is known to be irf3-dependent but largely irf7-independent. this data demonstrates a novel pathway for ifn-α production by cdcs and provides one possible explanation for how bacterial infection might precipitate disease flares in sle.
the antibody response plays a crucial role against hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, and our understanding of this intricate progress in vivo is far from complete. we previously reported a novel and robust technique based on a large combinatorial viral antigen library displayed on the surface of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, allowing comprehensive profiling of polyclonal antibody responses in vivo in both qualitative and quantitative terms. here, we report the generation and application of a combinatorial library of hcv strain jfh1 envelope glycoprotein to profile the antibody response in four hcv chronically infected individuals. by systematic analysis of the location and frequency of antigenic fragments along the jfh1 envelope glycoprotein, we showed that the major binding antibody response was targeted to e2 (80.9-99.8 %), whilst that against e1 was relatively small (0.3-19.0 %). a total of five major antigenic domains (d1-d5) were identified: one was within e1 and an additional four within e2, despite substantial variability among the different individuals. however, serum absorption with the yeast clones containing the antigenic domain d1 resulted in more reduction in neutralizing antibody activity against pseudotyped hcv than those in e2, suggesting that e1 contains additional neutralizing epitopes. our results have provided additional insights into the hcv-specific antibody response in humans and should assist in a better understanding of protective antibody immunity and in guiding the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against hcv infection. to determine whether there was a correlation between the kinetics or frequency of antibody to mammalian-derived hepatitis c virus (hcv) second envelope protein (e2) and development of chronicity or self-limitation of hcv infections, serial sera were examined for anti-e2, anti-hcv with confirmation with matrix 2.0 (abbott laboratories, abbott park, il), and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) from 6 cases of self-limited infection and 6 cases of chronic infection in chimpanzees, and from 5 cases of self-limited infection and 3 cases of chronic infection in patients. anti-e2 developed earlier, more frequently, and to higher titer in chimpanzees and patients who were developing chronic infection than in those with self-limited infections. thus anti-e2 is unlikely to play a role in self-limitation of the infection. however, long-term persistence of anti-e2 correlates with chronic infection. there was little or no correlation between the timing of development of anti-e2 and anti-hcv.
bottom-up processes can interrupt ongoing cognitive processing in order to adaptively respond to emotional stimuli of high potential significance, such as those that threaten wellbeing. however it is vital that this interference can be modulated in certain contexts to focus on current tasks. deficits in the ability to maintain the appropriate balance between cognitive and emotional demands can severely impact on day-to-day activities. this fmri study examined this interaction between threat processing and cognition; 18 adult participants performed a visuospatial working memory (wm) task with two load conditions, in the presence and absence of anxiety induction by threat of electric shock. threat of shock interfered with performance in the low cognitive load condition; however interference was eradicated under high load, consistent with engagement of emotion regulation mechanisms. under low load the amygdala showed significant activation to threat of shock that was modulated by high cognitive load. a directed top-down control contrast identified two regions associated with top-down control; ventrolateral pfc and dorsal acc. dynamic causal modeling provided further evidence that under high cognitive load, top-down inhibition is exerted on the amygdala and its outputs to prefrontal regions. additionally, we hypothesized that individual differences in a separate, non-emotional top-down control task would predict the recruitment of dorsal acc and ventrolateral pfc during top-down control of threat. consistent with this, performance on a separate dichotic listening task predicted dorsal acc and ventrolateral pfc activation during high wm load under threat of shock, though activation in these regions did not directly correlate with wm performance. together, the findings suggest that under high cognitive load and threat, top-down control is exerted by dacc and vlpfc to inhibit threat processing, thus enabling wm performance without threat-related interference. the human pupillary response, whose final neural pathways are mediated through the autonomic nervous system, has been shown to reflect more centrally occurring processes when examined from the perspective of information processing activities. this paper will examine components of information processing as reflected in the pupillary response, and its relation to other neurophysiological signs of cognitive activity, most notably, event-related brain potentials. both the constriction of the pupil to light (miosis), as well as the dilation (dilatation; mydriasis) resulting from information delivery, have provided useful adjuncts in the study of psychopathology, especially with reference to schizophrenia. the time course of pupillary dilation, reflected in the morphology of the pupillographic record, indicates a high degree of similarity among related family members. findings from psychiatric patients and their relatives will be reviewed. while the contributions of separate physiological components to the pupillary dilation response that relate to cognitive activity have never been adequately delineated, a review of findings indicates the possibility for experimental dissection of components. a model delineating likely psychophysiological contributions to the pupillary response, and approaches for testing the model, will be presented.
this study was designed to test the hypothesis that the cellular metabolism of ca2+ and mg2+, which is important in platelet function, is abnormal in the platelets of patients with vasospastic angina. cytosolic free mg2+ concentration ([mg2+]i) and ca2+ handling were determined in the platelets of 24 patients with vasospastic angina and 24 control subjects by use of mag-fura 2 and fura 2. platelet aggregation was also examined. basal [mg2+]iand cytosolic free ca2+concentration ([ca2+]i) in platelets were significantly higher in patients with vasospastic angina than in control subjects. the amplitude of the [ca2+]itransient induced by thrombin (0.03-1.0 u/ml) was significantly increased in the presence, but not in the absence, of extracellular ca2+ in patients with vasospastic angina, as compared with controls. therefore, the influx of ca2+ across the plasma membrane may be accelerated in vasospastic angina. thrombin (0.1-1.0 u/ml)-induced maximum aggregation response was significantly greater in patients with vasospastic angina than in controls. results suggest that increased [mg2+]iand altered ca2+ handling by platelets may be associated with coronary vasospasm. there is controversy as to whether platelet intracellular free calcium ([ca2+]i) is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) as compared with wistar-kyoto (wky) rats. discrepant results may be due to methodological problems including platelet activation during the collection process and leakage of intracellular dye used for [ca2+]i measurement. to provide further insight into this problem, [ca2+]i was estimated in fura-2-loaded platelets isolated from eight shr and seven wky rats at 12-14 weeks of age by using a two-syringe blood collection method and a correction method for fura-2 leakage. basal [ca2+]i was higher in shr than in wky rats (61.6 +/- 5.6 vs. 54.0 +/- 3.9 nm, p less than 0.02). however, the difference disappeared when a correction for fura-2 leakage was not used (109.7 +/- 18.4 vs. 94.9 +/- 9.2 nm, p less than 0.1). thus, differences in [ca2+]i between shr and wky rats may be obscured if dye leakage from platelets is not taken into account. thrombin (0.1 units/ml) induced a rise in [ca2+]i that was greater in shr than wky rats, both in the presence (491.4 +/- 31.6 vs. 377.5 +/- 21.7 nm, p less than 0.002) and absence (264.9 +/- 33.6 vs. 228.2 +/- 30.1 nm, p less than 0.05) of calcium in the media. these results indicate that thrombin-stimulated calcium influx as well as discharge of calcium from intracellular stores is increased in shr platelets. thus, under both basal and stimulated conditions, platelet calcium handling is abnormal in the shr.

macrophages are one of the most diverse cell populations in terms of their anatomical location and functional specialization during both homeostasis and disease. although it has been shown in different fate mapping models that some macrophages present in adult tissues are already established during fetal development, their exact origins are still under debate. in the current study, we developed a fate mapping strain, based on the kit locus, which allowed us to readdress "the origins" question. different types of macrophages from various adult tissues were traced to their fetal or adult sources by inducing labeling in precursors at several time points either during fetal development or in adult mice. we show that all adult macrophages, resident or infiltrating, are progenies of classical hematopoietic stem cells (hsc) with the exception of microglia and, partially epidermal langerhans cells, which are yolk sac (ys)-derived. blood monocytes differentiate into distinct colonic macrophage or dendritic cell subsets depending on the presence or absence of inflammation
mads-domain proteins are important transcription factors involved in many aspects of plant reproductive development. in this study, a mads-box gene, glycine max agamous-like1 (gmagl1), was isolated from soybean flower. the transcript of gmagl1 was expressed in flowers and pods of different stages in soybean and was highly expressed in carpels. gmagl1 is a nucleus-localized transcription factor and can interact directly with sep-like proteins in soybean flowers. ectopic overexpression of gmagl1 resulted in the absence of petals in arabidopsis. moreover, morphological changes in the valves were observed in 35s:gmagl1 arabidopsis fruits that dehisced before the seeds reached full maturity. gmagl1 was found to be sufficient to activate the expression of arabidopsis alc, ind, stk, sep1, and sep3. therefore, our data suggest that gmagl1 may play important roles in both floral organ identity and fruit dehiscence. the c-function, according to the abc model of floral organ identity, is required for stamen and carpel development and to provide floral meristem determinacy. members of the ag lineage of the large mads box gene family specify the c-function in a broadly conserved manner in angiosperms. in core eudicots, two sub-lineages co-exist, euag and ple, which have been extensively characterized in antirrhinum majus and arabidopsis thaliana, where strong sub-functionalization has led to highly divergent contributions of the respective paralogs to the c-function. various scenarios have been proposed to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the euag and ple lineages in eudicots, but detailed functional analyses of the roles of these genes in additional representative species to validate evolutionary hypotheses are scarce. here, we report functional characterization of euag- and ple-like genes in nicotiana benthamiana through expression analyses and phenotypic characterization of the defects caused by their specific down-regulation. we show that both paralogs redundantly contribute to the c-function in this species, providing insights on the likely evolution of these gene lineages following divergence of the major groups within the eudicots (rosids and asterids). moreover, we have demonstrated a conserved role for the ple-like genes in controlling fruit dehiscence, which strongly supports the ancestral role of ple-like genes in late fruit development and suggests a common evolutionary origin of late developmental processes in dry (dehiscent) and fleshy (ripening) fruits.
uncertainty about the future path of interest rates is associated with a significant slowing of future economic activity both at the aggregate and firm level. using a large data set on firms’ interest rate swap usage, we find that 1) interest rate risk management helps firms attenuate the adverse effects of interest rate uncertainty on investment and 2) there are significant crosssectional differences in swap usage according to asset and financing risk. to interpret these findings, we develop a dynamic model of corporate interest rate risk management in the presence of investment and financing frictions. we examine investment behavior when firms face costs in the access to external funds. we find that despite the existence of liquidity constraints, standard investment regressions predict that cash flow is an important determinant of investment only if one ignores q. conversely, we also obtain significant cash flow effects even in the absence of financial frictions. these findings provide support to the argument that the success of cash flow augmented investment regressions is probably due to a combination of measurement error in q and identification problems.
this dissertation studied issues pertaining to qos provision for multimedia applications at the application layer. we initially studied internet routing pathology and internet routing stability by repeating experimental and analytical methods conducted by paxson in 1996. no similar study was done in recent years. our findings show that routing behavior of the internet in 2006 are different from those reported in 1996 in some important aspects. second, we investigated different stochastic models (e.g. self-similar processes, auto-regressive integrated moving-average (arima)) in order to find a suitable model that describes available bandwidth over time of an end-to-end path between two internet hosts. our finding of the suitable model is beneficial to predicting of future values of available bandwidth along an end-to-end path. to the best of our knowledge, no similar study was conducted. third, we designed and evaluated a new path monitoring algorithm inferring available bandwidth of an end-to-end path without monitoring all the paths to minimize monitoring overhead. our algorithm does not rely on underlying network-layer topology information as required in topology-aware path monitoring techniques. finally, to complement the above study, we introduced our multicast protocol named "core-set routing" for transmitting multimedia data from a set of senders to a set of receivers, taking qos into account. the protocol is suitable for interactive multi-sender multimedia applications such as video conferencing and network gaming. recent network traffic studies argue that network arrival processes are much more faithfully modeled using statistically self-similar processes instead of traditional poisson processes [ltww94a, pf94]. one difficulty in dealing with self-similar models is how to efficiently synthesize traces (sample paths) corresponding to self-similar traffic. we present a fast fourier transform method for synthesizing approximate self-similar sample paths and assess its performance and validity. we find that the method is as fast or faster than existing methods and appears to generate a closer approximation to true self-similar sample paths than the other known fast method (random midpoint displacement). we then discuss issues in using such synthesized sample paths for simulating network traffic, and how an approximation used by our method can dramatically speed up evaluation of whittle`s estimator for h, the hurst parameter giving the strength of long-range dependence present in a self-similar time series.
this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and to identify risk factors associated with neospora spp. infection in horses in jordan. management related data were collected from each farm and individual horses. sera from 227 horses from 5 of 6 climatic regions in jordan were analyzed for the presence of antibodies to neospora spp. by elisa kit. the study was performed during spring of 2010. the association between seropositivity and risk factors was analyzed. a total of 7 (3%) of 227 sera had antibodies for neospora spp. there was a significant regional difference (p=0.018) between the 5 climatic regions. positive cases were located in amman and irbid, while the other regions (zarqa, jordan valley, and wadi mousa) had zero prevalence. the use of anthelmintics at least once a year resulted in a significant reduction of the seroprevalence to neospora spp. (1.6% vs 9.8%). however, this might be a phenomenon by chance and a better hygiene since owners can invest in anthelmintics. other risk factors such as age, gender, breed, usage, body condition score, grazing, presence of other animals mixed with the horses in the same property, and a history of previous diseases were not significantly associated with the seroprevalence to neospora spp. infection. this is the first study to report on the presence of neospora seropositive horses in jordan. further studies are warranted to better understand the role of certain risk factors in the transmission of neospora spp. among horse population and to determine which neospora spp. are responsible for the infection. sera from 800 asymptomatic horses were examined for the presence of antibodies to neospora caninum by immunofluorescence antibody test (ifat). the presence of antibodies to n. caninum was also tested in sera from 52 mares that had aborted and 40 horses exhibiting neurological signs. a total of 95 (11.9%) of the 800 sera had antibodies for neospora. significantly higher seropositivity was obtained from horses that had neurological signs (21.2%) and from aborted mares (37.5%). there was significant linear-by-linear association between age and seropositivity. this is the first serologic survey for neospora spp. antibodies performed on horses from the middle east and the first to report significant difference in seropositivity between asymptomatic horses and horses exhibiting neurological signs.
study question does surgical and low-dose progestin treatment differentially affect endometriosis-associated severe deep dyspareunia in terms of sexual functioning, psychological status and health-related quality of life?   summary answer surgery and progestin treatment achieved essentially similar benefits at 12-month follow-up, but with different temporal trends.   what is already known conservative surgery and hormonal therapies have been used independently for endometriosis-associated deep dyspareunia with inconsistent results.   study design, size, duration patient preference, parallel cohort study with 12-month follow-up. the effect of conservative surgery at laparoscopy versus treatment with a low dose of norethisterone acetate per os (2.5 mg/day) in women with persistent/recurrent severe deep dyspareunia after first-line surgery was compared.   participants/materials and setting, methods a total of 51 patients chose repeat surgery and 103 progestin treatment. variations in sexual function, psychological well-being and quality of life were measured by means of the female sexual function index (fsfi), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads) and the endometriosis health profile-30 (ehp-30).   main results and the role of chance four women in the surgery group and 21 women in the progestin group withdrew from the study for various reasons. total fsfi scores, anxiety and depression scores and ehp-30 scores improved immediately after surgery, but worsened with time, whereas the effect during progestin use increased more gradually, but progressively, without overall significant between-group differences at 12-month follow-up. a tendency was observed towards a slightly better total fsfi score after surgery at the end of the study period.   limitations, reasons for caution treatments were not randomly allocated, and distribution of participants as well as of dropouts between study arms was unbalanced. however, the possibility of choosing the treatment allowed assessment of the maximum potential effect size of the interventions.   wider implications of the findings both surgery and medical treatment with progestins are valuable options for improving the detrimental impact of endometriosis-associated dyspareunia on sexual functioning and quality of life. women should be aware of the pros and cons of both options to decide which one best suits their needs.   study funding/competing interest(s) this study was supported by a research grant from the university of milan school of medicine (pur number 2009-ate-0570). none of the authors have a conflict of interest. background among subjects with endometriosis and deep dyspareunia (dd), those with endometriosis of the uterosacral ligament (usle) have the most severe impairment of sexual function. this study examines the effect of laparoscopic excision of endometriosis on dd and quality of sex life.   methods this observational cohort prospective study included 68 women with endometriosis suffering dd (intensity of pain >or= 6 on a 10-cm visual analogue scale). patients underwent laparoscopic full excision of endometriosis. following surgery, they were asked to use nonhormonal contraception devices. before surgery, at 6- and at 12-month follow-up, patients answered a self-administered questionnaire based on the sexual satisfaction subscale of the derogatis sexual functioning inventory.   results at 6- and 12-month follow-up, women with and without usle had significant improvement in dd. subjects with usle reported increased variety in sex life, increased frequency of intercourse, more satisfying orgasms with sex, relaxing more easily during sex and being more relaxed and fulfilled after sex. similar improvements were observed among women without usle; however, for some variables statistical significance was not reached.   conclusions surgical excision of endometriosis improves not only dd but also the quality of sex life.
summarywe studied 7,897 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis to assess factors that influence health-related quality of life (hrqol). an increased number of comorbidities, fear of falling, and previous vertebral fracture were associated with significant reductions in hrqol. understanding the factors that affect hrqol may improve management of these patients.introductionhrqol is impaired in women treated for postmenopausal osteoporosis (pmo). the objective of this study was to examine the relationship between clinical characteristics, comorbidities, medical history, patient demographics, and hrqol in women with pmo.methodsbaseline data were obtained and combined from two large and similar multinational observational studies: prospective observational scientific study investigating bone loss experience in europe (possible eu®) and in the us (possible us™) including postmenopausal women in primary care settings initiating or switching bone loss treatment, or who had been on bone loss treatment for some time. hrqol measured by health utility scores (eq-5d™) were available for 7,897 women (94 % of study participants). the relationship between hrqol and baseline clinical characteristics, medical history and patient demographics was assessed using parsimonious, multivariable, mixed-model analyses.resultsmedian health utility score was 0.80 (interquartile range 0.69–1.00). in multivariable analyses, young age, low body mass index, previous vertebral fracture, increased number of comorbidities, high fear of falling, and depression were associated with reduced hrqol. regression-based model estimates showed that previous vertebral fracture was associated with lower health utility scores by 0.08 (10.3 %) and demonstrated the impact of multiple comorbidities and of fear of falling on hrqol.conclusionsin this large observational study of women with pmo, there was substantial interindividual variability in hrqol. an increased number of comorbidities, fear of falling, and previous vertebral fracture were associated with significant reductions in hrqol. introductionan important component of cost effectiveness models in the field of osteoporosis is the set of health state utility values (hsuvs) used for key fracture outcomes. this paper presents a review of hsuvs for key osteoporotic states (hip, wrist, shoulder, clinical, and morphometric vertebral fractures, established osteoporosis, and interaction of several fractures). it provides an update to the systematic review conducted by brazier et al. (osteoporos int 13(10):768–776, 2002).materials and methodsa systematic search was undertaken of the main literature databases for hsuvs for established osteoporosis, vertebral, hip, wrist, and shoulder fractures were identified. studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed in terms of the patient population, the method of describing health (if not obtained directly from patients), the method of valuing health states and the source of values.resultsestimates of health state utility values were found across the osteoporosis conditions from 27 studies. a wide range of empirical estimates were found, partly due to differences in valuation technique (vas, sg, tto), descriptive system and differences in respondents (population or patient), the perspective of the task (own health or a scenario), sample size, and study quality.conclusionthe paper provides a set of multipliers representing the loss in hsuvs for use as a “reference case” in cost-effectiveness models.
several parameters and risk factors were compared between korean male myocardial infarction (mi) patients (n = 10) and angina pectoris (ap) patients (n = 17) to search unique biomarkers for myocardial infarction (mi) in lipoprotein level. individual serum and lipoprotein fractions (vldl, ldl, hdl2, hdl3) were isolated and analyzed by lipid and protein determination and enzyme assay. the mi group was found to have a 25 and 30% higher serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol (tg) level than the ap group, respectively, however, their body mass index (bmi), ldl-cholesterol (c), hdl-c, and glucose levels fell within the normal range. mi patients were found to have an approximately two-fold higher level of serum il-6 and an 18% lower serum apoa-i level than that of the ap group. ldl and hdl2 fraction of the mi group were more enriched with tg than those of ap group. the increased tg was correlated well with the increased level of apoc-iii in the same fraction. cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp) activity and protein level were greatly increased in mi patients in the ldl and hdl3 fractions. mi patients showed more severely oxidized ldl fraction than patients in the ap group, as well as the weakest antioxidant ability of serum. conclusively, mi patients were found to have unique serum and lipoprotein characteristics including increased il-6 and tg in serum, with cetp and apoc-iii in the ldl and hdl fractions, as well as severely impaired antioxidant ability of hdl. we thank drs robert adams, gary friday, philip gorelick, and sylvia wasserthiel-smoller, members of stroke statistics subcommittee; drs joe broderick, brian eigel, kimberlee gauveau, jane khoury, jerry potts, jane newburger, and kathryn taubert; and sean coady and michael wolz for their valuable comments and contributions. we acknowledge tim anderson and tom schneider for their editorial contributions and karen modesitt for her administrative assistance.    view this table:  writing group disclosures     # summary {#article-title-2}  each year the american heart association, in conjunction with the centers for disease control and prevention, the national institutes of health, and other government agencies, brings together the most up-to-date statistics on heart disease, stroke, and their risk factors and presents them in its heart disease and stroke statistical update. the statistical update is a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, healthcare policy makers, media, the lay public, and many others who seek the …
this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of human papilloma virus (hpv), herpes simplex virus‐1/‐2 (hsv‐1/‐2), varicella‐zoster virus (vzv), epstein–barr virus (ebv), cytomegalovirus (cmv), and human herpes virus‐6/‐7 (hhv‐6/‐7) in 23 human nasal polyps by applying pcr. two types of control tissues were used: adjacent inferior/middle turbinates from the patients and inferior/middle turbinates from 13 patients undergoing nasal corrective surgery. ebv was the virus most frequently detected (35%), followed by hpv (13%), hsv‐1 (9%), and cmv (4%). the cmv‐positive polyp was simultaneously positive for hsv‐1. hpv was also detected in the adjacent turbinates (4%) and the adjacent middle turbinate (4%) of one of the hpv‐positive patients. ebv, hsv, and cmv were not detected in the adjacent turbinates of the ebv‐, hsv‐ or cmv‐positive patients. all mucosae were negative for the vzv, hhv‐6, and hhv‐7. this is the first study to deal with the involvement of a comparable group of viruses in human nasal polyposis. the findings support the theory that the presence of viral ebv markedly influences the pathogenesis of these benign nasal tumors. the low incidence of hpv detected confirms the hypothesis that hpv is correlated with infectious mucosal lesions to a lesser extent than it is with proliferative lesions, such as inverted papilloma. the low incidence of hsv‐1 and cmv confirms that these two herpes viruses may play a minor role in the development of nasal polyposis. double infection with hsv‐1 and cmv may also play a minor, though causative, role in nasal polyp development. vzv and hhv‐6/‐7 do not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of these mucosal lesions. j. med. virol. 81:1613–1619, 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc. primary nasal lymphomas of t or nk cell origin are known to be associated with epstein-barr virus (ebv). however, it is not known whether ebv is normally present in nasal mucosa as distinct to nasopharyngeal tissue. this study investigates the prevalence of ebv infection in 13 cases of nasal polyps. ebv dna was detected in 2 of 13 (15%) by southern blot hybridization and in 9 of 13 (69%) by polymerase chain reaction. in situ hybridization for ebv-encoded small nuclear rnas (eber) was positive in 11 of 13 (85%) cases; the virus was present in stromal lymphocytes only and not in the epithelial cells. immunohistochemistry for ebv proteins in 7 cases revealed ebv nuclear antigen (ebna)-2, latent membrane protein (lmp)-1, and zebra (the switch protein encoded by gene bzlf1) expression in rare isolated stromal lymphocytes in 3 cases. double immunostaining in 1 case showed that the lmp-1+ cells were b or t cells. immunohistochemistry for ebv lytic proteins showed very rare viral capsid antigen (vca)+ and membrane antigen (ma)+ cells in 1 case and very rare diffuse early antigen (ea-d)+ and vca+ cells in 1 other case. the expression of zebra, ea-d, vca, and ma suggested a disruption of latency in very rare stromal lymphocytes leading to a productive cycle. although the incidence of ebv positivity in nasal polyps in our population is high (85%), very low numbers of ebv+ cells are found in each case. nevertheless, they indicate that nasal mucosa could be one of the sites of ebv persistence through a low level of infection of the resident lymphocytes and thereby provide a possible setting for the emergence of virally associated tumors in this site.
dosage compensation, the process whereby expression of sex-linked genes remains similar between sexes (despite heterogamety) and balanced with autosomal expression, was long believed to be essential. however, recent research has shown that several lineages, including birds, butterflies, monotremes and sticklebacks, lack chromosome-wide dosage compensation mechanisms and do not completely balance the expression of sex-linked and autosomal genes. to obtain further understanding of avian sex-biased gene expression, we studied z-linked gene expression in the brain of two songbirds of different genera (zebra finch, taeniopygia guttata, and common whitethroat, sylvia communis) using microarray technology. in both species, the male-bias in gene expression was significantly higher for z than for autosomes, although the ratio of z-linked to autosomal expression (z:a) was relatively close to one in both sexes (range: 0.89–1.01). interestingly, the z-linked male-bias in gene expression increased with expression level, and genes with low expression showed the lowest degree of sex-bias. these results support the view that the heterogametic females have up-regulated their single z-linked homologues to a high extent when the w-chromosome degraded and thereby managed to largely balance their z:a expression with the exception of highly expressed genes. the male-bias in highly expressed genes points towards male-driven selection on z-linked loci, and this and other possible hypotheses are discussed. the determination of the chimpanzee genome sequence provides a means to study both structural and functional aspects of the evolution of the human genome. here we compare humans and chimpanzees with respect to differences in expression levels and protein-coding sequences for genes active in brain, heart, liver, kidney, and testis. we find that the patterns of differences in gene expression and gene sequences are markedly similar. in particular, there is a gradation of selective constraints among the tissues so that the brain shows the least differences between the species whereas liver shows the most. furthermore, expression levels as well as amino acid sequences of genes active in more tissues have diverged less between the species than have genes active in fewer tissues. in general, these patterns are consistent with a model of neutral evolution with negative selection. however, for x-chromosomal genes expressed in testis, patterns suggestive of positive selection on sequence changes as well as expression changes are seen. furthermore, although genes expressed in the brain have changed less than have genes expressed in other tissues, in agreement with previous work we find that genes active in brain have accumulated more changes on the human than on the chimpanzee lineage.
objective: our objective is to analyze the significance of mobility of the ureterovesical junction (uvj-m) and poster urethrovesical angle (puva) in diagnosing stress urinary incontinence (sui) in women, providing a reference for clinical diagnosis of sui.  methods: a total of 90 female sui patients admitted in our hospital between january, 2015-january, 2016 were selected as observation group, and 90 healthy women were selected as control group. urodynamic indexes were detected; uvj-m and puva were determined by ultrasound. the above indexes in two groups were compared to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of ultrasound in diagnosing sui in women.  results: post-void residual volume (pvr), bladder volume, functional urethral length (ful) were not statistically different between two groups (p>0.05), the maximum flow rate (qmax) and abdominal leak point pressure (alpp) in the observation group were higher than the control group, the maximum urethral closure pressure (mucp) was lower than the control group, the differences were statistically significant (p 15 mm and puva at increased abdominal pressure stage >140° as the criteria to diagnose sui, the sensitivity was 90.00% and the specificity was 86.67%.  conclusion: uvj-m and puva evaluated by ultrasound are significant in diagnosing sui in women, the advantages such as the non-invasion and convenience may establish a basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of sui. purpose occult tethered cord syndrome, in which there is normal neuroanatomic imaging despite clinical and urodynamic evidence of neuropathic bladder behavior, is controversial. several uncontrolled series describe improvement in bladder function following section of the filum terminale. we performed a pilot randomized, controlled study comparing medical treatment to surgical section of the filum plus medical treatment in children with occult tethered cord syndrome.   materials and methods children refractory to standard medical management for 1 year or more with normal conus position on magnetic resonance imaging and abnormal urodynamics were randomized. exclusion criteria included any neurological conditions, spinal dysraphism, bladder outlet obstruction and an atonic bladder. patients were assessed at randomization and 1 year later with a standardized urodynamic score, the validated pemqol (pediatric enuresis module on quality of life™) scale, and a validated bowel and bladder dysfunction score.   results after 8 years we accrued 21 patients. the bowel and bladder dysfunction score improved in the surgical and medical arms (20% and 24%) and the urodynamic score improved slightly (6% and 4%, respectively). the pemqol child and family impact scales improved modestly in both groups. all differences were nonsignificant. interim analysis indicated that more than 700 patients in each arm would be required to demonstrate a statistical difference with respect to urodynamic score based on our preliminary data.   conclusions there appears to be no objective difference in urological outcome between medical management plus or minus filum section for patients with occult tethered cord syndrome. these data challenge the existence of the concept of occult tethered cord syndrome, in which bowel and bladder dysfunction score is attributed to tethering by the filum despite a normally located conus.
summaryobjective. gender differences in clinical presentation and response to sertraline treatment were examined for patients diagnosed with dsm-iii-r panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.  method. data was pooled from 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient studies (males, n = 335; females, n = 338). two were 12-week fixed-dose studies (sertraline 50 mg vs. 100 mg vs. 200 mg) and 2 were 10-week flexible-dose studies (sertraline 50–200 mg). primary outcome measures consisted of the clinical global impression-improvement scale (cgi-i) and change in panic attack frequency.  results. the clinical presentation of panic disorder was similar except that men reported an earlier age of onset, shorter duration of illness, and significantly more frequent history of alcohol and/or substance dependence/abuse. sertraline was significantly more effective than placebo in both women and men on the 2 primary outcome measures. when between-sex efficacy was compared, women achieved significantly greater improvement than men on panic frequency and cgi-i, but had equivalent improvement on all other measures. there was no significant between-sex difference in study completion rates, or in adverse event profiles.  conclusions. there was a modest but consistent trend for women to show superior efficacy at the end of acute sertraline treatment. this gender effect only occasionally achieved significance, and must be confirmed by future treatment research. unlabelled a gradual decline in estrogen levels after the age of 40 may contribute to a higher rate of depression in women over 45 years of age. estrogen replacement therapy (ert) has been shown to produce cognitive and mood-enhancing effects in women and may facilitate antidepressant activity.   methods we examined the efficacy rates in women on ert > or = 45 years (n = 40) compared to women > or = 45 years not on ert (n = 132) and to women < 45 years (n = 396) and to men (n = 262) with major depression during fluoxetine 20 mg daily up to 8 weeks. remitters with a ham-d17 score < or = 7 from week 9 to 12 were then treated up to 1-year in a placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial.   results efficacy rates were similar in women > or = 45 years on ert when compared to women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine alone, and when compared to women < 45 years and men taking fluoxetine. a kaplan-meier survival analysis in fluoxetine responders treated up to 26 weeks showed a somewhat greater relapse rate in women > or = 45 years taking ert compared to other treatment groups (p < 0.06).   limitations this study was retrospective nature and ert was given in an uncontrolled fashion: 63% of women received estrogen alone while 37% also took intermittent progesterone. other variables include the absence of hormonal documentation of menopausal status, no direct assessment of ert compliance and the use of fixed-dose fluoxetine 20 mg daily.   conclusion in contrast to prior reports suggesting that ert may facilitate antidepressant activity, we observed similar efficacy in depressed women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine plus ert compared to those taking fluoxetine alone.
in maize breeding, genomic prediction may be an efficient tool for selecting single-crosses evaluated under abiotic stress conditions. in addition, a promising strategy is applying multiple-trait genomic prediction using selection indices (sis), increasing genetics gains and reducing time per cycles. in this study, we aimed (i) to compare accuracy of single- and multi-trait genomic prediction (stgp; mtgp) in two maize datasets, (ii) to evaluate prediction of four selection indices that could contribute to the selection of tropical maize hybrids under contrasting nitrogen conditions, and (iii) to compare the use of linear (gblup) and nonlinear (rkhs/gk) kernels in stgp and mtgp analyses. for either single-trait gblup and rkhs analyses, the highest values obtained for accuracy were 0.40 and 0.41 using harmonic mean (hm), respectively. from multi-trait gblup and gk, using the combination of selection indices in mtgp seems to be suitable, increasing the accuracy. adding grain yield and plant height in mtgp showed a slight improvement in accuracy compared to stgp. in general, there was a modest benefit of using single-trait rkhs and gk multi-trait, rather than gblup. new proposals for models and applications of prediction processes with data on molecular markers may help reduce the financial costs of and identify superior genotypes in maize breeding programs. studies evaluating genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gblup) models including dominance effects have not been performed in the univariate and multivariate context in the data analysis of this crop. a single cross hybrid construction procedure was performed in this study using phenotypic data and actual molecular markers of 4,091 maize lines from the public database panzea. a total of 400 simple hybrids resulting from this process were analyzed using the univariate and multivariate gblup model considering only additive effects additive plus dominance effects. historic heritability scenarios of five traits and other genetic architecture settings were used to compare models, evaluating the predictive ability and estimation of variance components. marginal differences were detected between the multivariate and univariate models. the main explanation for the small discrepancy between models is the low- to moderate-magnitude correlations between the traits studied and moderate heritabilities. these conditions do not favor the advantages of multivariate analysis. the inclusion of dominance effects in the models was an efficient strategy to improve the predictive ability and estimation quality of variance components.
backgroundit remains a matter of debate whether colorectal cancer resection in an emergency setting negatively impacts on survival. our objective was therefore to assess the impact of urgent versus elective operation on overall and disease-free survival in patients undergoing resection for colorectal cancer by using propensity score adjusted analysis.methodsin a single-center study patients operated for colorectal cancer between 1989 and 2013 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. median follow-up was 44 months. patients with neoadjuvant treatment were excluded. the impact of urgent operation on overall and disease-free survival was assessed using both cox regression and propensity score analyses.resultsof 747 patients with colorectal cancer, 84 (11 %) had urgent and 663 elective cancer resection. the propensity score revealed strongly biased patient characteristics (0.22 ± 0.16 vs. 0.10 ± 0.09; p < 0.001). in unadjusted analysis urgent operation was associated with a 35 % increased risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio(hr) of death = 1.35, 95 % confidence interval(ci):1.02–1.78, p = 0.045). in risk-adjusted cox regression analysis urgent operation was not associated with poor overall (hr = 1.08, 95 %ci:0.79–1.48; p = 0.629) or disease-free survival (hr = 1.02, 95 %ci:0.76–1.38; p = 0.877). similarly in propensity score analysis urgent operation did not influence overall (hr = 0.98, 95 % ci:0.74–1.29), p = 0.872) and disease-free survival (hr = 0.89, 95 %ci:0.68 to 1.16, p = 0.387).conclusionsthis study provides evidence that worse oncologic outcomes after urgent operation for colorectal cancer are caused by clinical circumstances and not due to the urgent operation itself. urgent operation is not a risk factor for colorectal cancer resection. background although a significantly decreased long-term survival has been observed in patients undergoing surgery for complicated colorectal tumors compared with uncomplicated ones, the role of radical oncologic surgery on emergency colonic cancer is not defined clearly. the aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of a curative emergency surgery in terms of tumor recurrence and cancer-related survival compared with elective colonic surgery.   methods between january 1996 and december 1998, all patients with colonic cancer deemed to have undergone a curative resection were considered for inclusion in this prospective study. patients were classified into 2 groups: group 1, after emergency surgery for complicated colonic cancer, and group 2, patients undergoing elective surgery. the main end points were cancer-related survival and the probability of being free from recurrence at 3 years.   results of the 266 patients included in the study, 59 patients (22.2%) were in group 1 and 207 patients (77.8%) were in group 2. postoperative mortality was higher in group 1 (p=.0004). after patients were stratified by the tumor node metastasis system, differences between the groups with respect to overall survival of stage ii tumors (p=.0728), the probability of being free from recurrence (p=.0827), and cancer-related survival (p=.1071) of stage iii cancers did not reach statistical significance. differences were observed for the overall survival in stage iii tumors (p=.0007), and for the probability of being free from recurrence (p=.0011) and cancer-related survival (p=.0029) in stage ii cancers. when patients with elective stage ii tumors presenting 1 or more negative prognostic factor were compared with emergency patients affected by a stage ii colonic cancer, no differences were observed.   conclusion curative surgeries for complicated colonic cancer are acceptable in emergency conditions. cancer-related survival and recurrence in patients with complicated colonic cancers may approach that of elective surgery if a surgical treatment with radical oncologic criteria is performed.
let $g$ be a graph and $\mathcal{s}$ be a subset of $z$. a vertex-coloring $\mathcal{s}$-edge-weighting of $g$ is an assignment of weights by the elements of $\mathcal{s}$ to each edge of $g$ so that adjacent vertices have different sums of incident edges weights. it was proved that every 3-connected bipartite graph admits a vertex-coloring $\mathcal{s}$-edge-weighting for $\mathcal{s} = \{1,2 \}$ (h. lu, q. yu and c. zhang, vertex-coloring 2-edge-weighting of graphs, european j. combin., 32 (2011), 22-27). in this paper, we show that every 2-connected and 3-edge-connected bipartite graph admits a vertex-coloring $\mathcal{s}$-edge-weighting for $\mathcal{s} \in \{ \{ 0,1 \} , \{1,2 \} \}$. these bounds we obtain are tight, since there exists a family of infinite bipartite graphs which are 2-connected and do not admit vertex-coloring $\mathcal{s}$-edge-weightings for $\mathcal{s} \in \{ \{ 0,1 \} , \{1,2 \} \}$. a partition of the edges of a graph g into sets {s1,..., sk} defines a multiset xv for each vertex v where the multiplicity of i in xv is the number of edges incident to v in si we show that the edges of every graph can be partitioned into 4 sets such that the resultant multisets give a vertex colouring of g. in other words, for every edge (u, v) of g, xu ≠ xv. furthermore, if g has minimum degree at least 1000, then there is a partition of e(g) into 3 sets such that the corresponding multisets yield a vertex colouring.
background the purpose of the current study was to determine the effects of preoperative cigarette smoking and the carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath on perioperative respiratory complications in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies.   methods one hundred and fifty two patients (smokers, group s and non-smokers, group ns), who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomies under general anesthesia, were studied. patients completed the fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence. the preoperative carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath levels were determined using the pico+smokerlyzer 12h before surgery. respiratory complications were recorded during induction of anesthesia, intraoperatively, during extubation, and in the recovery room.   results statistically significant increases were noted in group s with respect to the incidence of hypoxia during induction of anesthesia, intraoperative bronchospasm, bronchodilator treatment intraoperatively, and bronchospasm during extubation. the carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath and the fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, and number of cigarettes smoked 12h preoperatively were designated as covariates in the regression model. logistic regression analysis of anesthetic induction showed that a 1 unit increase in the carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath level was associated with a 1.16 fold increase in the risk of hypoxia (or=1.16; 95% ci 1.01-1.34; p=0.038). logistic regression analysis of the intraoperative course showed that a 1 unit increase in the number of cigarettes smoked 12h preoperatively was associated with a 1.16 fold increase in the risk of bronchospasm (or=1.16; 95% ci 1.04-1.30; p=0.007). while in the recovery room, a 1 unit increase in the fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence score resulted in a 1.73 fold increase in the risk of bronchospasm (or=1.73; 95% ci 1.04-2.88; p=0.036).   conclusions cigarette smoking was shown to increase the incidence of intraoperative respiratory complications while under general anesthesia. moreover, the estimated preoperative carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath level may serve as an indicator of the potential risk of perioperative respiratory complications. background smoking is considered to be a risk factor for patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia, but it is unclear whether this is applicable to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. the aim of this study was to determine the risk of respiratory complications and wound infection among smokers. methods the authors studied a random selection of 489 adult patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. smoking status was determined by self-report and confirmed with end-expired carbon monoxide analysis. the risk of respiratory complications (i.e., desaturation, cough, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, breath-holding, or apnea) and wound infection (i.e., wound redness or discharge ± positive microbial culture, requiring antibiotic therapy) in smokers versus nonsmokers was ascertained. odds ratios were estimated from multivariable logistic regression and adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, partner's smoking status, domiciliary smoking exposure, and extent and duration of surgery. results most smokers continued to smoke up until the day of surgery. smokers had a higher rate of respiratory complications (32.8%vs. 25.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.84;p = 0.038) and wound infection (3.6%vs. 0.6%; odds ratio, 16.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.58–175;p = 0.019). odds ratios comparing current plus ex-smokers with nonsmokers were of similar magnitude for most of these complications. conclusions smoking was associated with an increased risk of respiratory complications and postoperative wound infection in ambulatory surgery patients. these findings warrant increased efforts at promoting smoking avoidance and cessation.
backgroundmycophenolate mofetil (mmf) has long been used to manage lupus nephritis. despite research on its long-term efficacy, it is still warranted to conduct further investigation regarding its indications, safety and outcome. this study was intended to evaluate our proposed protocol in maintenance therapy with mmf.twenty-four lupus nephritis patients were registered prior to their receiving 3–6 month induction therapy with monthly iv pulses of cyclophosphamide (cyc), followed by 24 month maintenance therapy using mmf and steroid. we defined end points as achievement of complete and partial remission, relapse, refractory to therapy as well as end stage renal disease (esrd) and death. friedman and repeated measurement tests were used to assess the effect of treatment on parameters over time.complete renal remission was achieved in 79.16% until the end of the last follow up with an average period of 12.45 ± 7.37 months since treatment commenced. significant statistical differences were seen regarding proteinuria, hematuria, leukocyturia, plasma creatinine, c3, c4 before and after therapy (p < 0.05): plasma creatinine and proteinurea falling from 0.96 ± 0.65 to 0.75 ± 0.19 mg/dl (p < 0.14) and from 1.64 ± 1.12 to 0.27 ± 0.60 gr/24 h (p < 0.001). by the end of 24-month, 95.8% of patients had been in remission. four episodes of relapse ended in remission followed by retreatment. no life-threatening side effects were observed in 66.6% of patients with fourteen cases of infection (58.3%). none of them developed esrd.maintenance therapy with mmf was shown to yield favorable outcome with minimal complications, in treating lupus nephritis (irct2012071710313n1). the aim of this study was to assess the efficacies and toxicities of immunosuppressive treatments for lupus nephritis (ln) versus cyclophosphamide (cyc). a meta-analysis was performed to determine treatment efficacy and toxicity outcomes between mycophenolate mofetil (mmf) and cyc induction therapies, between mmf and azathioprine (aza) as maintenance therapies, and between low-dose intravenous (iv) cyc and high-dose iv cyc therapy. ten randomized controlled trials (rcts) were included in the meta-analysis. in terms of induction therapies, mmf did not increase complete remission or partial remission rates as compared with cyc. however, the relative risks (rrs) of amenorrhea and leukopenia tended to be lower in the mmf group than in the cyc group. meta-analysis of mmf versus aza as a maintenance therapy showed no difference between the two groups in terms of response rates or the risk of developing end-stage renal disease. low-dose iv cyc therapy had lower relapse rates than high-dose iv cyc therapy (rr 0.465, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.261—0.830, p-value 0.010), and was associated with a lower infection risk (rr 0.688, 95% ci 0.523—0.905, p-value 0.008). in conclusion, mmf was found to be as effective as cyc and tended to have a better safety profile as an induction therapy for ln than cyc.
this study investigated patterns of motor brain activation, white matter (wm) integrity of inter- and intrahemispheric connectivity and their associations with hand function in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (cp-u). fourteen cp-u (mean age 10.6 ± 2.7 years) and 14 typically developing children (tdc) underwent magnetic resonance imaging. cp-u underwent extensive motor evaluation. pattern of brain activation during a motor task was studied in 12 cp-u and six tdc, by calculating laterality index (li) and percent activation in the sensorimotor areas (around the central sulcus), and quantifying the activation in the supplementary motor area (sma). diffusivity parameters were measured in cp-u and eight other tdc for the corpus callosum (cc), affected and less affected cortico-spinal tracts (cst), and posterior limb of the internal capsule (plic). abnormal patterns of brain activation were detected in areas around the central sulcus in 9/12 cp-u, with bilateral activation and/or reduced percent activation. more activation in areas around the central sulcus of the affected hemisphere was associated with better hand function. cp-u demonstrated more activation in the sma when moving the affected hand compared to the less affected hand. cp-u displayed reduced wm integrity compared to tdc, in the midbody and splenium of the cc, affected cst and affected plic. wm integrity in these tracts was correlated with hand function. while abnormal pattern of brain activation was detected mainly when moving the affected hand, the integrity of the cc was correlated with function of both hands and bimanual skills. this study highlights the importance of interhemispheric connectivity for hand function in cp-u, which may have clinical implications regarding prognosis and management. objective to examine the reorganisation of the somatosensory system after early brain lesions.   methods we studied 12 young patients with congenital hemiplegia. causative lesions were brain malformations, periventricular injuries and cortico-subcortical lesions. we explored the somatosensory system using evoked potentials, fmri during sensory stimulation and clinical assessment of sensory function. to correlate sensory and motor function, we also performed transcranial magnetic stimulation, fmri of hand movement and assessment of motor function by means of melbourne test.   results eleven patients showed a perilesional reorganisation of primary somatosensory function, as expressed by short latency potentials following stimulation of the paretic hand; in a remaining patient, delayed latency responses (n27.1) were only elicited over the ipsilateral undamaged hemisphere. five of the eleven patients with perilesional somatosensory representation of the affected hand showed contralesional shifting of motor function, thus exhibiting sensory-motor dissociation. significant correlation was found between sensory deficit and fmri activation during sensory stimulation.   conclusions in subjects with early brain lesions, somato-sensory function is generally reorganised within the affected hemisphere. a contralesional shifting is uncommon and poorly efficient in function restoration.   significance this study confirms and further explores the difference in reorganisation capabilities of the motor and sensory system following early brain injury of different etiologies and timing.
rationale studies strongly suggest that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors for nicotine (nachrs) play a significant role in lung cancer predisposition and natural history. the nachr alpha7 subunit has been found to be pivotal in the control of nicotine-induced lung cancer development and in growth signal transduction induced by nicotine binding to nachrs.   objectives to investigate the anticancer effects of alpha7-nachr antagonists.   methods (1) to check the correlation between alpha7-nachr presence and alpha-cobratoxin (alpha-cbt) sensitivity, binding experiments were performed in various normal human cells, lung cancer cell lines, and primary tumoral cells; (2) to demonstrate that alpha-cbt might be an efficient adjuvant therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) we expanded our previous observations to a panel of nsclcs of various subtypes orthotopically grafted on nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice; (3) to gain insight into the mechanism of alpha-cbt-induced tumor reduction, the cells obtained after enzymatic digestion of tumors were analyzed for procaspase-9, bax, bad, and bcl-x(l) protein; and (4) snail/e-cadherin expression was evaluated to acquire information about the chemoresistance of cancer cells to alpha-cbt.   measurements and main results we report herein the results of an experimental strategy aimed at investigating the antitumor effects of a powerful alpha7-nachr antagonist, alpha-cbt, in an in vivo setting set to mimic the clinical setting of lung cancer; in addition, a possible explanation for alpha-cbt selectivity toward cancer cells is presented.   conclusions we report the prolonged survival of alpha-cbt-treated animals in our mouse model of nsclc, which is most likely the result of multiple mechanisms, including various antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects. retraction: the following article from international journal of cancer, "inhibition of non‐neuronal α7‐nicotinic receptor reduces tumorigenicity in a549 nsclc xenografts", by laura paleari, fausto sessa, alessia catassi, denis servent, gilles mourier, guido doria‐miglietta, emanuela ognio, michele cilli, lorenzo dominioni, massimo paolucci, andrea calcaterra, alfredo cesario, stefano margaritora, pierluigi granone and patrizia russo, published online in wiley interscience (http://www3.interscience.wiley.com) on 22 january 2009, volume 125, issue 1, pages 199‐211, has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal editor in chief, peter lichter, and wiley periodicals, inc. the retraction has been agreed due to unverified data.
all but one of the health equity funds (hefs) currently operating in cambodia, introduced to address the adverse effects of low user fee exemption rates, rely heavily on external funding and have high administrative overheads. this article reports on a study of one type of hef, based in kirivong operational health district (kod) and operated through local pagoda structures, which demonstrates minimal reliance on external funding and low administrative overheads. we utilize an adapted sustainability assessment framework to assess the ability of pagoda structures to enable financial access for the poorest to public sector health services. we further analyse the strengths and limitations of the pagoda-managed equity fund initiative, with a view to assessing not only its sustainability but its potential for replication in other settings.our study shows that, against key sustainability indicators (health service utilization and health outcomes; management capacity and financial viability; community mobilization and government support), the pagoda-managed equity fund initiative scores well. however, it is evident that some external financial support is needed to allow the hefs to function effectively. we conclude with recommendations for replicating the initiative, which include working innovatively with indigenous grassroots organizations to enhance community hef ownership and to keep administrative overheads low. sustainability continues to be a serious concern for primary health care (phc) interventions targeting the death of millions of children in developing countries each year. our work with over 30 non-governmental organizations (ngos) implementing usaid's child survival and health grants program (cshgp)-funded projects revealed the need for a study to develop a framework for sustainability assessment in these projects. we surveyed ngo informants and project managers through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. this paper summarizes our study findings. the ngos share key values about sustainability, but are skeptical about approaches perceived as disconnected from field reality. in their experience, sustainable achievements occur through the interaction of capable local stakeholders and communities. this depends strongly on enabling conditions, which ngo projects should advance. sustainability assessment is multidimensional, value-based and embeds health within a larger sustainable development perspective. it reduces, but does not eliminate, the unpredictability of long-term outcomes. it should start with the consideration of the 'local systems' which need to develop a common purpose. our ability to address the complexity inherent to sustainability thinking rests with the validity of the models used to design interventions. a participant, qualitative research approach helped us make sense of sustainability in ngo field practice.
using 17α-ethinyl estradiol (ee2) and dibutyl phthalate (dbp) as a typical estrogen and phthalate ester, respectively, their combined in vivo effects on zebrafish (danio rerio) were investigated from the juvenile state to the adult stage. the authors spiked ee2 (5 ng/l and 20 ng/l) and dbp (0.1 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l) either individually or in mixture. at 45 d postfertilization (dpf), the survival rate of zebrafish was comparable in all treatments. dibutyl phthalate did not induce vitellogenin (vtg) synthesis, and no interaction was found between ee2 and dbp on vtg induction. at 90 dpf, both liver and gill were subject to more severe damage (lipid vacuoles of hepatocytes, amalgamation of gill lamellae, and clubbing at the tips of the secondary lamellae) when coexposed to these 2 chemicals, compared with single exposure. at 115 dpf, generally none of the binary mixture groups showed significantly different growth and sex ratios compared with the corresponding ee2 alone groups. in conclusion, no obvious interactions were detected between ee2 and dbp on the growth, vtg induction, or sex ratio of zebrafish, and they may act independently. however, the influence on morphology of gonad, liver, and gill induced by exposure to the mixture of ee2 and dbp was generally more potent than that by single exposure to ee2 or dbp, indicating the combined long-term harmful effects of ee2 and dbp on the development of zebrafish. environ toxicol chem 2015;34:518-526. © 2014 setac. phthalate ester plasticizers are antiandrogenic in mammals. high doses of certain phthalates consistently interfere with the normal development of male offspring exposed in utero, causing disrupted sperm production, abnormal development of the genitalia, and in some cases infertility. in the environment, phthalates are considered ubiquitous and are commonly measured in aquatic ecosystems at low nanograms to micrograms per liter concentrations. given the similarity between mammalian and teleost endocrine systems, phthalate esters may be able to cause antiandrogenic endocrine disruption in fish in the wild. in the present study, adult male three-spined sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculetaus; n = 8) were exposed to di-n-butyl phthalate (dbp; 0, 15, and 35 µg dbp/l) for 22 d and analyzed for changes in nesting behavior, plasma androgen concentrations, spiggin concentrations, and steroidogenic gene expression. plasma testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in males from the 35 µg dbp/l group compared with the solvent control, whereas plasma 11-ketotestosterone concentrations were not significantly affected. expression of steroid acute regulatory protein and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase remained unchanged. spiggin concentrations were significantly lower in the males exposed to 35 µg dbp/l. nest building appeared to be slower in some males exposed to dbp, but this was not statistically significant. these results suggest that dbp has antiandrogenic effects in fish. however, further research is required to firmly establish the consequences of chronic dbp exposure in fish.
objectives this analysis of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) evaluated the susceptibility patterns of enterobacteriaceae in latin america in 2008, with emphasis on susceptibility trends of e. coli and k. pneumoniae.   methods clinical isolates were recovered from intra-abdominal infections (iai) from 23 centers in 10 latin american countries. isolates were sent to a central laboratory for confirmation of identification, antimicrobial susceptibility and esbl testing, following the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines.   results of 1,003 gram-negative bacilli collected from intra-abdominal infections, e. coli and k. pneumoniae were the most commonly isolated organisms, and 26.8% of e. coli and 37.7% of k. pneumoniae were esbl positive. ertapenem and imipenem were the most consistently active agents tested; 99% of esbl-positive e. coli isolates were susceptible to ertapenem and 100% to imipenem as well, and 91% of esbl-positive k. pneumoniae were susceptible to ertapenem and 98% to imipenem. quinolones and cephalosporins were less active, achieving 1.5% to 76% inhibition against esbl-producing e. coli and 3.5% to 61% inhibition against k. pneumoniae.   conclusions local and unit-specific surveillance data is particularly important for selection of empiric therapy and in community-acquired infections as they can help the clinician with antibiotic selection by providing guidance regarding the likely pathogens and their resistance profiles. our data also confirm the increasing frequency with which esbl-producing organisms are found in the community setting, with 31.4% of community-acquired and 24.9% of hospital-acquired infections found to produce esbls. imipenem and ertapenem are the most active agents tested for esbl-positive e. coli and k. pneumoniae. background the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) was begun in 2002 to monitor international drug-resistance patterns among aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections.   methods in 2002, 40 medical centers from 17 countries collected consecutive non-duplicate isolates from intra-abdominal infections for susceptibility testing against 12 antimicrobial agents using the broth microdilution methods recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards).   results a total of 3,134 aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli were isolated. enterobacteriaceae accounted for 82% of the total and were most consistently susceptible to amikacin and the carbapenems. escherichia coli (45%) and klebsiella spp. (17%) were the most common species. the susceptibility rates of these organisms to the 12 antimicrobial agents differed among geographic regions, with isolates from the asia/pacific and latin american regions usually having the highest rates of resistance. ampicillin/sulbactam was the agent least frequently active against e. coli (56% susceptible) and klebsiella spp. (73% susceptible). extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were detected phenotypically in 7% of e. coli, 13% of klebsiella spp., and 18% of enterobacter spp. producers of esbl overall had a more antibiotic-resistant profile than non-producers but were usually susceptible to carbapenems.   conclusions antimicrobial resistance rates among gram-negative bacilli isolated from intra-abdominal infections differed among geographic regions. the carbapenems were consistently active in vitro against enterobacteriaceae worldwide, including esbl producers.
backgroundobtaining patient satisfaction is a key goal of surgical treatment. it was the purpose of this study to identify pre-, peri- and postoperative factors determining patient satisfaction after shoulder surgery, quantify their relative importance and thereby allow the surgeon to focus on parameters, which will influence patient satisfaction.methodswe retrospectively reviewed 505 patients, who underwent either rotator cuff repair (n = 216) or total shoulder arthroplasty (n = 289). we examined 21 patient-specific and socio-demographic parameters as well as 31 values of the constant-score with regard to their impact on patient satisfaction.resultsin the univariable analysis higher patient satisfaction was correlated with higher age, private health insurance, light physical work, retirement, primary surgery, non-smoking, absence of chronic alcohol abuse, absence of peri- or postoperative complications, operation performed by the medical director as well as various constant score sub-values (p < 0.05). in the multivariable analysis absence of peri- or postoperative complications (p = 0.008), little postoperative pain (p = 0.0001), a large range of postoperative active abduction (p = 0.05) and a high postoperative subjective shoulder value (p = 0.0001) were identified as independent prognostic factors for high satisfaction.conclusionafter reconstructive shoulder surgery particular attention should be paid to prevention of complications, excellent perioperative pain control and restoration of abduction during rehabilitation. this study is first step towards a preoperative prediction model of a subjectively successful surgery as well as a tool to exclude irrelevant parameters in clinical routine. the purpose of this investigation was to identify the determinants of patient satisfaction with outcome after hemiarthroplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty. seventy patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty were studied to determine predictors of patient satisfaction. patient satisfaction was graded on an ordinal scale from 1 to 10. there was a significant association between patient satisfaction and age (p = .010) and between patient satisfaction and worker's compensation status (p = .018). there was no significant decrease in patient satisfaction for patients with rotator cuff tears. patient satisfaction was significantly associated with all pain and function variables at follow-up (p < .05). the american shoulder and elbow surgeons score was significantly correlated with patient satisfaction (p = 0.680, p < .05). independent predictors of satisfaction included pain with activities of daily living, painless use of the arm above the shoulder, and difficulty with toileting (r(2) = 0.555). subjective variables associated with pain were independent predictors of patient satisfaction. thus, in assessing patient satisfaction after shoulder arthroplasty, we emphasize the importance of patient-derived subjective assessment of symptoms and function.
eight new chromones, engyodontiumones a–h (1–8), and three new phenol derivatives (9–11) together with eight known polyketides (12–19) were isolated from the deep-sea-derived fungus engyodontium album dffscs021. their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic analysis. compounds 8 and 16 showed significant selective cytotoxicity against human histiocytic lymphoma u937 cell line with ic50 values of 4.9 and 8.8 μm, respectively. in addition, this is the first time to report that 8, 15 and 16 had mild antibacterial activity against escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, and 15 showed potent antilarval activity against barnacle balanus amphitrite larval settlement. three new sesquiterpenes, named aspergillusenes a and b and (+)-(7s)-7-o-methylsydonic acid, and two new hydrogenated xanthone derivatives, named aspergillusones a and b, were isolated from the sea fan-derived fungus aspergillus sydowii psu-f154 together with 10 known compounds. their structures were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data. the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activity.
objective:the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of apoptosis in human fulminant hepatic failure. we studied the expression of fas antigen on liver tissues, fas ligand in lymphocytes, and soluble fas ligand in patients' serum.methods:on finding apoptotic cells in fulminant hepatic failure liver, we first examined them using the tunel method. subsequently, the expression of fas was studied by immunostaining. simultaneously, fas ligand presenting on both liver-infiltrated cells and peripheral lymphocytes was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and soluble fas ligand in sera was measured by elisa.results:by using the tunel method, we first demonstrated that many apoptotic cells existed in fulminant hepatic failure but not in normal ones. our immunohistochemistry study showed that many hepatocytes in fulminant hepatic failure strongly expressed fas. in addition, fas ligand on both liver-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral lymphocytes in fulminant hepatic failure patients was detected. the serum level of soluble fas ligand was significantly increased in fulminant hepatic failure (mean value, 2.91 ng/ml in fulminant hepatic failure [n = 10], 1.62 ng/ml in acute hepatitis [n = 10], and 0.27 ng/ml in healthy controls [n = 10]). furthermore, this serum level of sfas ligand was significantly associated with prothrombin time both in acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.conclusions:the present results indicate that fas-mediated apoptosis may be one of the triggers for the induction of fulminant hepatic failure. nature 364, 806-809 (1993) during the production process, a line of text in this letter was accidentally omitted. the fourth sentence of the last paragraph should read, "the liver showed gross injury by administration of the anti-fas antibody and acute hepatic failure seems to be responsible for thedeath of mice, although we cannot rule out lethal damage in tissues such as heart and lung.
purposeto quantify blastocyst morphologic parameters with a feasible and standardized tool, investigating their predictive value on implantation outcome.methodthe study retrospectively analyzes 124 blastocysts from 75 patients. quantitative measurements of blastocyst expansion, inner cell mass and trophoectoderm were taken using digital image analysis software.result(s)blastocysts areas were found to be ranging from 11626.2 up to 35076.4 μm2. the area of an early blastocyst is a ≤ 18500 μm2 with a mean diameter d = 140 ± 9 μm, and the area of an expanded blastocyst is a ≥ 24000 with d = 190 ± 9 μm. while blastocyst mean area was not related to implantation rate, more expanded blastocysts displayed a significantly higher implantation rate. trophoectoderm cell number is a predictor of positive outcome: since a higher of cells (25.6 ± 11.3 vs 16.3 ± 12.8) `forming a tightly knit epithelium is prognostic of implantation potential. conversely, inner cell mass size is significantly related to implantation only in expanded blastocysts (3122.7 ± 739.0 vs. 2978.1 ± 366.0 μm2).conclusion(s)evaluation of blastocyst morphology with a digital image system could be a valuable tool to standardize blastocyst grading based on quantitative parameters. therefore, digital analysis may be helpful in identifying the best blastocyst to transfer. objective to investigate the predictive value of quantitative measurements of blastocyst morphology on subsequent implantation rates after transfer.   design prospective observational study.   setting private assisted reproductive technology center.   patient(s) one hundred seventy-four ivf patients receiving transfers of expanded blastocyst-stage embryos on day 5 (n = 112) or day 6 (n = 62) after oocyte retrieval.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) blastocyst diameter, number of trophectoderm cells, inner cell mass (icm) size, icm shape, and implantation and pregnancy rates.   result(s) blastocyst diameter and trophectoderm cell numbers were unrelated to implantation rates. day 5 expanded blastocysts with icms of >4,500 microm(2) implanted at a higher rate than did those with smaller icms (55% vs. 31%). day 5 expanded blastocysts with slightly oval icms implanted at a higher rate (58%) compared with those with either rounder icms (7%) or more elongated icms (33%). implantation rates were highest (71%) for embryos with both optimal icm size and shape. pregnancy rates were higher for day 5 transfers of optimally shaped icms compared with day 5 transfers of optimally sized icms.   conclusion(s) quantitative measurements of the inner cell mass are highly indicative of blastocyst implantation potential. blastocysts with relatively large and/or slightly oval icms are more likely to implant than other blastocysts.
bacterial dna contamination of rust fungal dna can be a significant problem for sequencing the rust fungus. sequence assembly is much more difficult if the sequence contigs are mixed with bacterial sequence. a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay was developed to quantify bacterial dna within rust fungal dna samples and the results were compared with those obtained from traditional cfu counts. real-time pcr showed higher values of dna contamination than cfu. however, the ranking of samples from low to high for bacterial contamination was consistent between the methods. reasons for the differences between the methods are discussed. the qpcr assay was tested by adding known quantities of escherichia coli dna to puccinia graminis dna samples. the assay reliably quantified bacterial contamination at > or = 1.0% of the total sample dna. when bacterial contamination was <1.0%, fungal dna also occasionally was amplified, nullifying the quantification measurement. however, primer specificity was not simply the product of the ratio of bacterial dna to fungal dna. bacterial contamination could be quantified below 1.0% if the bacterial dna concentration was approximately 70 pg/mul or greater. therefore, spiking the fungal samples with a known concentration of e. coli bacterial dna successfully eliminated the amplification of fungal dna, making quantification of contaminating bacterial dna possible for samples with low contamination levels. jejunum digesta samples were taken from weaning pigs in order to evaluate real-time pcr (qpcr) as a method for quantifying pig gut bacteria. total bacteria, lactobacilli and enterobacteria were quantified by qpcr and the results were compared with those obtained with traditional methods: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi staining) for total bacteria, selective culture for lactobacilli and enterobacteria. real-time pcr showed higher values in terms of 16s rrna gene copies than dapi counts or cfu. despite the differences, the lactobacilli:enterobacteria ratio was similar between methods (2.5 +/- 0.58 for qpcr and 3.1 +/- 0.71 for selective culture, p = 0.39). possible reasons for the higher pcr counts are discussed considering both an overestimation with pcr by quantification of dead bacteria or free dna and also an underestimation with conventional methods. inherent differences in the pre-treatment of the samples could partially explain the discrepancies observed. regardless of the numerical differences between methods, values obtained by qpcr and traditional methods showed a significant correlation for lactobacilli and total bacteria. in the light of these results, real-time pcr seems a valid method to quantify microbial shifts in the gastrointestinal tract.
procarcinogen-activating cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes such as cyp1b1, cyp1a1, and cyp1a2 are considered to play an important role in chemical carcinogenesis. however, conflicting data exist with respect to cyp1b1 expression in human liver. in the present study, we measured cyp1b1 mrna and protein expression in liver samples from 12 individuals (7 nonsmokers, 4 smokers, and 1 ex-smoker) and compared the levels to those of cyp1a1 and cyp1a2. as analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, cyp1b1 mrna was present in all samples and the inter-individual variability was 16-fold. the group mean level was 5-fold greater in smokers than nonsmokers (121 +/- 46 vs. 26 +/- 5 molecules/ng double-stranded dna, p < 0.05). by comparison, cyp1a1 mrna was detectable in samples from 4 of 7 nonsmokers, 3 of 4 smokers, and one ex-smoker, whereas cyp1a2 mrna was detectable in samples from 5 nonsmokers, 4 smokers, and the ex-smoker. the mean levels of cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 mrna were 4-fold and 9-fold greater, respectively, in smokers than nonsmokers, but the differences were not statistically significant. the inter-individual variability in cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 mrna expression was 26-fold and 500-fold, respectively. immunoblot analysis using several antibodies and with a larger panel (n = 27) of liver microsomes showed that cyp1a1 and cyp1b1 proteins were undetectable, whereas cyp1a2 was detectable in all samples and quantifiable in 24 of 27 samples. in summary, our novel finding indicates that cyp1b1 mrna is expressed in human liver and the levels are increased in smokers, but the protein is undetectable. immunoblot analysis of human livers using a monospecific antibody to rat cyp1a2 section demonstrated that the expression of cyp1a2 protein is highly variable in human liver. quantitative pcr analysis was then employed to examine the interindividual variability of both cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 mrnas in human liver. hepatic content of cyp1a2 mrna correlated significantly with levels of cyp1a2 protein as analysed by immunoblot analysis (r = 0.58; p < 0.01). cyp1a2 mrna content varied > 40-fold among individuals while cyp1a1 content varied > 20-fold. cyp1a2 mrna was higher than cyp1a1 mrna (approximately two to 30-fold) in livers of different individuals. the individual with the highest cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 mrna amounts was a current smoker, but mrna expression in two other smokers was within the range observed among nonsmokers. the expression of the two cyp1a mrnas correlated highly (r = 0.72; p < 0.0005) when smokers were included, but the correlation was less significant (r = 0.62; p < 0.05) in nonsmokers. we amplified a full-length cyp1a2 cdna clone by pcr from a liver which expressed extremely low amounts of cyp1a2 protein. sequence analysis indicated that exon 4 was missing in this clone, but no other sequence changes were found. pcr analysis demonstrated that both the normally spliced mrna and abnormally spliced mrna could be detected in all human livers examined, but the normally spliced mrna was more abundant than the splice variant. therefore, sequence changes in the coding region of cyp1a2 did not account for the poor expression of cyp1a2 in this individual.
geographical subspecies of wild silkmoths, samia cynthia ssp. (lepidoptera: saturniidae), differ considerably in sex chromosome constitution owing to sex chromosome fusions with autosomes, which leads to variation in chromosome numbers. we cloned s. cynthia orthologues of 16 bombyx mori genes and mapped them to chromosome spreads of s. cynthia subspecies by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) to determine the origin of s. cynthia neo-sex chromosomes. fish mapping revealed that the z chromosome and chromosome 12 of b. mori correspond to the z chromosome and an autosome (a1) of s. c. ricini (vietnam population, 2n=27, z0 in female moths), respectively. b. mori chromosome 11 corresponds partly to another autosome (a2) and partly to a chromosome carrying nucleolar organizer region (nor) of this subspecies. the nor chromosome of s. c. ricini is also partly homologous to b. mori chromosome 24. furthermore, our results revealed that two a1 homologues each fused with the w and z chromosomes in a common ancestor of both japanese subspecies s. c. walkeri (sapporo population, 2n=26, neo-wneo-z) and s. cynthia subsp. indet. (nagano population, 2n=25, neo-wz1z2). one homologue, corresponding to the a2 autosome in s. c. ricini and s. c. walkeri, fused with the w chromosome in s. cynthia subsp. indet. consequently, the other homologue became a z2 chromosome. these results clearly showed a step-by-step evolution of the neo-sex chromosomes by repeated autosome–sex chromosome fusions. we suggest that the rearrangements of sex chromosomes may facilitate divergence of s. cynthia subspecies towards speciation. backgroundrecent translocations of autosomal regions to the sex chromosomes represent important systems for identifying the evolutionary forces affecting convergent patterns of sex-chromosome heteromorphism. additions to the sex chromosomes have been reported in the melanica and robusta species groups, two sister clades of drosophila. the close relationship between these two species groups and the similarity of their rearranged karyotypes motivates this test of alternative hypotheses; the rearranged sex chromosomes in both groups are derived through a common origin, or the rearrangements are derived through at least two independent origins. here we examine chromosomal arrangement in representatives of the melanica and the robusta species groups and test these alternative hypotheses using a phylogenetic approach.resultstwo mitochondrial and two nuclear gene sequences were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of a set of nine ingroup species having fused and unfused sex chromosomes and representing a broad sample of both species groups. different methods of phylogenetic inference, coupled with concurrent cytogenetic analysis, indicate that the hypothesis of independent origins of rearranged sex chromosomes within each species group is significantly more likely than the alternative hypothesis of a single common origin. an estimate tightly constrained around 8 my was obtained for the age of the rearranged sex chromosomes in the melanica group; however, a more loosely constrained estimate of 10–15 my was obtained for the age of the rearrangement in the robusta group.conclusionindependent acquisition of new chromosomal arms by the sex chromosomes in the melanica and robusta species groups represents a case of striking convergence at the karyotypic level. our findings indicate that the parallel divergence experienced by newly sex-linked genomic regions in these groups represents an excellent system for studying the tempo of sex chromosome evolution.
purpose: to assess whether bisphenol a contamination occurred in seven brands of bottled drinking water in riyadh, saudi arabia. methods: liquid-liquid extraction (using dichloromethane) was used to analytically extract bisphenol a from drinking water bottles and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer was employed for its detection using a splitless capillary column and helium as the carrier gas. results: the concentration of bisphenol a (bpa) was high in all the bottled water brands tested. the mean concentration of bpa of the bottled water stored indoors (4.03 ng/l) was significantly lower than that stored outdoors (7.5 ng/l). conclusion: our results show that significant amounts of bpa leached from bottle containers into the water. long storage of bottled water under direct sunlight should be avoided to reduce the risk of human exposure to bpa. the aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of endocrine disrupting compounds (edcs) in bottled waters. the examined compounds were bisphenol a (bpa), nonylphenol (np), tert-octylphenol (top), dimethyl phthalate (dmp), diethyl phthalate (dep), di-n-butyl phthalate (dbp), butyl benzyl phthalate (bbp), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (dehp) and di(n-octyl)phthalate (dnop). the presence of edcs in bottled waters under poor storage conditions was also investigated after exposure outdoors under realistic conditions for 15 and 30 days. edcs were recovered after liquid-liquid extraction and determined by employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. most of these compounds were detected in bottled water from different brands purchased from local market. storage at outdoor conditions had no significant effect on the concentrations of the examined compounds. only bpa occurred at higher concentrations in polycarbonate containers exhibited an increasing trend during exposure. the estimated exposure to edcs via consumption of drinking water was very low.
interleukin-21 (il-21) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). the aim of our study was to assess serum levels of il-21 in patients with recent-onset ra in relation to disease activity and response to treatment. we analyzed serum levels of il-21 in 51 ra patients, both before and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment and in 36 healthy individuals. disease activity was assessed at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24 using the disease activity score for 28 joints, serum levels of c-reactive protein, and the total swollen joint count. we found that il-21 levels were not increased in patients with recent-onset ra compared with healthy controls, but they had significantly decreased from baseline to week 12 during treatment. baseline levels of il-21 significantly correlated with measures of disease activity (p<0.02 for all). although il-21 levels did not predict achievement of remission, decrease in il-21 levels correlated with improvement in disease activity after 12 weeks (p<0.02) and also after 24 weeks (p<0.04) of treatment. our data suggest that circulating il-21 levels may serve as a biomarker of disease activity and better outcome in early phase of ra. objective. to investigate the levels of the t helper (th)17-related cytokines interleukin 17a (il-17a), il-21, and il-23 and their association with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods. in a longitudinal sample set from patients with early ra (< 6 months; n = 40), we measured the plasma cytokine levels of il-17a, il-21, and il-23 and analyzed for correlation with disease activity in 28 joints (disease activity score 28-joint count; das28), c-reactive protein (crp), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), and total sharp score (tss). in a transverse sample set of patients with chronic ra (> 8 years), using paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells, we investigated the cellular expression of il-17a, il-21, and il-23r. results. patients with early-stage ra had significantly increased plasma levels of il-21 and il-23, but not il-17a, compared to patients with chronic ra and healthy volunteer controls. plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 after 12 months of treatment correlated with das28 and esr, but not to tss. changes in il-23 plasma levels from time of diagnosis to 12 months correlated with change in das28 and with tss scores at 2 years. the numbers of cd4+ t cells producing il-21 were significantly increased in the synovial fluid of patients with chronic ra, with only marginal coexpression of il-21 and il-17a. conclusion. our results show a significant association between plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 and disease activity in ra, supporting the hypothesis that il-21 and il-23 are important pathogenic factors of this disease.
maturation of the fetal hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenocortical (hpa) axis is critical for organ maturation necessary for the fetus to transition to the ex‐utero environment. intrauterine stressors can hasten maturation of the hpa axis leading to fetal growth restriction and in sheep, premature birth. we have previously reported that high‐altitude mediated, long‐term‐moderate gestational hypoxia (lth) during gestation has a significant impact on the fetal hpa axis. significant effects were observed at the level of both the anterior pituitary and adrenal cortex resulting in elevated plasma acth during late gestation with decreased adrenocortical expression of enzymes rate limiting for cortisol synthesis. as such, these fetuses exhibited the normal ontogenic rise in fetal plasma cortisol but an exaggerated cortisol response to acute stress. this study extended these findings to acth secretagogue expression in the pvn using in situ hybridization. we report that the expression of avp but not crh was increased in the medial parvocellular pvn (mppvn) in the lth fetus. this represented an increase in both avp mrna per neuron as well as an increase in avp hybridizing neurons with no increase in mppvn crh neurons. lth had no effect on pvn volume, area of crh or avp hybridization, thus lth did not have a trophic effect on the size of the nucleus. in conclusion, there appears to be a switch from crh to avp as a primary acth secretagogue in response to lth, supporting our previous findings of increased anterior pituitary sensitivity to avp over crh in the lth fetus. we previously communicated that long-term hypoxia (lth) resulted in a selective reduction in plasma epinephrine following acute stress in fetal sheep. the present study tested the hypothesis that lth selectively reduces adrenomedullary expression of phenylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase (pnmt), the rate-limiting enzyme for epinephrine synthesis. we also examined the effect of lth on adrenomedullary nicotinic, muscarinic, and glucocorticoid receptor (gr) expression. ewes were maintained at high altitude (3,820 m) from 30 to 138 days gestation (dga); adrenomedullary tissue was collected from lth and age-matched, normoxic control fetuses at 139-141 dga. contrary to our hypothesis, in addition to pnmt, adrenomedullary expression (mrna, protein) of tyrosine hydroxylase (th) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh) were reduced in the lth fetus. immunocytochemistry indicated that th and dbh expression was lower throughout the medulla, while pnmt appeared to reflect a reduction in pnmt-expressing cells. nicotinic receptor alpha 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, beta 1, 2, and 4 subunits were expressed in the medulla of lth and control fetuses. messenger rna for alpha 1 and 7 and beta 1 and 2 subunits was lower in lth fetuses. muscarinic receptors m1, m2, and m3 as well as the gr were also expressed, and no differences were noted between groups. in summary, lth in fetal sheep has a profound effect on expression of key enzymes mediating adrenomedullary catecholamine synthesis. further, lth impacts nicotinic receptor subunit expression potentially altering cholinergic neurotransmission within the medulla. these findings have important implications regarding fetal cardiovascular and metabolic responses to stress in the lth fetus.
purpose this study focuses on stop voicing differentiation in bilingual children with normal hearing (nh) and their bilingual peers with hearing loss who use cochlear implants (cis).   method twenty-two bilingual children participated in our study (11 with nh, m age = 5;1 [years;months], and 11 with cis, m hearing age = 5;1). the groups were matched on hearing age and a range of demographic variables. single-word picture elicitation was used with word-initial singleton stop consonants. repeated measures analyses of variance with three within-subject factors (language, stop voicing, and stop place of articulation) and one between-subjects factor (nh vs. ci user) were conducted with voice onset time and percentage of prevoiced stops as dependent variables.   results main effects were statistically significant for language, stop voicing, and stop place of articulation on both voice onset time and prevoicing. there were no significant main effects for nh versus ci groups. both children with nh and with cis differentiated stop voicing in their languages and by stop place of articulation. stop voicing differentiation was commensurate across the groups of children with nh versus cis.   conclusions stop voicing differentiation is accomplished in a similar fashion by bilingual children with nh and cis, and both groups differentiate stop voicing in a language-specific fashion. purpose common wisdom suggests that listening in noise poses disproportionately greater difficulty for listeners with cochlear implants (cis) than for peers with normal hearing (nh). the purpose of this study was to examine phonological, language, and cognitive skills that might help explain speech-in-noise abilities for children with cis.   method three groups of kindergartners (nh, hearing aid wearers, and ci users) were tested on speech recognition in quiet and noise and on tasks thought to underlie the abilities that fit into the domains of phonological awareness, general language, and cognitive skills. these last measures were used as predictor variables in regression analyses with speech-in-noise scores as dependent variables.   results compared to children with nh, children with cis did not perform as well on speech recognition in noise or on most other measures, including recognition in quiet. two surprising results were that (a) noise effects were consistent across groups and (b) scores on other measures did not explain any group differences in speech recognition.   conclusions limitations of implant processing take their primary toll on recognition in quiet and account for poor speech recognition and language/phonological deficits in children with cis. implications are that teachers/clinicians need to teach language/phonology directly and maximize signal-to-noise levels in the classroom.
this is the first known large-scale molecular study of simple sequence repeats (ssr) loci based on samples from grafted trees found in the iberian peninsula and canary islands and hybrids. interspecific hybrids resistant to ‘ink disease’ (phytophthora spp.) were obtained in france, portugal and spain, although difficult to distinguish by morphology. this study focuses on genetic variation using 10 ssrs (11 unlinked loci) from clonally propagated cultivars (574 accessions) of european chestnut (castanea sativa) and hybrids (71 accessions). they were compared with a representative sample of exotic chestnut species present in the atlantic area, 47 accessions of castanea crenata, 37 of castanea mollissima and 33 of castanea henryi. accessions were analysed using a model-based bayesian procedure (structure), factorial correspondence analysis and analysis of molecular variance. the main chestnut species, hybrids and alien introgressions were differentiated. two main origins of variability in european cultivated chestnut were found in the iberian peninsula, one in the north and a second in the centre. andalusian and canary island accessions could be assigned to both of these zones, which indicate that they could have been colonised with cultivars originating from either zone, in the case of the canary islands from the sixteenth century on. allozyme genetic variability in three chestnut (castanea) species was investigated using 19 loci from ten enzyme systems. g-tests of heterogeneity of isozymic allele distribution showed significant differences between the three species at 15 of the 19 loci, and between the 13 c. mollissima populations at 13 of the 19 loci examined. c. mollissima was found to possess a significantly-higher value of mean gene heterozygosity (h=0.3050±0.0419), the percentage of polymorphic loci (p=84.21%) and the average number of alleles per locus (a=2.05), than any other species in the castanea section eucastanon. when the genetic variability of populations of c. mollissima from four regions in china was investigated, the population from the changjiang river region showed a markedly higher mean gene heterozygosity (h=0.3480±0.0436) than populations from the other regions. genetic relationships among the four regions were assessed by nei's genetic identity i and standard genetic distance d. an approximately-identical distance between the population from the changjiang river region and populations from the three other regions was observed, while populations from the latter regions showed almost the same genetic distance from each other. these data, when considered with information existing prior to this study, contribute to an understanding of the possible origin and progenitor of the chestnut species.
n.o. schiller and a. caramazza (2003) and a. costa, d. kovacic, e. fedorenko, and a. caramazza (2003) have argued that the processing of freestanding gender-marked morphemes (e.g., determiners) and bound gender-marked morphemes (e.g., adjective suffixes) during syntactic encoding in speech production follows distinct principles, with only freestanding morphemes being subject to a competitive selection process. in 3 experiments, the authors tested this hypothesis in german, extending a previous study by h. schriefers, j.d. jescheniak, and a. hantsch (2002). the results suggest that freestanding and bound morphemes are basically processed in the same way, although competition appears to be attenuated for bound morphemes relative to free morphemes. the authors discuss theoretical and methodological implications of this pattern. picture-word interference experiments conducted with italian speakers investigated how determiners are selected in noun phrase (np) production. determiner production involves the selection of a noun's syntactic features (mass or count, gender), which specify the type of determiner to be selected, and the subsequent selection of a particular phonological form (e.g., the/a in english). the research focused on the syntactic feature of gender. results repeatedly failed to replicate the gender-congruity effect in np production reported with dutch speakers (longer latencies for target-distractor noun pairs with contrasting as opposed to the same gender). it is proposed that the discrepant results reflect processing differences in lexical access in italian and dutch: the selection of determiners in italian, but not in dutch, depends on phonological properties of the word that follows it in the np. evidence consistent with this explanation was obtained in an experiment in which determiner selection in np production was hindered by conflicting phonological information in the np.
backgroundfaecal immunochemical tests (fits) are commonly used in colorectal cancer (crc) screening. diagnostic accuracy of fit differs between males and females. this so far unexplained difference could result in a dissimilarity in screening outcome between both sexes. the aim of this study is to compare sensitivity and specificity of a fit between males and females, and study potential explanatory variables.methodsin this cross-sectional study, data were prospectively collected. 3,022 subjects performed a fit prior to complete colonoscopy. sensitivity, specificity, and roc curves were compared for both sexes. potential explanatory variables of the relation between sensitivity and sex were explored.resultsat all cut-off values, fit sensitivity for crc was higher (range 13-23%) and specificity was lower (range 2-4%) in males compared to females. at 75 ng/ml, sensitivity for crc was 93% in males compared to 71% in females (p = 0.03), and specificity was 90% in males compared to 93% in females (p = <0.05). for advanced adenomas, males had a slightly higher sensitivity and lower specificity (not significant). at 75 ng/ml, sensitivity for advanced adenomas was 33% in males compared to 29% in females (p = 0.46), and specificity was 93% in males compared to 95% in females (p = 0.22). roc curves were similar for both sexes, and equal combinations of sensitivity and specificity could be achieved by adjusting the cut-off values. for crc, the difference in sensitivity could not be explained by age or location of the tumour.conclusionsfit has a higher sensitivity and a lower specificity for crc in males than in females. equal test characteristics can be achieved by allowing separate cut-off values for both sexes. location and age do not explain the observed differences in sensitivity. background faecal occult blood tests (fobt) are faulted by low sensitivity for advanced adenomatous polyps (aap). quantified, immunochemical, haemoglobin (hb)‐specific immunochemical fobt (i‐fobt) measurements are now used for colorectal screening.
we investigated the role of micrornas (mirnas) in the pathogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). a genome-wide mirna microarray was used to identify differentially expressed mirnas in hccs arisen on cirrhotic livers. thirty-five mirnas were identified. several of these mirnas were previously found deregulated in other human cancers, such as members of the let-7 family, mir-221, and mir-145. in addition, the hepato-specific mir-122a was found down-regulated in approximately 70% of hccs and in all hcc-derived cell lines. microarray data for let-7a, mir-221, and mir-122a were validated by northern blot and real-time pcr analysis. understanding the contribution of deregulated mirnas to cancer requires the identification of gene targets. here, we show that mir-122a can modulate cyclin g1 expression in hcc-derived cell lines and an inverse correlation between mir-122a and cyclin g1 expression exists in primary liver carcinomas. these results indicate that cyclin g1 is a target of mir-122a and expand our knowledge of the molecular alterations involved in hcc pathogenesis and of the role of mirnas in human cancer. micrornas (mirnas) are an abundant class of non-coding rnas that are believed to be important in many biological processes through regulation of gene expression. the precise molecular function of mirnas in mammals is largely unknown and a better understanding will require loss-of-function studies in vivo. here we show that a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides, termed ‘antagomirs’, are efficient and specific silencers of endogenous mirnas in mice. intravenous administration of antagomirs against mir-16, mir-122, mir-192 and mir-194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding mirna levels in liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals. the silencing of endogenous mirnas by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting. the biological significance of silencing mirnas with the use of antagomirs was studied for mir-122, an abundant liver-specific mirna. gene expression and bioinformatic analysis of messenger rna from antagomir-treated animals revealed that the 3′ untranslated regions of upregulated genes are strongly enriched in mir-122 recognition motifs, whereas downregulated genes are depleted in these motifs. analysis of the functional annotation of downregulated genes specifically predicted that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would be affected by mir-122, and plasma cholesterol measurements showed reduced levels in antagomir-122-treated mice. our findings show that antagomirs are powerful tools to silence specific mirnas in vivo and may represent a therapeutic strategy for silencing mirnas in disease.
background: the communication of empathy is key in physician–patient interactions. we introduced drama training in “how to act-in-role” to medical students and evaluated the effect of this. methods: a quasi-experimental design was employed, with 72 students in the control and 77 students in the intervention group. the students’ empathy scores were obtained using the jefferson scale of physician empathy (jspe) during the introductory course. both groups received tutorials in motivational interviewing and brief intervention skills. the students in the intervention group also received training in “how to act-in-role”. the jspe was repeated for both groups. the students subsequently undertook observed structured clinical examinations (osce). both tutors and students evaluated the student's osce performance as well as their motivational interviewing skills using the behavior change counseling index (becci). results: our findings show that while the students in both groups did not significantly differ in baseline empathy scores, the intervention group reported significantly higher empathy scores post-intervention. the intervention group also received significantly higher tutor ratings for their motivational interviewing (becci score) and overall osce performances. in conclusion, the teaching innovation “how to act-in-role” was effective not only in increasing medical students’ self-reported empathy but also their competence in consultation skills. objective there is a dearth of empirical research on physician empathy despite its mediating role in patient-physician relationships and clinical outcomes. this study was designed to investigate the components of physician empathy, its measurement properties, and group differences in empathy scores.   method a revised version of the jefferson scale of physician empathy (with 20 likert-type items) was mailed to 1,007 physicians affiliated with the jefferson health system in the greater philadelphia region; 704 (70%) responded. construct validity, reliability of the empathy scale, and the differences on mean empathy scores by physicians' gender and specialty were examined.   results three meaningful factors emerged (perspective taking, compassionate care, and standing in the patient's shoes) to provide support for the construct validity of the empathy scale that was also found to be internally consistent with relatively stable scores over time. women scored higher than men to a degree that was nearly significant. with control for gender, psychiatrists scored a mean empathy rating that was significantly higher than that of physicians specializing in anesthesiology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, radiology, cardiovascular surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and general surgery. no significant difference was observed on empathy scores among physicians specializing in psychiatry, internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and family medicine.   conclusions empathy is a multidimensional concept that varies among physicians and can be measured with a psychometrically sound tool. implications for specialty selection and career counseling are discussed.
background and aimscombination of rewetting and wetland crop cultivation (paludiculture) is pursued as a wider carbon dioxide (co2) mitigation option in drained peatland. however, information on the overall greenhouse gas (ghg) balance for paludiculture is lacking. we investigated the ghg balance of peatlands grown with reed canary grass (rcg) and rewetted to various extents.methodsgas fluxes of co2, methane (ch4) and nitrous oxide (n2o) were measured with a static chamber technique for 10 months from mesocosms sown with rcg and manipulated to ground water levels (gwl) of 0, −10, −20, −30 and −40 cm below the soil surface. gross primary production (gpp) was estimated from the above ground biomass yield.resultsthe mean dry biomass yield across all water table treatments was 6 mg ha−1 with no significant differences between the treatments. raising the gwl to the surface decreased both the net ecosystem exchange (nee) of co2 and n2o emissions whereas ch4 emissions increased. total cumulative ghg emissions (for 10 months) corresponded to 0.08, 0.13, 0.61, 0.68 and 0.98 kg co2 equivalents m−2 from the gwl treatments at 0, −10, −20, −30 and −40 cm below the soil surface, respectively.conclusionsthe results showed that a reduction in total ghg emission can be achieved without losing the productivity of newly established rcg when gwl is maintained close to the surface. further studies should address the practical constrains and long-term productivity of rcg cultivation in rewetted peatlands. northern peatland methane (ch4) budgets are important for global ch4 emissions. this study aims to determine the ecosystem ch4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. annually, roughly 70 ± 35% of ecosystem ch4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, p. arundinacea-mediated ch4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. despite of plant-dominant ch4 transport, net ch4 fluxes were low (– 0.005–0.016 μmol m−2 s−1) and annually less than 1% of the annual c-co2 assimilation. this is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased ch4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. this study shows that although ch4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than co2, is emitted from this p. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the c sequestered counterbalances the ch4 emissions to the atmosphere. it is concluded that p. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive c-sequestration ecosystem.
cutaneous melanoma is a common and aggressive human skin cancers. much is actually known about the molecular mechanisms underlying melanoma pathogenesis. the aim of the study was to evaluate any possible correlation between mutations in main growth-controlling genes (braf, nras, cdkn2a) and copy number variations in frequently amplified candidate genes (mitf, egfr, ccnd1, cmet, and ckit) during melanoma initiation and progression. a large series of primary and secondary melanoma tissue samples (n = 274) from 232 consecutively-collected patients of italian origin as well as 32 tumor cell lines derived from primary and metastatic melanomas underwent mutation screening and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis. overall, braf, nras, and cdkn2a were found mutated in 62.5%, 12.5% and 59% cell lines and in 47%, 16%, 12% tumor tissues, respectively. quite identical mutation patterns between primary tumors and metastatic lesions were found for braf and nras genes; mutations of cdkn2a gene appeared to be instead selected during tumor progression. in cell lines, high rates of gene amplifications were observed (varying from 12.5% for ckit to 50% for mitf); vast majority of cell lines (75%) presented at least one amplified gene. conversely, prevalence of gene amplification was significantly and progressively decreasing in melanoma metastases (12%) and primary melanomas (4%). our findings suggest that gene amplifications may be acquired during the late phases of melanoma evolution and mostly act as “passenger” or “non-causative” alterations. considering that nodular melanoma (nm) has the potential to show an early distant metastasis, there is an urgent need for the discovery and evaluation of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. we aimed to investigate the protein expression of membrane and nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), cyclin d1, and the corresponding gene status in nm samples and correlate the results obtained with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival of patients. immunohistochemical and fluorescence in-situ hybridization analyses were carried out on tissue microarrays constructed from 110 nm samples, 30 compound nevi, and 38 dysplastic nevi. nm samples showed 24% strong cyclin d1 and 37% strong ki67 protein expression compared with 3 and 0% strong cyclin d1 and ki67 expression in the control group. membrane egfr expression was detected in 50% of nm cases, whereas egfr gene amplification was detected in only 4% of nm cases. multiple nm samples presented simultaneous membrane and nuclear egfr expression. we found a negative correlation between tumor thickness and membrane egfr expression. it was also observed that membrane egfr 3+ nm samples presented ulceration significantly more often than membrane egfr-negative (0) nm samples. in univariate analysis, carried out on 44 patients with follow-up data, both nuclear and membrane egfr overexpression showed a correlation with a shorter overall survival. nuclear egfr (++, +++) showed 3.06 and membrane egfr (2+, 3+) showed 2.76 higher risk of mortality compared with patients with low and negative nuclear and membrane egfr expression (p<0.05).
the strength-duration function is a classic measure of neural excitability. when studied on peripheral motor axons it reflects the intrinsic nodal membrane properties, and its time-constant (tau(sd) or chronaxie) predominantly depends on non-voltage-gated, rest na(+) inward conductances. we assessed the strength-duration curve of ulnar motor axons in 22 nerves of healthy controls, in 18 nerves of patients with multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction blocks (mmn), and in 19 nerves of patients with motor neurone disease (mnd). the compound muscle action potential (cmap) was smaller in nerves of both groups of patients than in controls (p < 0.05). the rheobasic current (rh(50%)) [mean +/- standard deviation (sd)] was higher in patients with mmn than in controls (13.3 +/- 16.3 ma; controls 4.7 +/- 1.7 ma, p < 0.05). the tau(sd) was differentially abnormal in the nerves of the two groups of patients: it was prolonged in the nerves of patients with mnd for >or=40 years (227.2 +/- 34.5 micro s; controls 190.9 +/- 51.0 micro s, p < 0.05), but it was shortened in the nerves of patients with mmn (146.5 +/- 55.4 micro s; controls 208.6 +/- 51.2 micro s, p < 0.05) who had not been treated recently with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig). nerves of patients with recently treated mmn (<6 weeks) who were under the therapeutic effect of ivig had a normal tau(sd)(.) our results suggest that, probably due to an immuno-mediated rest na(+) channel dysfunction, na(+) conductances are reduced in mmn. this abnormality is a function of the time after the last ivig treatment and involves also the axonal membrane outside the conduction block. conversely, in mnd, possibly owing to the ionic leakage of degenerating membrane, rest na(+) conductances are increased. measuring the strength-duration curve of the ulnar motor axons might be useful in the differential diagnosis between de novo mmn and mnd. the strength-duration time constant (tau sd) is a property of nodal membrane and, while it depends on a number of factors, its measurement may shed light on axonal properties when taken in conjunction with measurements of axonal excitability. for example, tau sd increases with demyelination as the exposed membrane is enlarged by inclusion of paranodal and internodal membrane, it decreases with hyperpolarization and it increases with depolarization. the present study was undertaken in 20 normal volunteers to compare strength-duration curves for compound sensory and muscle action potentials, to determine the most appropriate curve fitting equation for the data, and to examine the reproducibility of the calculated time constant on different days, for potentials of different amplitude and at different sites along the nerve. using a computerized threshold-tracking system, stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce an antidromic compound sensory action potential (csap) or an orthodromic muscle action potential of 30% of maximum. stimulus duration was increased every minute in 20 microseconds steps from 20 microseconds to 1 ms. the time constant for compound sensory potentials (665 +/- 182 microsecond) was longer than that for compound emg potentials (459 +/- 126 microseconds). weiss's formula, which relates threshold charge to stimulus duration, provided an accurate fit for the experimental data, and the study validated that, using it, relatively few experimental measurements were required to calculate the time constant. in repeated studies on the same subject, time constants usually differed by < 400 microseconds for sensory axons and < 250 microseconds for motor axons. they were identical at different sites along the nerve and did not alter with the size of the compound action potential. these characteristics suggest that the determinations of strength-duration time constant could be suitable for clinical usage.
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene mutations are found in most world health organization grade ii and iii gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutations are known to have prognostic value in high-grade gliomas. however, their prognostic significance in low-grade gliomas remains controversial. we determined the predictive and prognostic value of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 status in low-grade gliomas. the association of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 status with clinicopathological and genetic factors was also evaluated. clinical information and genetic data including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation, o 6-methylguanine dna methyltransferase promoter methylation, 1p/19q chromosome loss, and tp53 mutation of 417 low-grade gliomas were collected from the chinese glioma genome atlas database. kaplan–meier and cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic effect of clinical characteristics and molecular biomarkers. isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall, but not progression-free, survival. notably, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation was found to be a significant prognostic factor in patients with oligodendrogliomas, but not in patients with astrocytomas. furthermore, o 6-methylguanine dna methyltransferase promoter methylation (p = 0.017) and tp53 mutation (p < 0.001), but not 1p/19q loss (p = 0.834), occurred at a higher frequency in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-mutated tumors than in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 wild-type tumors. younger patient age (p = 0.041) and frontal lobe location (p = 0.010) were significantly correlated with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation. chemotherapy did not provide a survival benefit in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-mutated tumors. isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation was an independent prognostic factor in low-grade gliomas, whereas it showed no predictive value for chemotherapy response. isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation was highly associated with o 6-methylguanine dna methyltransferase promoter methylation and tp53 mutation. background: mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (idh1 and idh2) have been implicated in tumorigenesis of gliomas. patients with high-grade astrocytomas with idh1 or idh2 mutations were reported to have a better survival, but it is unknown if this improved survival also holds for low-grade astrocytoma and whether these mutations predict outcome to specific treatment. methods: we retrospectively investigated the correlation of idh1 and idh2 mutations with overall survival and response to temozolomide in a cohort of patients with dedifferentiated low-grade astrocytomas treated with temozolomide at the time of progression after radiotherapy. results: idh1 mutations were present in 86% of the 49 progressive astrocytomas. no mutations in idh2 were found. presence of idh1 mutations were early events and significantly improved overall survival (median survival 48 vs 98 months), but did not affect outcome of temozolomide treatment. conclusion: these results indicate that idh1 mutations identify a subgroup of gliomas with an improved survival, but are unrelated to the temozolomide response.
the formation of enduring internal representation of sensory information demands, in many cases, convergence in time and space of two different stimuli. the first conveys the sensory input, mediated via fast neurotransmission. the second conveys the meaning of the input, hypothesized to be mediated via slow neurotransmission. we tested the biochemical conditions and feasibility for fast (nmda) and slow (dopamine) neurotransmission to converge on the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathways, crucial in several forms of synaptic plasticity, and recorded its effects upon synaptic transmission. we detected differing kinetics of erk2 activation and synaptic strength changes in the ca1 for low and high doses of neurotransmitters in hippocampal slices. moreover, when weak fast and slow inputs are given together, they converge on erk2, but not on p38 or jnk, and induce strong short-term synaptic depression. surprisingly, pharmacological analysis revealed that a probable site of such convergence is the nmda receptor itself, suggesting it serves as a detector and integrator of fast and slow neurotransmission in the mature mammalian brain, as revealed by erk2 activation and synaptic function. both acute and chronic changes in ampa receptor (ampar) localization are critical for synaptic formation, maturation, and plasticity. here i report that ampars are differentially sorted between recycling and degradative pathways following endocytosis. ampar sorting occurs in early endosomes and is regulated by synaptic activity and activation of ampa and nmda receptors. ampar intemalization triggered by nmdar activation is ca2+-dependent, requires protein phosphatases, and is followed by rapid membrane reinsertion. furthermore, nmdar-mediated ampar trafficking is regulated by pka and accompanied by dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation of glur1 subunits at a pka site. in contrast, activation of ampars without nmdar activation targets ampars to late endosomes and lysosomes, independent of ca2+, protein phosphatases, or pka. these results demonstrate that activity regulates ampar endocytic sorting, providing a potential mechanistic link between rapid and chronic changes in synaptic strength.
stochastic differential equations with poisson driven jumps of random magnitude are popular as models in mathematical finance. strong, or pathwise, simulation of these models is required in various settings and long time stability is desirable to control error growth. here, we examine strong convergence and mean-square stability of a class of implicit numerical methods, proving both positive and negative results. the analysis is backed up with numerical experiments. a class of implicit methods is introduced for ito stochastic differential equations with poisson-driven jumps. a convergence proof shows that these implicit methods share the same finite time strong convergence rate as the explicit euler–maruyama scheme. a mean-square linear stability analysis shows that implicitness offers benefits, and a natural analogue of mean-square a-stability is studied. weak variants are also considered and their stability analyzed.
backgroundwhether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is a risk factor for gallstones remains uncertain. few longitudinal or cohort studies have been used to identify this relationship. the aim of this study was to confirm the association between nafld and gallstones in a longitudinal cohort of urban dwellers in china.methodsto elucidate the association between nafld and gallstones, we fitted a generalized estimating equation (gee) model in a large-scale longitudinal cohort over 6 years, which included 11,200 participants with at least three regular health check-ups.resultsa total of 498 cases of gallstones occurred during the 6-year follow-up, which resulted in a total incidence density of 12.73 per 1000 person-years (498/39, 135.5 person-years). the gee analyses confirmed and clarified the association between nafld and gallstones (relative risk (rr) = 1.2381, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.003–1.528, p = 0.047) after adjusting for other potential confounding factors, especially in females (rr = 1.707, 95% ci = 1.245–2.341, p = 0.001).conclusionsnafld is associated with gallstones in an urban chinese population from the middle to upper socioeconomic strata. moreover, this association is more strongly apparent in females than in males. further cohort studies must be conducted to confirm this association in the general population. background:  insulin resistance is a risk factors for non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) and for gallstone disease (gd). aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with gd in unselected patients with nafld.
brain ischaemia (stroke) triggers an intense inflammatory response predominately mediated by the accumulation of inflammatory cells and mediators in the ischaemic brain. in this context, regulatory t (treg) cells, a subpopulation of cd4+ t cells with immunosuppressive and anti‐inflammatory properties, are activated in the late stages of the disease. to date, the potential therapeutic usefulness of treg cells has not been tested. in this study, we aimed to investigate whether treg cells exert protection/repair following stroke. both the adoptive transfer of treg cells into ischaemic rats and the stimulation of endogenous t‐cell proliferation using a cd28 superagonist reduced the infarct size at 3–28 days following the ischaemic insult. moreover, t cell‐treated animals had higher levels of foxp3 and lower levels of il‐1β, cd11b+ and cd68+ cells in the infarcted hemisphere when compared with control animals. however, t‐cell treatment did not alter the rate of proliferation of neun‐, ncam‐ or cd31‐positive cells, thereby ruling out neurogenesis and angiogenesis in protection. these results suggest that adoptive transfer of t cells is a promising therapeutic strategy against the neurological consequences of stroke. background— cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes are key regulators of postischemic neovascularization. t-cell activation is promoted by 2 major costimulatory signalings, the b7/cd28 and cd40–cd40 ligand pathways. interestingly, cd28 interactions with the structurally related ligands b7-1 and b7-2 are also required for the generation and homeostasis of cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells (treg cells), which play a critical role in the suppression of immune responses and the control of t-cell homeostasis. we hypothesized that treg cell activation may modulate the immunoinflammatory response to ischemic injury, leading to alteration of postischemic vessel growth. methods and results— ischemia was induced by right femoral artery ligation in cd28-, b7-1/2–, or cd40-deficient mice (n=10 per group). cd40 deficiency led to a significant reduction in the postischemic inflammatory response and vessel growth. in contrast, at day 21 after ischemia, angiographic score, foot perfusion, and capillary density were increased by 2.0-, 1.2-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, in cd28-deficient mice, which showed a profound reduction in the number of treg cells compared with controls. similarly, disruption of b7-1/2 signaling or anti-cd25 treatment and subsequent treg deletion significantly enhanced postischemic neovascularization. these effects were associated with enhanced accumulation of cd3-positive t cells and mac-3–positive macrophages in the ischemic leg. conversely, treatment of cd28−/− mice with the nonmitogenic anti-cd3 monoclonal antibody enhanced the number of endogenous treg cells and led to a significant reduction of the postischemic inflammatory response and neovascularization. finally, coadministration of treg cells and cd28−/− splenocytes in rag1−/− mice with hindlimb ischemia abrogated the cd28−/− splenocyte-induced activation of the inflammatory response and neovascularization. conclusion— treg cell response modulates postischemic neovascularization.
daytime napping offers various benefits for healthy adults, including enhancement of motor skill learning. it remains controversial whether napping can provide the same enhancement as overnight sleep, and if so, whether the same neural underpinning is recruited. to investigate this issue, we conducted functional mri during motor skill learning, before and after a short day-nap, in 13 participants, and compared them with a larger group (n=47) who were tested following regular overnight sleep. training in a sequential finger-tapping task required participants to press a keyboard in the mri scanner with their non-dominant left hand as quickly and accurately as possible. the nap group slept for 60min in the scanner after the training run, and the previously trained skill was subsequently re-tested. the whole-night sleep group went home after the training, and was tested the next day. offline improvement of speed was observed in both groups, whereas accuracy was significantly improved only in the whole-night sleep group. correspondingly, the offline increment in task-related activation was significant in the putamen of the whole-night group. this finding reveals a qualitative difference in the offline improvement effect between daytime napping and overnight sleep. growing evidence indicates a role for sleep in off-line memory processing, specifically in post-training consolidation. in humans, sleep has been shown to trigger overnight learning on a motor-sequence memory task, while equivalent waking periods produce no such improvement. but while the behavioral characteristics of sleep-dependent motor learning become increasingly well characterized, the underlying neural basis remains unknown. here we present functional magnetic resonance imaging data demonstrating a change in the representation of a motor memory after a night of sleep. subjects trained on a motor-skill memory and 12 hours later, after either sleep or wake, were retested during functional magnetic resonance imaging. following sleep relative to wake, regions of increased activation were expressed in the right primary motor cortex, medial prefrontal lobe, hippocampus and left cerebellum; changes that can support faster motor output and more precise mapping of key-press movements. in contrast, signal decreases were identified in parietal cortices, the left insular cortex, temporal pole and fronto-polar region, reflecting a reduced need for conscious spatial monitoring and a decreased emotional task burden. this evidence of an overnight, systems-level change in the representation of a motor memory holds important implications for acquiring real-life skills and in clinical rehabilitation following brain trauma, such as stroke.
in kenya, selection of dams for the national contract mating scheme is based on 305-day lactation milk yield (tmy) performance across parities. at farm level, only cows that had good tmy performance in previous parity are retained for the subsequent lactation. this strategy has resulted in improved milk production performance, although increased incidences of physiological disorders, mastitis and reduced fertility have been reported in high-yielding cows. records on functional traits relative to milk yield are scant. properties of lactation curves could be used indirectly to explain the productive and functional efficiency of dairy cows. this study assesses the relationship between lactation traits, based on the lactation curve, to evaluate the effects of selection for tmy on lactation curve properties and to assess the effects of selection decisions based on first lactation on performance in later lactations. a repeatability analysis revealed negative genetic correlations between peak milk yield (mymax) and persistency (s); mymax and days in milk at peak (dimp); and tmy and dimp. genetic correlations were positive between dimp and s, and tmy and mymax. this implies that selection for high tmy would result in high mymax and a reduction in dimp. this alters the shape of the lactation curve, shifting production pressure to early lactation, which aggravates a negative energy balance, thus compromising the physiological integrity of the cow. continuous selection for high tmy could be responsible for the reported decline in reproductive efficiency and lactation physiology. correlation estimates between traits in different parities were bidirectional (correlation estimates changed signs (+/-) in different parities), implying that selection decisions made in lactation 1 may not have similar outcomes in lactations 2 and 3. selection at farm level should be optimised by using records from three parities, as is done in the contract mating scheme. the objective of this study was to investigate the phenotypic relationship between common health disorders in dairy cows and lactation persistency, uncorrelated with 305-d yield. the relationships with peak yield and days in milk (dim) at peak were also studied. daily milk weights and treatment incidence records of 991 holstein lactations from experimental dairy herds at virginia tech and pennsylvania state university were used. persistency was calculated as a function of daily yield deviations from standard lactation curves, developed separately for first (fl) and later lactations (ll), and deviations of dim around reference dates: 128 for fl and 125 for ll. days in milk at peak and peak yield were computed for each lactation by using wood's function. the disease traits studied were mastitis (mast) only during the first 100 d (mast1), only after 100 dim (mast2), both before and after 100 dim (mast12), and at any stage of lactation (mast1/2), as well as metritis, displaced abomasums, lameness, and metabolic diseases. each disease was defined as a binary trait, distinguishing between lactations with at least one incidence (1) and lactations with no incidences (0). the relationships of diseases to persistency, dim at peak, and peak yield were investigated separately for fl and ll for all disease traits except mast12, which was investigated across parities. the relationships of persistency to probability of the diseases in the same lactation and in the next lactation were examined using odds ratios from a logistic regression model. metritis and displaced abomasums in fl and ll were associated with significantly higher persistencies. metabolic diseases and mast1 in ll were significantly related to higher persistencies. the relationships of mast2 in both fl and ll, and mast12 across parities were significant but negative. cows affected by mast tended to have less persistent lactations. most of the diseases had a significant impact on dim at peak in ll. in ll, metritis, metabolic diseases, and displaced abomasums tended to significantly delay dim at peak. mastitis only after 100 dim was associated with significantly earlier dim at peak in ll. increasing persistency was associated with low mast2 and mast1/2 in primiparous cows. none of the diseases studied was significantly related to persistency of the previous lactation.
illicit drug use during pregnancy is a serious social and public health problem inflicting an array of deleterious effects on both mother and offspring. we investigated the hypothesis that a murine anti-phencyclidine (pcp) monoclonal antibody (mab6b5; k(d)=1.3 nm) can safely protect mother and fetus from pcp-induced adverse health effects in pregnant rats. pregnant sprague-dawley rats (n=4-5) were intravenously administered bolus injections of pcp (1mg/kg) on multiple days during pregnancy. they were also chronically treated with anti-pcp mab6b5 at 45 mg/kg as a pcp antagonist. this dose provided one mab-pcp binding site for every four pcp molecules. therapeutic and safety study endpoints included pregnancy outcome (litter size, number of live vs. dead pups), maternal hemodynamic status and locomotor activity. maternal hemodynamic changes (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate) and locomotor activity were measured in dams from gestation days 6-21 (one day antepartum) using a radiotelemetry-tracking device with a femoral arterial pressure catheter. this mab6b5 treatment regimen significantly (p=0.008) reduced the number of pcp-induced in utero fetal deaths (odds ratio=3.2; 95%ci 1.3 to 7.9) and significantly (p<0.05) reduced acute pcp-induced maternal locomotor effects in the second trimester. maternal hemodynamic responses to pcp were not significantly affected by mab6b5 treatment. in conclusion, these data suggest that anti-pcp mab treatments administered during pregnancy can safely protect a mother and her fetus(es) from pcp-related morbidity and mortality even when the mab dose is too low to significantly prevent other pcp-induced maternal pharmacological effects. the dependence-producing properties of 10 days of chronic i.v. infusions of phencyclidine (pcp) and the relationship between pcp serum concentrations and behavioral effects were studied in sprague-dawley rats. for dependence studies, rats were trained to respond for food under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule during half-hour response periods every 6 hr. after training, implantation of jugular catheters, and restabilization of behavior, the rats were infused with pcp.hcl at 3.2, 5.6, 10.0 or 17.8 mg/kg/day (n = 5 or 6 per dose). the two higher doses initially decreased response rates, but tolerance developed within 4 to 5 days. when pcp infusions were terminated, dose-dependent decreases in session response rate occurred in the three highest dose groups (p less than .05). mild, overt signs of abstinence were observed only in the highest dose group. response rates returned to base line within 2 to 3 days after stopping pcp infusions. pcp serum concentrations in rats infused with 10 mg of pcp.hcl/kg/day for 10 days were stable from hour 24 to day 10 (mean steady-state concentration (+/- s.d.) = 97 (+/- 20) ng of pcp/ml; n = 4). the average terminal elimination half-life after stopping infusions on day 10 was 4.6 hr. comparison of the average response rates with the average serum concentrations showed that during the first 24 hr of infusions, the rate of responding for food decreased as pcp concentrations increased; however, once the animals became tolerant to pcp there was no relationship. in contrast, during the first 24 hr after stopping infusions, response rates decreased as serum concentrations decreased.
in this work, the complete cdna sequence encoding angiotensinogen (agt) in the euryhaline flatfish senegalese sole was obtained. additionally, putative coding sequences belonging to other renin-angiotensin system (ras) genes including renin (ren), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), as well as angiotensin ii receptor type i (agtr1) and type ii (agtr2), were also identified. in juvenile tissues, agt transcripts were mainly detected in liver, ren in kidney, ace and ace2 in intestine, agtr1 in kidney and brain, and agtr2 in liver and kidney. expression analysis of the six ras genes after a salinity shift revealed a clear increase of agt mrna abundance in liver just after transferring soles to high salinity water (60 ppt) with a peak at 48 h. moreover, gene expression analysis in gills showed transcriptional regulation of ace and agtr1 at 48 h and agtr2 at 96 h after transferring soles to 60 ppt. incubation of larvae before mouth opening (until 3 days post hatch; dph) at low salinity (10 ppt) resulted in a coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of ras genes. nevertheless, no differences in mrna abundance between salinities were observed when larvae were cultivated to low salinity after mouth opening. whole-mount in situ hybridization (wish) signal for agt and ace in 3 dph larvae incubated at 10 ppt and 35 ppt confirmed that the former gene was mainly expressed in liver whereas the later gene was mainly located in pharynx and posterior gut, without pronounced differences in intensity between salinities. possible physiological significance of all these results is discussed. angiotensinogen (agt) is the precursor of the renin-angiotensin system and contributes to osmoregulation, acute-phase and immune responses. a full-length cdna of the agt (2004 bp with a 1389 bp coding region) was isolated from rock bream (rb), oplegnathus fasciatus. the encoded polypeptide of 463 amino acids had a predicted molecular mass of 51.6 kda. rbagt possessed a deduced signal peptide of 22 residues upstream of a putative angiotensin i sequence ((23)nrvyvhpfhl(32)). rbagt possessed a specific domain profile and a signature motif which are characteristics of the serpin family. sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that rbagt was evolutionarily closest to agt of rhabdosargus sarba. the mrna expression profile of rbagt was determined by quantitative rt-pcr and it demonstrated a constitutive and tissue-specific expression with the highest transcript level in the liver. significantly up-regulated rbagt expression was elicited by systemic injection of a lipopolysaccharide, rock bream iridovirus (rbiv) and bacteria (edwardsiella tarda and streptococcus iniae), revealing its pathogen inducibility. rbagt manifested a down-regulated response to systemic injury, contemporaneously with two other serpins, protease nexin-1 (pn-1), and heparin cofactor ii (hcii). in addition, a synchronized expression pattern was elicited by rbagt and rbtnf-α in response to injury, suggesting that tnf-α might be a potential modulator of agt transcription.
information on patients’ preferences is essential to guide the development of more efficient genomic counseling service delivery models. we examined patient preferences in the context of use of a post-test genomic counseling framework on patients (n = 44) with chronic disease receiving online test reports for eight different diseases and one drug-response result. we also explored patients’ disease risk awareness, recall of test report information, and confidence in knowing what to do with their test results. prior to the post-test genomic counseling session, all participants viewed at least one test report; 81.6% of available test reports were reviewed in total. participants requested more phone (36) than in-person counseling sessions (8), and phone sessions were shorter (mean 29.1 min; range 12–75 min) than in-person sessions (mean 52.8 min; range 23–85 min). a total of 182 test reports were discussed over the course of 44 counseling sessions (mean 4.13, range 1–9). thirty-six (81.8%) participants requested assessment for additional medical/family history concerns. in exploring patient experiences of disease risk awareness and recall, no significant differences were identified in comparison to those of participants (n = 199) that had received in-person post-test genomic counseling in a parent study randomized controlled trial (rct). in summary, a novel post-test genomic counseling framework allowed for a tailored approach to counseling based on the participants’ predetermined choices. there has been very limited study of patients with chronic disease receiving potentially actionable genomic based results or the utilization of genetic counselors in the online result delivery process. we conducted a randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age = 57.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. in contrast, control arm participants (n = 101; mean age = 58.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. a total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. we found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. in conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. these results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.
gene expression profiling of psoriasis has driven research advances and may soon provide the basis for clinical applications. for expression profiling studies, rna-seq is now a competitive technology, but rna-seq results may differ from those obtained by microarray. we therefore compared findings obtained by rna-seq with those from eight microarray studies of psoriasis. rna-seq and microarray datasets identified similar numbers of differentially expressed genes (degs), with certain genes uniquely identified by each technology. correspondence between platforms and the balance of increased to decreased degs was influenced by mrna abundance, gc content, and gene length. weakly expressed genes, genes with low gc content, and long genes were all biased toward decreased expression in psoriasis lesions. the strength of these trends differed among array datasets, most likely due to variations in rna quality. gene length bias was by far the strongest trend and was evident in all datasets regardless of the expression profiling technology. the effect was due to differences between lesional and uninvolved skin with respect to the genome-wide correlation between gene length and gene expression, which was consistently more negative in psoriasis lesions. these findings demonstrate the complementary nature of rna-seq and microarray technology and show that integrative analysis of both data types can provide a richer view of the transcriptome than strict reliance on a single method alone. our results also highlight factors affecting correspondence between technologies, and we have established that gene length is a major determinant of differential expression in psoriasis lesions. next-generation sequencing (ngs) has caused a revolution in biology. ngs requires the preparation of libraries in which (fragments of) dna or rna molecules are fused with adapters followed by pcr amplification and sequencing. it is evident that robust library preparation methods that produce a representative, non-biased source of nucleic acid material from the genome under investigation are of crucial importance. nevertheless, it has become clear that ngs libraries for all types of applications contain biases that compromise the quality of ngs datasets and can lead to their erroneous interpretation. a detailed knowledge of the nature of these biases will be essential for a careful interpretation of ngs data on the one hand and will help to find ways to improve library quality or to develop bioinformatics tools to compensate for the bias on the other hand. in this review we discuss the literature on bias in the most common ngs library preparation protocols, both for dna sequencing (dna-seq) as well as for rna sequencing (rna-seq). strikingly, almost all steps of the various protocols have been reported to introduce bias, especially in the case of rna-seq, which is technically more challenging than dna-seq. for each type of bias we discuss methods for improvement with a view to providing some useful advice to the researcher who wishes to convert any kind of raw nucleic acid into an ngs library.
podocyte injury is associated with progression of many renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. in this study we examined whether aldose reductase (ar), the enzyme implicated in diabetic complications in different tissues, is modulated by high glucose and osmolarity in podocyte cells. ar mrna, protein expression, and activity were measured in mouse podocytes cultured in both normal and high glucose and osmolarity for 6 hours to 5 days. hyperosmolarity acutely stimulated ar expression and activity, with subsequent increase of ar expression but decrease of activity. high glucose also elevated ar protein level; however, this was not accompanied by respective enzyme activation. furthermore, high glucose appeared to counteract the osmolarity-dependent activation of ar. in conclusion, in podocytes ar is modulated by high glucose and increased osmolarity in a different manner. posttranslational events may affect ar activity independent of enzyme protein amount. activation of ar in podocytes may be implicated in diabetic podocytopathy. podocytes possess the complete machinery for glutamatergic signaling, raising the possibility that neuron-like signaling contributes to glomerular function. to test this, we studied mice and cells lacking rab3a, a small gtpase that regulates glutamate exocytosis. in addition, we blocked the glutamate ionotropic n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) with specific antagonists. in mice, the absence of rab3a and blockade of nmdar both associated with an increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. in humans, nmdar blockade, obtained by addition of ketamine to general anesthesia, also had an albuminuric effect. in vitro, rab3a-null podocytes displayed a dysregulated release of glutamate with higher rates of spontaneous exocytosis, explained by a reduction in rab3a effectors resulting in freedom of vesicles from the actin cytoskeleton. in addition, nmdar antagonism led to profound cytoskeletal remodeling and redistribution of nephrin in cultured podocytes; the addition of the agonist nmda reversed these changes. in summary, these results suggest that glutamatergic signaling driven by podocytes contributes to the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and that derangements in this signaling may lead to proteinuric renal diseases.
hulls from dry edible beans are rich in phenolic compounds recognized as possessing antioxidant activity. the aim of this study was to characterize antioxidant properties of bean hull extract (bhe) and to determine whether bhe supplementation (at 400 or 800 mg/kg for 3 months) affects serum biochemical markers and bone structure in 12-month-old male c57bl/6 mice. mice supplemented with 800 mg bhe/ kg had lower serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and parathyroid hormone concentrations than those on control diet or supplemented with 400 mg bhe/kg. bhe supplementation caused slight decrease in oxidized glutathione concentration in blood (p = 0.07). compared to the control group, bhe supplementation at 800 mg/kg for 3 months improved bone structural indices, bone mineral density and trabecular thickness in the third lumbar vertebra. these results suggest that bhe supplementation may have beneficial effects on bone health in mice by decreasing bone resorption. published by elsevier ltd. the objective of this study was to characterize the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of u.s.-produced cool season legumes. a total of 33 cool season legume samples were selected. some common beans and soybeans were included for comparisons. total phenolic content (tpc), total flavonoid content (tfc), and condensed tannin content (ctc) were analyzed. ferric reducing antioxidant power (frap), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging assay, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac) were used for analyzing antioxidant properties. color of the legume flour and the seed coat was also analyzed. tpc, tfc, ctc, frap, dpph, and orac values of legumes were significantly different not only between classes but also among samples within each class. among cool season legume classes, lentils possessed the highest concentrations of the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities. colored common beans and black soybeans exhibited higher tpc, tfc, ctc, frap, dpph, and orac values than those of yellow peas, green peas, and chickpeas. antioxidant activities (frap, dpph, and orac) were strongly correlated (r= 0.96, 0.94, and 0.89, respectively, p < 0.01) with tpc. tpc and orac were moderately correlated (p < 0.01) with either the seed hull surface color or the flour color.
backgroundclinicians ordering multi-gene next-generation sequencing panels for hereditary breast cancer risk have a variety of test panel options. many panels include lesser known breast cancer genes or genes associated with other cancers. the authors hypothesized that using broader gene panels increases the identification of clinically significant findings, some relevant and others incidental to the testing indication. they examined clinician ordering patterns and compared the yield of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (p/lp) variants in non-brca genes of female breast cancer patients.methodsthis study analyzed de-identified personal and family histories in 1085 breast cancer cases with p/lp multi-gene panel findings in non-brca cancer genes and sorted them into three groups by the panel used for testing: group a (breast cancer genes only), group b (commonly assessed cancers: breast, gynecologic, and gastrointestinal), and group c (a more expanded set of tumors). the frequency of p/lp variants in genes with established management guidelines was compared and evaluated for consistency with personal and family histories.resultsthis study identified 1131 p/lp variants and compared variants in clinically actionable genes for breast and non-breast cancers. overall, 91.5% of these variants were in genes with management guidelines. nearly 12% were unrelated to personal or family history.conclusionbroader panels were used for 85.6% of our cohort (groups b and c). although pathogenic variants in non-brca genes are reportedly rare, the study found that most were in clinically actionable genes. expanded panel testing improved the identification of hereditary cancer risk. small, breast-limited panels may miss clinically relevant findings in genes associated with other heritable cancers. background advances in next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies are driving a shift from single-gene to multigene panel testing for clinical genetic cancer risk assessment (gcra). this study explored perceptions, experiences, and challenges with ngs testing for gcra among u.s. community-based clinicians.   methods surveys delivered at initial and 8-month time points, and 12-month tracking of cases presented in a multidisciplinary web-based case conference series, were conducted with gcra providers who participated in a 235-member nationwide community of practice.   results the proportion of respondents ordering panel tests rose from 29% at initial survey (27/94) to 44% (46/107) within 8 months. respondents reported significantly less confidence about interpreting and counseling about ngs compared with single-gene test results (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). the most cited reasons for not ordering ngs tests included concerns about clinical utility, interpreting and communicating results, and lack of knowledge/skills. multigene panels were used in 204/668 cases presented during 2013, yielding 37 (18%) deleterious (7% in low/moderate-penetrance genes), 88 (43%) with ≥1 variant of uncertain significance, 77 (38%) uninformative negative, and 2 (1%) inconclusive results.   conclusions despite concerns about utility and ability to interpret/counsel about ngs results, a rapidly increasing uptake of ngs testing among community clinicians was documented. challenges identified in case discussions point to the need for ongoing education, practice-based support, and opportunities to partner in research that contributes to characterization of lesser known genes.
background trauma systems are designed to deliver timely and appropriate care. prehospital triage regulations and interfacility transfer guidelines are the primary determinants of system efficacy. we analyzed the effectiveness of the florida trauma system in delivering trauma patients to trauma centers over time.   study design injured patients were identified by icd-9 codes from a statewide discharge dataset, and they were categorized as children (less than 16 years old), adult (16 to 65 years old), or elderly (over 65 years old). severe injury was defined by international classification injury severity scores (iciss) < 0.85. residence zip codes were used as a surrogate for injury location.   results severe injury discharges increased at designated trauma centers (dtcs) and decreased at nontrauma centers (ntcs). the proportion of patients with severe injuries discharged from dtcs increased for all age groups, capturing nearly all severely injured children and adults. access to dtcs was dependent on proximity for severely injured elderly but not for severely injured children and adults.   conclusions triage improved over time, enabling near complete capture of at-risk children and adults independent of dtc proximity. because distance from a dtc does not limit access for children and adults, existing trauma system resources are sufficient to meet the current demands. efforts are needed to determine the trauma resource and triage needs of the severely injured elderly. background the injury severity score (iss) has served as the standard summary measure of human trauma for 20 years. despite its stalwart service, the iss has two weaknesses: it relies upon the consensus derived severity estimates for each abbreviated injury scale (ais) injury and considers, at most, only three of an individual patient's injuries, three injuries that often are not even the patient's most severe injuries. additionally, the iss requires that all patients have their injuries described in the ais lexicon, an expensive step that is currently taken only at hospitals with a zealous commitment to trauma care. we hypothesized that a data driven alternative to iss that used empirically derived injury severities and considered all of an individual patient's injuries would more accurately predict survival.   methods survival risk ratios were derived for every international classification of disease 9th edition (icd-9) injury category (800-959.9) using the north carolina state discharge database experience with 300,000 trauma patients over 5 years. an icd-9 injury severity score (iciss) was then defined as the product of all survival risk ratios for an individual patient's traumatic icd-9 codes. we compared the performance of iss and iciss in a group of 3,142 patients accrued at the university of new mexico trauma center over 4 years. these patients had both ais and icd-9 descriptors meticulously assigned prospectively by designated trauma data base personnel.   results iciss outperformed iss at a level that was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001) and may be clinically important: iss misclassification rate 7.67%, iss receiver operator characteristic curve area = 0.872; iciss misclassification rate 5.95%, iciss receiver operator characteristic curve area = 0.921. moreover, these improvements are largely preserved when iciss is used in a probability of survival model that includes age, mechanism, and revised trauma score. about half of iciss's improvement in predictive power is because of its use of an individual patient's worst three injuries regardless of body region. the remainder is because of better modeling of individual injuries and allowing all injuries to contribute to the final score.   conclusions we conclude that iciss is a much better predictor of survival than iss in injured patients. the use of the icd-9 lexicon may avoid the need for ais coding, and thus may add an economic incentive to the statistical appeal of iciss. it is possible that a similar data driven revision of iss using the ais vocabulary might perform as well or better than iciss. indeed, the actual lexicon used to divide up the injury "landscape" into individual injuries may be of little consequence so long as all injuries are considered and empirically derived srrs are used to calculate the final injury measure.
[1] this study aims to quantify the impact of strong monsoons on the mixed layer heat budget in the arabian sea by contrasting forced ocean general circulation model simulations with composite strong and weak monsoon winds. strong (weak) monsoons are defined as years with zonal component of the somali jet being greater (smaller) by more than a standard deviation of the long-term mean of the national centers for environmental prediction reanalysis winds. coastal upwelling is shown to be demonstrably stronger for strong monsoons leading to significant surface cooling, shallower thermoclines, and deeper mixed layers. a coupled ecosystem model shows that surface chlorophyll, primary, and export production are indeed higher for strong monsoons compared to weak monsoons driven by the supply of colder, nutrient-rich waters from greater than 100 m depths. the surprising result is that a strong monsoon results in stronger negative wind stress curl away from the coasts and drives ekman pumping that results in a deeper thermocline. the weaker stratification and larger turbulent kinetic energy from the winds drive deeper mixed layers leading entrainment cooling with some contribution from the advection of colder upwelled waters from the coastal upwelling regions. thus the strong monsoons, in fact, enhance oceanic heat uptake indicating that ocean dynamics are cooling the surface and driving the lower atmosphere which has implications for the interpretation of monsoon variability from paleorecords. variations in the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth are thought to influence climate, but the extent of this influence on timescales of millennia to decades is unclear. a number of climate records show correlations between solar cycles and climate, but the absolute changes in solar intensity over the range of decades to millennia are small and the influence of solar flux on climate is not well established. the formation of stalagmites in northern oman has recorded past northward shifts of the intertropical convergence zone, whose northward migration stops near the southern shoreline of arabia in the present climate. here we present a high-resolution record of oxygen isotope variations, for the period from 9.6 to 6.1 kyr before present, in a th–u-dated stalagmite from oman. the δ18o record from the stalagmite, which serves as a proxy for variations in the tropical circulation and monsoon rainfall, allows us to make a direct comparison of the δ18o record with the δ14c record from tree rings, which largely reflects changes in solar activity. the excellent correlation between the two records suggests that one of the primary controls on centennial- to decadal-scale changes in tropical rainfall and monsoon intensity during this time are variations in solar radiation.
caveolin-3 the muscle-specific caveolin isoform, acts like the more ubiquitously expressed caveolin-1 to sculpt caveolae, specialized membrane microdomains that serve as platforms to organize signal transduction pathways. caveolin-2 is a structurally related isoform that alone does not drive caveolae biogenesis; rather, caveolin-2 cooperates with caveolin-1 to form caveolae in nonmuscle cells. although caveolin-2 might be expected to interact in an fashion analogous to that of caveolin-3, it generally has not been detected in cardiomyocytes. this study shows that caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 are detected at low levels in ventricular myocardium and increase dramatically with age or when neonatal cardiomyocytes are placed in culture. in contrast, flotillins (caveolin functional homologs) are expressed at relatively constant levels in these preparations. in neonatal cardiac cultures, caveolin-2 and -3 expression is not influenced by thyroid hormone (a postnatal regulator of other cardiac gene products). the further evidence that caveolin-2 coimmunoprecipitates with caveolin-3 and floats with caveolin-3 by isopycnic centrifugation in cardiomyocyte cultures suggests that caveolin-2 may play a role in caveolae biogenesis and influence cardiac muscle physiology. differential modes for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (ar) regulation of adenylyl cyclase in cardiomyocytes is most consistent with spatial regulation in microdomains of the plasma membrane. this study examines whether caveolae represent specialized subdomains that concentrate and organize these moieties in cardiomyocytes. caveolae from quiescent rat ventricular cardiomyocytes are highly enriched in beta(2)-ars, galpha(i), protein kinase a riialpha subunits, caveolin-3, and flotillins (caveolin functional homologues); beta(1)-ars, m(2)-muscarinic cholinergic receptors, galpha(s), and cardiac types v/vi adenylyl cyclase distribute between caveolae and other cell fractions, whereas protein kinase a rialpha subunits, g protein-coupled receptor kinase-2, and clathrin are largely excluded from caveolae. cell surface beta(2)-ars localize to caveolae in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (with markedly different beta(2)-ar expression levels), indicating that the fidelity of beta(2)-ar targeting to caveolae is maintained over a physiologic range of beta(2)-ar expression. in cardiomyocytes, agonist stimulation leads to a marked decline in the abundance of beta(2)-ars (but not beta(1)-ars) in caveolae. other studies show co-immunoprecipitation of cardiomyocytes adenylyl cyclase v/vi and caveolin-3, suggesting their in vivo association. however, caveolin is not required for adenylyl cyclase targeting to low density membranes, since adenylyl cyclase targets to low buoyant density membrane fractions of hek cells that lack prototypical caveolins. nevertheless, cholesterol depletion with cyclodextrin augments agonist-stimulated camp accumulation, indicating that caveolae function as negative regulators of camp accumulation. the inhibitory interaction between caveolae and the camp signaling pathway as well as domain-specific differences in the stoichiometry of individual elements in the beta-ar signaling cascade represent important modifiers of camp-dependent signaling in the heart.
non‐technical summary  interstitial cells of cajal (icc) are tightly associated with excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons in the gastrointestinal tract, and these cells are also connected electrically to smooth muscle cells. we have suggested that icc participate in responses to neurotransmitters released from neurons that drive motility and help move nutrients and wastes through the gut. we studied responses of isolated icc to cholinergic neurotransmitter and found that a ca2+‐activated cl− current is activated in icc in response to cholinergic stimulation. such a current would result in depolarization that could be conducted to surrounding smooth muscle cells by the electrical connections. exciting icc would cause generalized excitation of the smooth muscle tissue. a different conductance is activated in smooth muscle cells by cholinergic stimulation. we tested drugs that blocked the cl− current in icc and found that responses to nerve stimulation in intact intestinal muscles were blocked by these drugs. this suggests that icc mediate electrical responses to cholinergic nerve stimulation. in some human gastrointestinal motility disorders, icc are damaged or lost. if these cells provide responses to neurotransmitters, this might provide an explanation for motor dysfunction in the gut. evidence showing that interstitial cells of cajal have important regulatory functions in the gut musculature is accumulating. in the current study, the ultrastructure of the deep muscular plexus and associated interstial cells of cajal in human small intestine were studied to provide a reference for identification and further physiological or pathological studies. the deep muscular plexus was sandwiched between a thin inner layer of smooth muscle (one to five cells thick) and the bulk of the circular muscle. interstitial cells of cajal in this region very much resembled smooth muscle cells (with a continuous basal lamina, caveolae, intermediate filaments, dense bodies, dense bands, and a well-developed subsurface smooth endoplasmic reticulum), but the arrangement of organelles was clearly different, and cisternae of granular endoplasmic reticulum were abundant. interstitial cells of cajal were distinguished from fibroblasts or macrophages in the region. they ramified in the inner zone of the outer division of circular muscle, penetrated the inner-most circular layer, and were also found at the submucosal border. they were in close, synapselike contact with nerve terminals of the deep muscular plexus, and only few gap junctions with other interstitial cells of cajal or with the musculature were observed. compared with interstitial cells of cajal from other mammals, those associated with the deep muscular plexus in the human small intestine more closely resemble smooth muscle cells, and their organization appears more diffuse; however, the ultrastructure and organization of interstitial cells of cajal is compatible with modulatory actions on the circular muscle also in humans.
we consider a fading point-to-point link with packets arriving randomly at rate $\lambda$ per slot to the transmitter queue. we assume that the transmitter can control the number of packets served in a slot by varying the transmit power for the slot. we restrict to transmitter scheduling policies that are monotone and stationary, i.e., the number of packets served is a non-decreasing function of the queue length at the beginning of the slot for every slot fade state. for such policies, we obtain asymptotic lower bounds for the minimum average delay of the packets, when average transmitter power is a small positive quantity $v$ more than the minimum average power required for transmitter queue stability. we show that the minimum average delay grows either to a finite value or as $\omega\brap{\log(1/v)}$ or $\omega\brap{1/v}$ when $v \downarrow 0$, for certain sets of values of $\lambda$. these sets are determined by the distribution of fading gain, the maximum number of packets which can be transmitted in a slot, and the transmit power function of the fading gain and the number of packets transmitted that is assumed. we identify a case where the above behaviour of the tradeoff differs from that obtained from a previously considered approximate model, in which the random queue length process is assumed to evolve on the non-negative real line, and the transmit power function is strictly convex. we also consider a fading point-to-point link, where the transmitter, in addition to controlling the number of packets served, can also control the number of packets admitted in every slot. our approach, which uses bounds on the stationary probability distribution of the queue length, also leads to an intuitive explanation of the asymptotic behaviour of average delay in the regime where $v \downarrow 0$. we consider the fundamental delay tradeoffs for utility optimal scheduling in a general network with time-varying channels. a network controller acts on randomly arriving data and makes flow control, routing, and resource allocation decisions to maximize a fairness metric based on a concave utility function of network throughput. a simple set of algorithms are constructed that yield total utility within o(1/v) of the utility-optimal operating point, for any control parameter v>0, with a corresponding end-to-end network delay that grows only logarithmically in v. this is the first algorithm to achieve such "super-fast" performance. furthermore, we show that this is the best utility-delay tradeoff possible. this work demonstrates that the problem of maximizing throughput utility in a data network is fundamentally different than related problems of minimizing average power expenditure, as these latter problems cannot achieve such performance tradeoffs
we investigated the role of subjective factors in the information search process. forty-eight participants each conducted six web searches in a controlled setting. we examined relationships between subjective factors (happiness levels, satisfaction with and confidence in the search results, feeling lost during search, familiarity with and interest in the search topic, estimation of task difficulty) and objective factors (search behavior, search outcomes, and search-task characteristics). data analysis was conducted using a multivariate statistical test (canonical correlations analysis). the findings confirmed existence of several relationships suggested by prior research, including relationships between objective search task difficulty and the perception of task difficulty, and between subjective states and search behaviors and outcomes. one of the original findings suggests that higher happiness levels before and during the search correlate with better feelings after the search, but also correlate with worse search outcomes and lower satisfaction, suggesting that, perhaps, it pays off to feel some “pain” during the search to “gain” quality outcomes. this study examined the success and information seeking behaviors of seventh-grade science students and graduate students in information science in using yahooligans! web search engine/directory. it investigated these users' cognitive, affective, and physical behaviors as they sought the answer for a fact-finding task. it analyzed and compared the overall patterns of children's and graduate students' web activities, including searching moves, browsing moves, backtracking moves, looping moves, screen scrolling, target location and deviation moves, and the time they took to complete the task. the authors applied bilal's web traversal measure to quantify these users' effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of moves they made. results were based on 14 children's web sessions and nine graduate students' sessions. both groups' web activities were captured online using lotus screencam, a software package that records and replays online activities in web browsers. children's affective states were captured via exit interviews. graduate students' affective states were extracted from the journal writings they kept during the traversal process. the study findings reveal that 89% of the graduate students found the correct answer to the search task as opposed to 50% of the children. based on the measure, graduate students' weighted effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of the web moves they made were much higher than those of the children. regardless of success and weighted scores, however, similarities and differences in information seeking were found between the two groups. yahooligans! poor structure of keyword searching was a major factor that contributed to the "breakdowns" children and graduate students experienced. unlike children, graduate students were able to recover from "breakdowns" quickly and effectively. three main factors influenced these users' performance: ability to recover from "breakdowns", navigational style, and focus on task. children and graduate students made recommendations for improving yahooligans! interface design. implications for web user training and system design improvements are made.
neuronal loss alongside altered energy metabolism, are key features of huntington’s disease (hd) pathology. the orexigenic gut-peptide hormone ghrelin is known to stimulate appetite and affect whole body energy metabolism. liraglutide is an efficient anti-type 2 diabetes incretin drug, with neuroprotective effects alongside anorectic properties. combining liraglutide with the orexigenic peptide ghrelin may potentially promote brain/cognitive function in hd. the r6/2 mouse model of hd exhibits progressive central pathology, weight loss, deranged glucose metabolism, skeletal muscle atrophy and altered body composition. in this study, we targeted energy metabolism in r6/2 mice using a co-administration of liraglutide and ghrelin. we investigated their effect on brain cortical hormone-mediated intracellular signalling pathways, metabolic and apoptotic markers, and the impact on motor function in hd. we here demonstrate that liraglutide, alone or together with ghrelin (subcutaneous daily injections of 150 µg/kg (ghrelin) and 0.2 mg/kg (liraglutide), for 2 weeks), normalized glucose homeostatic features in the r6/2 mouse, without substantially affecting body weight or body composition. liraglutide alone decreased brain cortical active glp-1 and igf-1 levels in r6/2 mice, alongside higher adp levels. liraglutide plus ghrelin decreased brain insulin, lactate, amp and cholesterol levels in r6/2 mice. taken together, our findings encourage further studies targeting energy metabolism in hd. huntington's disease (hd) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease selectively leading to striatal neurodegeneration, but also affecting the cortex and the hypothalamus. although it is hard to predict the sequence of cell-damaging events occurring in hd patients, several pathological mechanisms have been proposed to explain hd selective neurodegeneration and disease symptomatology. abnormalities in mitochondrial function and bioenergetics contribute to cell death and have been reported in hd-affected individuals, both in central and peripheral tissues. moreover, the latter has been characterized in several hd models. thus, this review describes the converging mechanisms that lead to mitochondrial and metabolic abnormalities in thoroughly studied in vivo and in vitro hd models, including excitotoxicity, altered calcium handling, changes in mitochondrial structure and dynamics and transcription deregulation, which may represent important disease therapeutic targets. furthermore, the review describes the current evidences of metabolic disturbances in the brain of hd-affected humans and of peripheral metabolic and mitochondrial changes, weight loss and endocrine abnormalities operating in the whole hd body.
significance we characterize in humans a coordinated network of brain activity describing neurobehavioral correlates of reward anticipation. the network involves nodes in striatal and cortical brain regions, which are preferentially associated with distinct externalizing behaviors—hyperactivity and alcohol consumption—suggesting that the heterogeneity of reward-related behaviors might be accounted for by different association patterns of nodes and their connecting links. in a genome-wide association study of the striatal node with subsequent functional validation in drosophila, we identify molecular genetic mechanisms involving vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4a (vps4a) in dopamine regulation, reward anticipation, and hyperactivity. our approach might facilitate the identification of causal neural mechanisms, important for the identification of previously unidentified targets and the establishment of neurobehaviorally informed end points for clinical trials. dysfunctional reward processing is implicated in various mental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and addictions. such impairments might involve different components of the reward process, including brain activity during reward anticipation. we examined brain nodes engaged by reward anticipation in 1,544 adolescents and identified a network containing a core striatal node and cortical nodes facilitating outcome prediction and response preparation. distinct nodes and functional connections were preferentially associated with either adolescent hyperactivity or alcohol consumption, thus conveying specificity of reward processing to clinically relevant behavior. we observed associations between the striatal node, hyperactivity, and the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4a (vps4a) gene in humans, and the causal role of vps4 for hyperactivity was validated in drosophila. our data provide a neurobehavioral model explaining the heterogeneity of reward-related behaviors and generate a hypothesis accounting for their enduring nature. a review of the existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies on reward anticipation in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is provided. meta-analysis showed a significant medium effect size (cohen's d=0.48-0.58) in terms of ventral-striatal (vs)-hyporesponsiveness in adhd. studies on vs-responsiveness and trait impulsivity in the healthy population demonstrate the opposite relationship, i.e. impulsivity-scores positively correlated with vs activation during reward processing. against the background that adhd may represent an extreme on a continuum of normal variability, the question arises as to how these contrasting findings can be integrated. we discuss three theoretical approaches, each of which integrates the opposing findings: (1) an inverted-u-shape model; (2) a (genetic) moderator model; and (3) the "unrelated model". we conclude that at the present stage the number of existing studies in the healthy population as well as in adhd groups is too small for a final answer. therefore, our presented integrative approaches should be understood as an attempt to frame future research directions by generating testable hypotheses and giving practical suggestions for future studies.
prenatal and early postnatal life experiences, reflected by size at birth and postnatal catch-up growth, contribute to the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome in adulthood, but their relative importance is unclear. therefore, we determined the effects of restricted placental and fetal growth on components of the metabolic syndrome in young adult sheep and the relationships of the latter to size at birth and early postnatal growth. fasting plasma metabolites, glucose tolerance (by intravenous glucose tolerance test, ivgtt), insulin secretion and sensitivity, and resting blood pressure were measured in 22 control and 20 placentally restricted (pr) 1-yr-old sheep. in male sheep, pr increased the initial rise in glucose during an ivgtt and reduced diastolic blood pressure, and small size at birth independently predicted reduced adult size, glucose tolerance, and fasting plasma insulin and insulin disposition of glucose metabolism but increased insulin disposition of circulating ffas. also in males, high fractional growth rates in early postnatal life independently predicted impaired early glucose clearance during an ivgtt. in female animals, pr increased insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism and reduced fasting plasma ffas, and thinness at birth predicted increased adult size, fasting blood glucose, and pulse pressure. in conclusion, pr and small size at birth are associated with more components of the metabolic syndrome in adult male than in adult female sheep, with few independent effects of early postnatal growth. these sex differences in the onset and extent of adverse metabolic consequences after prenatal restraint in the sheep are consistent with observations in humans. several studies have linked low birth weight (lbw) and type 2 diabetes. we investigated hepatic and peripheral insulin action including intracellular glucose metabolism in 40 19-year-old men (20 lbw, 20 matched control subjects), using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique at two physiological insulin levels (10 and 40 mu/m(2) per min), indirect calorimetry, and [3-(3)h]glucose. insulin secretion was examined during an oral and intravenous glucose tolerance test. fasting p-glucose was higher in the lbw group (5.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.1; p < 0.05). basal plasma glycerol concentrations were significantly lower in the lbw group. insulin-stimulated glycolytic flux was significantly reduced, and suppression of endogenous glucose production was enhanced in the lbw group. nevertheless, basal and insulin-stimulated rates of whole-body peripheral glucose disposal, glucose oxidation, lipid oxidation, exogenous glucose storage, and nonoxidative glucose metabolism were similar in the two groups. insulin secretion was reduced by 30% in the lbw group, when expressed relative to insulin sensitivity (disposition index = insulin secretion x insulin action). we propose that reduced insulin-stimulated glycolysis precedes overt insulin resistance in lbw men. a lower insulin secretion may contribute to impaired glucose tolerance and ultimately lead to diabetes.
background the prevalence of smoking is very high among methadone users. as a method of delivering health education, computers can be utilized effectively. however computer-assisted education in methadone users has not been evaluated systematically. objective this study was aimed at assessing feasibility and patient acceptance of an interactive educational module of a multi-component smoking cessation counseling computer program for former illicit drug users treated in an outpatient methadone clinic. methods the computer-mediated education for hazards of smoking utilized in this study was driven by major constructs of adult learning theories. the program interface was tailored to individuals with minimal computer experience and was implemented on a touch screen tablet pc. the number of consecutive methadone-treated current smokers enrolled in the study was 35. after providing socio-demographic and smoking profiles, the patients were asked to use the educational program for 40 minutes. the impact of the computer-mediated education was assessed by administering a pre- and post-intervention hazards of smoking knowledge survey (hsks). an attitudinal survey and semi-structured qualitative interview were used after the educational session to assess the opinions of participants about their educational experience. results the computer-mediated education resulted in significant increase of hsks scores from 60.5 ± 16.3 to 70.4 ± 11.7 with t value 3.69 and p < .001. the majority of the patients (78.8%) felt the tablet pc was easy to use, and most of the patients (91.4%) rated the educational experience as good or excellent. after controlling for patient baseline characteristics, the effect of computer-mediated education remained statistically significant. conclusions computer-assisted education using tablet pcs was feasible, well-accepted, and an effective means of providing hazards of smoking education among methadone users. the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a web-based computer-assisted education (co-ed) system versus searching the internet for learning about hypertension. twenty-two older adults (age 45+) in baltimore, md were enrolled. analysis of pre- and post- knowledge scores indicates a significant (15%) improvement among co-ed users as opposed to internet users.
glutamate release from photoreceptor terminals is controlled by voltage-dependent calcium channels (vdccs). in humans, mutations in the cacna1f gene, encoding the alpha1f subunit of vdccs, underlie the incomplete form of x-linked congenital stationary night blindness (csnb2). these mutations impair synaptic transmission from rod and cone photoreceptors to bipolar cells. here, we report anatomical and functional characterizations of the retina in the nob2 (no b-wave 2) mouse, a naturally occurring mutant caused by a null mutation in cacna1f. not surprisingly, the b-waves of both the light- and dark-adapted electroretinogram are abnormal in nob2 mice. the outer plexiform layer (opl) is disorganized, with extension of ectopic neurites through the outer nuclear layer that originate from rod bipolar and horizontal cells, but not from hyperpolarizing bipolar cells. these ectopic neurites continue to express mglur6, which is frequently associated with profiles that label with the presynaptic marker ribeye, indicating potential points of ectopic synapse formation. however, the morphology of the presynaptic ribeye-positive profiles is abnormal. while cone pedicles are present their morphology also appears compromised. characterizations of visual responses in retinal ganglion cells in vivo, under photopic conditions, demonstrate that on-center cells have a reduced dynamic range, although their basic center-surround organization is retained; no alteration in the responses of off-center cells was evident. these results indicate that nob2 mice are a valuable model in which to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with cacna1f mutations causing csnb2, and the subsequent effects on visual information processing. further, the nob2 mouse represents a model system in which to define the signals that guide synapse formation and/or maintenance in the opl. purpose the cacna1f gene encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel alpha1 subunit, alpha1f, which is expressed in the human retina. mutations in this gene cause incomplete x-linked congenital stationary night blindness (csnb2). the aim of this study was to obtain the sequence of the rat alpha1f cdna and localize the encoded polypeptide in the rat retina.   methods the full-length rat alpha1f sequence was compiled from sequencing of overlapping alpha1f pcr fragments amplified from rat retinal cdna. antiserum was raised against a human alpha1f peptide. it was found that the human alpha1f peptide used to generate the antiserum was conserved at only 11 out of 19 residues in the cloned rat sequence. therefore, antibodies were affinity purified against either the human alpha1f peptide or the equivalent rat peptide and used for immunofluorescent staining of rat retina sections.   results the rat alpha1f amino acid sequence was found to be 91% and 95% identical to the human and mouse alpha1f sequences, respectively. antibodies affinity purified against the human alpha1f peptide stained both the outer nuclear layer (onl) and outer plexiform layer of rat retina sections. in contrast, staining with antibodies affinity purified against the corresponding rat alpha1f peptide was restricted to the onl.   conclusions the rat alpha1f amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the human and mouse sequences. the immunohistochemical results indicate the existence of distinct alpha1f isoforms or alpha1f-like channels, which are differentially distributed in the cell bodies and synaptic terminals of photoreceptors in the rat retina.
the development of the drosophila wing disc requires the activities of the bmp and tgfβ signalling pathways. bmp signalling is critical for the correct growth and patterning of the disc, whereas the related tgfβ pathway is mostly required for growth. the bmp and tgfβ pathways share a common co-receptor (punt) and a nuclear effector (medea), and consequently it is likely that these pathways can interfere with each other during normal development. in this work we focus on the spatial activation domains and requirements for tgfβ signalling during wing disc development. we found that the phosphorylation of smad2, the specific transducer for tgfβ signalling, occurs in a generalised manner in the wing disc. it appears that the expression of the four candidate tgfβ ligands (activinβ, dawdle, maverick and myoglianin) in the wing disc is required to obtain normal levels of tgfβ signalling in this tissue. we show that baboon, the specific receptor of the tgfβ pathway, can phosphorylate mad, the specific transducer of the bmp pathway, in vivo. however, this activation only occurs in the wing disc when the receptor is constitutively activated in a background of reduced expression of smad2. in the presence of smad2, the normal situation during wing disc development, high levels of activated baboon lead to a depletion in mad phosphorylation and to bmp loss-of-function phenotypes. although loss of either babo or smad2 expression reduce growth in the wing blade in a similar manner, loss of smad2 can also cause phenotypes related to ectopic bmp signalling, suggesting a physiological role for this transducer in the regulation of mad spatial activation. the transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) superfamily encompasses a large group of soluble extracellular proteins that are potent regulators of development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. drosophila tgf-beta family members include three proteins with homology to vertebrate bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps): decapentaplegic (dpp), screw, and glass bottom boat-60a. genetic studies of dpp signaling led to the identification of smad proteins as central mediators of signal transduction by tgf-beta family members. work in mammalian tissue culture has elucidated a biochemical model for signal transduction, in which activation of receptor serine-threonine kinase activity leads to phosphorylation of specific smad proteins and translocation of heteromeric smad protein complexes to the nucleus. once in the nucleus smad proteins interact with other dna binding proteins to regulate transcription of specific target genes. dissection of dpp-response elements from genes expressed during embryonic mesoderm patterning and midgut morphogenesis provides important insights into the contributions of smad proteins and tissue-specific transcription factors to spatial regulation of gene expression. genetic studies in drosophila are now expanding to include multiple bmp ligands and receptors and have uncovered activities not explained by the current signal transduction model. identification of more ligand sequences and demonstration of a functional drosophila activin-like signal transduction pathway suggest that all tgf-beta signal transduction pathways are present in flies.
contextnatural disturbances can have a considerable negative impact on the productivity of forest landscapes. yet, disturbances are also important drivers of diversity, with diversity generally contributing positively to forest productivity. while the direct effects of disturbance have been investigated extensively it remains unclear how disturbance-mediated changes in diversity influence landscape productivity. considering that disturbances are increasing in many ecosystems a better understanding of disturbance impacts is of growing importance for ecosystem management.objectiveshere, our objectives were to study the effect of disturbance on tree species diversity at different spatial scales (α and β diversity), and to analyze how a disturbance-mediated variation in tree species diversity affects forest productivity.methodsto account for long-term interactions between disturbance, diversity, and productivity and test a range of disturbance scenarios we used simulation modeling, focusing on a temperate forest landscape in central europe.resultswe found an overall positive effect of disturbance on tree species diversity both with regard to α and β diversity, persisting under elevated disturbance frequencies. productivity was enhanced by within- and between-stand diversity, with the effect of α diversity decreasing and that of β diversity increasing through the successional development. positive diversity effects were found to be strongly contingent on the available species pool, with landscapes containing species with different life-history strategies responding most strongly to disturbance-mediated diversity.conclusionswe conclude that, rather than homogenizing disturbed areas, forest managers should incorporate the diversity created by disturbances into stand development to capitalize on a positive diversity effect on productivity. disturbance has many effects on ecological communities, and it is often suggested that disturbance can affect species diversity by altering competitive outcomes. however, disturbance regimes have many distinct aspects that may act, and interact, to influence species diversity. while there are many theoretical models of disturbance-prone communities, few have specifically documented how interactions between different aspects of a disturbance regime change competitive outcomes. here, we present a model of two plant species subject to disturbance which we then use to examine species coexistence over varying levels of two aspects of disturbance: frequency, and spatial extent (i.e., area disturbed). we show that the competitive outcome is affected differently by changes in each aspect and that the effect of disturbance frequency on species coexistence depends strongly on the spatial extent of the disturbance, and vice versa. we classify the nature of these interactions between disturbance frequency and extent on the basis of the shape of the resulting coexistence regions in a frequency–extent parameter plane. our results illustrate that different types of interaction can result from differences in life-history traits that control species-specific sensitivity to frequency and extent of disturbance. thus, our analysis shows that the various aspects of disturbance must be carefully considered in concert with the life-history traits of the community members in order to assess the consequences of disturbance.
prenatal ontogeny of the human neocortex exhibits specific characteristics that make its organization unique. therefore, experimental data obtained on animal models cannot be extrapolated to human cortex morphogenesis during the middle and late gestational periods. characteristics of the development of cortical pyramidal neurons of the human brain were studied in the brains of eight fetuses at gestational ages between 16 and 26 weeks. immunohistochemical labeling of neurons was performed using antibodies against microtubule associated protein 2 (map2), a structural protein of microtubules. expression of this protein marks the beginning of dendrogenesis. map2 is mainly located in the neuron body and dendrites, which allowed the neuron morphotype and location in specific cortical layers to be determined. it was shown that map2-immunopositive neurons were identifiable in embryonic cortical layer ev as early as the 18th gestational week. by the 25th gestational week, two populations of pyramidal neurons were discernible in the cortical plate, one of them located in layer ev and the other, in layer eiii, which developed later. since differentiating neurons are known to be more vulnerable than neuroblasts and mature neurons, these results suggest that critical periods for corticofugal and corticocortical populations of pyramidal cells occur at different stages of the second gestational trimester. information about development of the human cerebral cortex (proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons) is largely based on postmortem histology. physiological properties of developing human cortical neurons are difficult to access experimentally and therefore remain largely unexplored. animal studies have shown that information about the arousal of electrical activity in individual cells within fundamental cortical zones (subventricular zone [svz], intermediate zone, subplate [sp], and cortical plate [cp]) is necessary for understanding normal brain development. here we ask where, in what cortical zone, and when, in what gestational week (gw), human neurons acquire the ability to generate nerve impulses (action potentials [aps]). we performed electrical recordings from individual cells in acute brain slices harvested postmortem from the human fetal cerebral cortex (16-22 gw). tetrodotoxin-sensitive na(+) current occurs more frequently among cp cells and with significantly greater peak amplitudes than in svz. as early as 16 gw, a relatively small population of cp neurons (27%) was able to generate sodium aps upon direct current injection. neurons located in the sp exhibited the highest level of cellular differentiation, as judged by their ability to fire repetitive aps. at 19 gw, a fraction of human cp and sp neurons possess beta iv spectrin-positive axon initial segments populated with voltage-gated sodium channels (pannav). these results yield the first physiological characterization of developing human fetal cortical neurons with preserved morphologies in intact surrounding brain tissue.
we have recently shown that spinal calmodulin inhibitors (w-7 and calmidazolium) dose-dependently inhibit the nociceptive reaction (biting, scratching, licking, bsl) evoked by intrathecal n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) and septide, an agonist of the neurokinin (nk) nk1 receptor. to compare this effect with that induced by standard analgesics, we now report a study of the effects of calmidazolium (14–420 nmol), bupivacaine (29–582 nmol) and morphine (26–260 nmol) when coadministered intrathecally with either nmda (4 µg) or septide (0.5 µg). calmidazolium had the highest potency for inhibiting septide-induced nociceptive behaviour, acting over a dose range of 34–130 nmol (dose eliciting a half-maximal response, ed50, 67 nmol) lower than that of bupivacaine [ed50 234 (115–475) nmol]. only the highest dose of morphine (260 nmol) inhibited septide-evoked bsl [ed50=133 (69–255) nmol]. higher doses of morphine could not be tested due to the appearance of an excitatory aversive reaction. both calmidazolium [ed50=232 (138–388) nmol] and bupivacaine [ed50=123 (59–256) nmol] dose-dependently reduced nmda-induced bsl reaching an almost maximal inhibition at the highest doses assayed (420 and 291 nmol, respectively). in contrast, morphine had less effect on nmda-induced behaviour, inducing only a partial reduction of bsl even with the highest dose assayed (260 nmol). overall, it can be concluded that the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium inhibits septide- and nmda-evoked nociceptive behaviour with a potency and efficacy at least as high as those of morphine and bupivacaine. intrathecal injection of substance p produced a behavioural syndrome, consisting of reciproacal hindlimb scratching and biting or fore- and hind-licking. pretreatment with either an analogue of substance p, (d-pro2, d-trp7,9)-substance p (dpdt-sp) or (d-arg1, d-pro2,4, d-trp7,9, leu11)-substance p, given intrathecally, reduced the response to substance p in a dose-dependent manner. the behaviour induced by substance p was also inhibited by intrathecal, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of morphine. intrathecal or subcutaneous injection of naloxone showed a biphasic effect on substance p response; the substance p-induced nociceptive response was increased by a small dose of naloxone, while it was inversely decreased by a large dose of naloxone. the results with analogues of substance p support the hypothesis that substance p, injected intrathecally, acts directly on substance p receptors in the spinal cord. the nociceptive response induced by substance p appears to be controlled by endogenous opioids in the spinal cord.
intraoperative consultation is an important component in the surgical management of brain tumors. this study was undertaken to describe the cytomorphological features of central neurocytoma (cn) in squash smears. squash smear of five cns were reviewed. one to two millimeters of the biopsy material was crushed between two glass slides to make a thin film that was fixed in 95% alcohol and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (h&e). cytological diagnoses were correlated with clinical and radiological data and finally with histopathological findings in the tumor. we had 5 cases (4 males, 1 female; age, 19–61 years; mean, 32 years). all tumors were located in the lateral ventricle. the smears were highly cellular displaying monomoprhic round tumor cells, round to oval nuclei with evenly distributed finely granular chromatin and ill‐defined cytoplasmic borders within fibrillar matrix. focal rosette formation is also noted. a capillary network was identified in between tumor cells in all the cases. one case had calcification with numerous psamomma bodies identified in the squash smear. background central neurocytomas are rare brain tumors recognized by their typical radiologic and histologic features. in general, a good prognosis is achieved by total removal. the histogenesis is still under debate, but a neuronal origin is widely assumed.   methods this study presents the clinical and immunohistologic findings of five patients and the results of cell culture experiments of two patients with central neurocytoma treated surgically between 1983 and 1993.   results the patient age at diagnosis ranged from 21 to 30 years (mean, 25 years). the male-to-female ration was 1:4. raised intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus was the main cause of the clinical manifestations. total resection was achieved in two cases. four patients received radiotherapy. one patient suffered a recurrence 1 year after surgery, requiring a second resection and radiotherapy. follow-up studies took place between 1 and 10.5 years (mean, 7.1 years). to date, all patients are free of their tumors. two patients suffered from permanent memory disturbances after surgery. immunohistochemistry confirmed the neuronal nature of the tumors. cell-culture studies, which have been carried out for the first time, demonstrated concomitant expression of neuronal (synaptophysin) and glial (gfap) markers.   conclusion total removal is the therapy of choice. in tumor recurrence or limited surgery (e.g. due to severe affliction of the fornical structures), radiotherapy has shown to be efficacious. the cell-culture experiments give new insight on the histogenesis of central neurocytoma, indicating that the tumor arises from an undifferentiated precursor cell with the capacity of bipotential neuroglial differentiation.
prostate cancer cells are dependent on androgen for growth and survival; as such, inhibition of androgen receptor (ar) activity is the first line of intervention for disseminated disease. recently, specific cytotoxic agents have been shown to extend survival times in patients with advanced disease. given the established ability of androgen to modify cell survival in prostate cancer cells, it is imperative to determine the effect of the hormonal environment on cytotoxic response. here, we show that the response of prostate cancer cells to taxane-induced cell death is significantly enhanced by androgen stimulation in ar-positive, androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. similar results were observed on androgen-independent ar activation. by contrast, ar-positive yet androgen-independent or ar-negative cells were refractory to androgen influence on taxane function. the ability of androgen to potentiate taxane activity was dependent on its mitogenic capacity and was separable from overall ar activity, as coadministration of ar antagonists, g(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, or high-dose (growth inhibitory) androgen nullified the proapoptotic function of androgen. observed induction of cell death was attributed to caspase-dependent apoptosis and correlated with p53 activation. combined, these data indicate that the cytotoxic effects of taxanes are substantially influenced by the hormonal environment and/or status of ar activity in prostate cancer cells and provide the foundation for refinement and optimization of cytotoxic intervention in prostate cancer. purpose the purpose is to identify gene expression patterns induced by docetaxelin head and neck squamous carcinoma (hnscc) cells using high throughput techniques.   experimental design hnscc cells were treated with docetaxel or solvent. after mrna extraction, cdna fluorescent (cy3 or cy5)-labeled probes were synthesized. then, cy3 and cy5-labeled samples were hybridized onto a microarray slide. the fluorescent images were scanned and analyzed for quantification. powerblot immunoblotting technique was used to measure protein expression level. using this dual approach, we focused on genes in established pathways (cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and signal transduction) of tumorigenesis and confirmed these results with conventional techniques.   results using cdna microarray, we found that docetaxel altered the expression of >100 genes in hnscc cells. a total of 153 of 1191 genes was found to have altered expression in either hn12 (n = 102), hn30 (n = 72), or both (n = 21) by docetaxel. for the powerblot analysis, a subset of genes (n = 46) in the cdna microarray analysis and an additional 98 genes in the cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and signal transduction pathways were chosen. we found that powerblot data agreed with cdna microarray in 65% of genes examined. the expression of a cell cycle inhibitor (p19) and promoters (cyclin a, cyclin b1, and cyclin e2f) were increased and decreased, respectively. apoptosis induced by docetaxel was independent of p53 and, in part, related to increased fas expression. both vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and basic fibroblast growth factor expression were inhibited by docetaxel, whereas thrombospondin-1 expression was increased by docetaxel. epidermal growth factor receptor, activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and activated c-jun nh(2)-terminal kinase expression was lowered by docetaxel. activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase was elevated by docetaxel, but not total extracellular signal-regulated kinase levels.   conclusions the identification of altered gene expression induced by docetaxel demonstrates additional biological activity in hnscc cells, and the altered expression of these genes may serve as potential biomarkers to both predict clinical activity and provide information regarding potential efficacy of adding novel agents.
huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a cag repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. the peripheral innate immune system contributes to huntington's disease pathogenesis and has been targeted successfully to modulate disease progression, but mechanistic understanding relating this to mutant huntingtin expression in immune cells has been lacking. here we demonstrate that human huntington's disease myeloid cells produce excessive inflammatory cytokines as a result of the cell-intrinsic effects of mutant huntingtin expression. a direct effect of mutant huntingtin on the nfκb pathway, whereby it interacts with ikkγ, leads to increased degradation of iκb and subsequent nuclear translocation of rela. transcriptional alterations in intracellular immune signalling pathways are also observed. using a novel method of small interfering rna delivery to lower huntingtin expression, we show reversal of disease-associated alterations in cellular function-the first time this has been demonstrated in primary human cells. glucan-encapsulated small interfering rna particles were used to lower huntingtin levels in human huntington's disease monocytes/macrophages, resulting in a reversal of huntingtin-induced elevated cytokine production and transcriptional changes. these findings improve our understanding of the role of innate immunity in neurodegeneration, introduce glucan-encapsulated small interfering rna particles as tool for studying cellular pathogenesis ex vivo in human cells and raise the prospect of immune cell-directed htt-lowering as a therapeutic in huntington's disease. nature genetics advance online publication we undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (gwas) of alzheimer’s disease (ad) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful ad gwas to date. in stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein e (apoe) locus (most significant snp, rs2075650, p = 1.8 × 10−157) and observed genome-wide significant association with snps at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the clu (also known as apoj) gene (rs11136000, p = 1.4 × 10−9) and 5 to the picalm gene (rs3851179, p = 1.9 × 10−8). these associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with alzheimer’s disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, p = 8.5 × 10−10, odds ratio = 0.86; rs3851179, p = 1.3 × 10−9, odds ratio = 0.86).
abstract previous surveys had evaluated the effects of the pd-1, ctla-4 gene polymorphisms on susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (as), but the results remained controversial. to briefly examine these consequences, a comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the relationships between pd-1 rs11568821, rs2227982, rs2227981, ctla-4 +49 a/g and −318 c/t polymorphisms and as risk. the available articles dated to december 2014 were searched in the pubmed, medline and embase databases. the data of the genotypes and/or alleles for the pd-1 rs11568821, rs2227982, rs2227981, ctla-4 +49 a/g and −318 c/t polymorphisms in the as and control subjects were extracted, and statistical analysis was conducted by stata 11.2 software. summary odds ratios (ors) with their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % cis) were calculated to determine the strength of associations with fixed-effects or random-effects models. a total of eight published studies were finally involved in this meta-analysis. meta-analysis of pd-1 rs2227982 polymorphism under the t allele versus c allele (or 1.744, 95 % ci 1.477–2.059, p < 0.0001), tt+tc versus cc (or 2.292, 95 % ci 1.654–3.175, p < 0.0001), tt versus cc (or 1.883, 95 % ci 1.299–2.729, p = 0.001) revealed a significant association with as. our meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs2227982 polymorphism in the pd-1 gene might contribute to as susceptibility. however, further studies with large sample sizes and among different ethnicity populations should be required to confirm this association. ankylosing spondylitis (as) is an autoimmune disease, and the imbalance of peripheral tolerance is involved in its pathogenesis. importantly, the negative signal of activated t cells plays a crucial role in the balance of peripheral tolerance. it has been postulated that human protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (ptpn22) and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen-4 (ctla-4) genes encode proteins that are actively involved in regulating t-cell activation. therefore, we evaluated the effects of ptpn22 and ctla-4 genotypes on the occurrence of as. genetic polymorphisms of ptpn22 -1123g/c and ctla-4 +49a/g were identified by polymerase chain reaction for 391 as patients and 391 healthy controls. subjects with ptpn22 cc and gc genotypes had a greater risk of as occurrence than those with ptpn22 gg genotype [relative risk = 1.39, 95 % confidence interval (95 % ci) 1.03–1.88]. further, subjects with ptpn22 cc/ctla-4 aa or ptpn22 gc/ctla-4 aa genotypes had 1.90-fold (95 % ci 1.02–3.49) greater risk of as development than those with other combinations of ptpn22 and ctla-4 genotypes. our findings indicated that ptpn22 -1123g/c and ctla-4 +49a/g genetic polymorphisms have a combined effect on the development of as.
piston stapes prostheses are implanted in patients with refractory conductive or mixed hearing loss due to stapes otosclerosis to stimulate the perilymph with varying degrees of success. the overclosure effect described by the majority of researchers affects mainly low and medium frequencies, and a large number of patients report a lack of satisfactory results for frequencies above 2 khz. the mechanics of perilymph stimulation with the piston have not been studied in a systematic manner. the objective of this study was to assess the influence of stapedotomy surgery on round window membrane vibration and to estimate the postoperative outcomes using the finite element (fe) method. the study hypothesis is that the three-dimensional fe model developed of the human inner ear, which simulates the round window (rw) membrane vibration, can be used to assess the influence of stapedotomy on auditory outcomes achieved after the surgical procedure. an additional objective of the study was to enable the simulation of rw membrane vibration after stapedotomy using a new type of stapes prosthesis currently under investigation at warsaw university of technology. a three-dimensional finite element (fe) model of the human inner ear was developed and validated using experimental data. the model was then used to simulate the round window membrane vibration before and after stapedotomy surgery. functional alterations of the rw membrane vibration were derived from the model and compared with the results of experimental measurements from temporal bones of a human cadaver. piston stapes prosthesis implantation causes an approximately fivefold (14 db) lower amplitude of the rw membrane vibrations compared with normal anatomical conditions. a satisfactory agreement between the fe model and the experimental data was found. the new prosthesis caused an increase of 20–30 db in the rw displacement amplitude compared with the 0.4-mm piston prosthesis. in all frequencies, the fe model predicted a rw displacement curve that was above the experimental curves for the normal ear. the stapedotomy can be well simulated by the fe model to predict the auditory outcomes achieved following this otosurgery procedure. the 3d fe model developed in this study may be used to optimize the geometry of a new type of stapes prosthesis in order to achieve a similar sound transmission through the inner ear as for a normal middle ear. this should provide better auditory outcomes for patients with stapedial otosclerosis. the fluids in the cochlea are normally considered incompressible, and the fluid volume displacement of the oval window (ow) and the round window (rw) should be equal and of opposite phase. however, other channels, such as the cochlear and vestibular aqueducts, may affect the fluid flow. to test if the ow and rw fluid flows are equal and of opposite phase, the volume displacement was assessed by multiple point measurement at the windows with a laser doppler vibrometer. this was done during air conduction (ac) stimulation in seven fresh human temporal bones, and with bone conduction (bc) stimulation in eight temporal bones and one human cadaver head. with ac stimulation, the average volume displacement of the two windows is within 3 db, and the phase difference is close to 180 degrees for the frequency range 0.1 to 10 khz. with bc stimulation, the average volume displacement difference between the two windows is greater: below 2 khz, the volume displacement at the rw is 5 to 15 db greater than at the ow and above 2 khz more fluid is displaced at the ow. with bc stimulation, lesions at the ow caused only minor changes of the fluid flow at the rw.
