the effects of tio2 nanodot films with rgd immobilization on light-induced cell sheet technology the phenomenon of light-induced cell detachment is reported. mouse calvaria-derived, pre-osteoblastic (mc3t3-e1) cells were cultured on a tio(2) nanodot-coated quartz substrate. after 20 min of uv365 illumination, over 90% of the cells would detach from the surface. moreover, intact cell sheets could be obtained in the same way. it was found that the as-obtained cells showed good viability, and could be used for further culture processes and other applications. also, biocompatibility and safety characterizations indicated that the use of tio(2) nanodots and uv365 illumination was safe for such cell detachment. it is suggested that adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins play key roles in developing cell sheets and ensuring biocompatibility. the present light-induced cell detachment method demonstrates a promising way for rapid cell/cell sheet harvesting.
a texture dictionary for human organs tissues’ classification snakes, or active contours, are used extensively in computer vision and image processing applications, particularly to locate object boundaries. problems associated with initialization and poor convergence to concave boundaries, however, have limited their utility. this paper develops a new external force for active contours, largely solving both problems. this external force, which we call gradient vector flow (gvf) is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image. the resultant field has a large capture range and forces active contours into concave regions. examples on simulated images and one real image are presented.
allele-specific differences in transcriptome, mirnome, and mitochondrial function in two hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mouse models. objectives we investigated cardiac energetics in subjects with mutations in three different familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) disease genes, some of whom were nonpenetrant carriers without hypertrophy, using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.   background familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by mutations in sarcomeric protein genes. the mechanism by which these mutant proteins cause disease is uncertain. a defect of myocyte contractility had been proposed, but in vitro studies of force generation have subsequently shown opposing results in different classes of mutation. an alternative hypothesis of "energy compromise" resulting from inefficient utilization of adenosine triphosphate (atp) has been suggested, but in vivo data in humans with genotyped hcm are lacking.   methods the cardiac phosphocreatine (pcr) to atp ratio was determined at rest in 31 patients harboring mutations in the genes for either beta-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin t, or myosin-binding protein c, and in 24 controls. transthoracic echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular (lv) dimensions and maximal wall thickness.   results the pcr/atp was reduced in the hcm subjects by 30% relative to controls (1.70 +/- 0.43 vs. 2.44 +/- 0.30; p < 0.001), and the reduction was of a similar magnitude in all three disease-gene groups. the pcr/atp was equally reduced in subjects with (n = 24) and without (n = 7) lv hypertrophy.   conclusions our data provide evidence of a bioenergetic deficit in genotype-confirmed hcm, which is present to a similar degree in three disease-gene groups. the presence of energetic abnormalities, even in those without hypertrophy, supports a proposed link between altered cardiac energetics and development of the disease phenotype.
improving eye motion sequence recognition using electrooculography based on context-dependent hmm we present benchmark results of automatic speech recognition using the corpus of spontaneous japanese (csj), which has been developed in the five-year national project and will be the largest spontaneous speech databases. new test-sets are designed for both academic presentation speech and extemporaneous public speech, which are the two major categories in the corpus. the testsets are selected to cover the variation of acoustic and linguistic factors in spontaneous speech: word perplexity, degree of disfluency, and the speaking rate. baseline acoustic and language models are set up using an almost complete set (500 hours and 6.67m words) of the csj. statistical modeling of pronunciation variation is also incorporated into the language model based on the alignment of large-scale transcriptions. the benchmark results verified the effects of the factors considered in the test-set design.
models for improved tractability and accuracy in dependency parsing we present experiments with a dependency parsing model defined on rich factors. our model represents dependency trees with factors that include three types of relations between the tokens of a dependency and their children. we extend the projective parsing algorithm of eisner (1996) for our case, and train models using the averaged perceptron. our experiments show that considering higher-order information yields significant improvements in parsing accuracy, but comes at a high cost in terms of both time and memory consumption. in the multilingual exercise of the conll-2007 shared task (nivre et al., 2007), our system obtains the best accuracy for english, and the second best accuracies for basque and czech.
early blood glucose profile and neurodevelopmental outcome at two years in neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy aims: to examine the predictive value of early developmental testing for identifying neuromotor and perceptual-motor impairment at school age in children with neonatal encephalopathy (ne). methods: eighty full term infants with ne were followed longitudinally. where possible, children were tested on the griffiths scales at 1 and 2 years and at 5–6 years, on the touwen examination, movement abc, and wppsi. the relation between the griffiths scores and later outcome measures was examined using correlation coefficients and sensitivity and specificity values. results: by 2 years, 25 children with cerebral palsy were too severely impaired to be formally assessed and remained so at 5–6 years. abnormal griffiths scores were obtained by 12% and 7% of the children at 1 and 2 years respectively. at 5–6 years, 33% had poor movement abc scores and 15% poor wppsi scores. the highest correlation between griffiths scores and the outcome measures was for the movement abc (0.72), although this accounted for only 50% of the variance. sensitivity scores for the movement abc were below 70% but specificity was 100%. conclusions: a poor score on the griffiths scales at 1 and/or 2 years is a good predictor of impairment at school age. however, a normal score in the early years cannot preclude later neurological, perceptual-motor, or cognitive abnormalities.
closed-form solutions for options in incomplete markets february , 2013 in this paper we study both market risks and nonmarket risks, without complete markets assumption, and discuss methods of measurement of these risks. we present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." we examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by span, by the sec/nasd rules, and by quantile-based methods. we demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. we offer suggestions concerning the sec method. we also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods. copyright blackwell publishers inc 1999.
geographical variation in health-related physical fitness and body composition among chilean 8th graders: a nationally representative cross-sectional study there is increasing interest in estimating and drawing inferences about risk or prevalence ratios and differences instead of odds ratios in the regression setting. recent publications have shown how the genmod procedure in sas (sas institute inc., cary, north carolina) can be used to estimate these parameters in non-population-based studies. in this paper, the authors show how model-adjusted risks, risk differences, and risk ratio estimates can be obtained directly from logistic regression models in the complex sample survey setting to yield population-based inferences. complex sample survey designs typically involve some combination of weighting, stratification, multistage sampling, clustering, and perhaps finite population adjustments. point estimates of model-adjusted risks, risk differences, and risk ratios are obtained from average marginal predictions in the fitted logistic regression model. the model can contain both continuous and categorical covariates, as well as interaction terms. the authors use the sudaan software package (research triangle institute, research triangle park, north carolina) to obtain point estimates, standard errors (via linearization or a replication method), confidence intervals, and p values for the parameters and contrasts of interest. data from the 2006 national health interview survey are used to illustrate these concepts.
associations between attributes of live poultry trade and hpai h5n1 outbreaks: a descriptive and network analysis study in northern vietnam the objectives of this study were to describe the spatio-temporal pattern of an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) in vietnam and to identify potential risk factors for the introduction and maintenance of infection within the poultry population. the results indicate that during the time period 2004-early 2006 a sequence of three epidemic waves occurred in vietnam as distinct spatial and temporal clusters. the risk of outbreak occurrence increased with a greater percentage of rice paddy fields, increasing domestic water bird and chicken density. it increased with reducing distance to higher population density aggregations, and in the third epidemic wave with increasing percentage of aquaculture. the findings indicate that agri-livestock farming systems involving domestic water birds and rice production in river delta areas are important for the maintenance and spread of infection. while the government's control measures appear to have been effective in the south and central parts of vietnam, it is likely that in the north of vietnam the vaccination campaign led to transmission of infection which was subsequently brought under control.
augmentation with silicone stabilizes proximal femur fractures: an in vitro biomechanical study. unlabelled to assess age-related changes in femoral strength as a component in the risk of fracture of the hip, we compared the loads at fracture of the proximal aspects of femora from the cadavera of older and younger individuals, as tested in a fall-loading configuration. to provide a basis for non-invasive in vivo estimates of femoral strength, we also determined the correlations between variables measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and these loads. femora from the cadavera of eight older individuals (mean age, seventy-four years) and nine younger individuals (mean age, thirty-three years) were scanned with a hologic qdr-2000 densitometer to obtain densitometric and geometric information. the femora were then tested mechanically in a loading configuration that simulated a fall on the greater trochanter. the femora from the older group were half as strong as those from the younger group (p < 0.001), and they absorbed one-third as much energy (p < 0.001). the area bone-mineral density of the femoral neck correlated strongly with the load at fracture (r2 = 0.92).   clinical relevance the prevalence of fracture of the hip increases exponentially with age. 90 percent of those fractures are the result of a simple fall from a standing height.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
the peroxin pex34p functions with the pex11 family of peroxisomal divisional proteins to regulate the peroxisome population in yeast the abundance and size of cellular organelles vary depending on the cell type and metabolic needs. peroxisomes constitute a class of cellular organelles renowned for their ability to adapt to cellular and environmental conditions. together with transcriptional regulators, two groups of peroxisomal proteins have a pronounced influence on peroxisome size and abundance. pex11‐type peroxisome proliferators are involved in the proliferation of peroxisomes, defined here as an increase in size and/or number of peroxisomes. dynamin‐related proteins have recently been suggested to be required for the scission of peroxisomal membranes. this review surveys the function of pex11‐type peroxisome proliferators and dynamin‐related proteins in peroxisomal proliferation and division.
deep phylogenetic analysis of haplogroup g1 provides estimates of snp and str mutation rates on the human y-chromosome and reveals migrations of iranic speakers markers on the non-recombining portion of the human y chromosome continue to have applications in many fields including evolutionary biology, forensics, medical genetics, and genealogical reconstruction. in 2002, the y chromosome consortium published a single parsimony tree showing the relationships among 153 haplogroups based on 243 binary markers and devised a standardized nomenclature system to name lineages nested within this tree. here we present an extensively revised y chromosome tree containing 311 distinct haplogroups, including two new major haplogroups (s and t), and incorporating approximately 600 binary markers. we describe major changes in the topology of the parsimony tree and provide names for new and rearranged lineages within the tree following the rules presented by the y chromosome consortium in 2002. several changes in the tree topology have important implications for studies of human ancestry. we also present demography-independent age estimates for 11 of the major clades in the new y chromosome tree.
provable self-representation based outlier detection in a union of subspaces we present a generative appearance-based method for recognizing human faces under variation in lighting and viewpoint. our method exploits the fact that the set of images of an object in fixed pose, but under all possible illumination conditions, is a convex cone in the space of images. using a small number of training images of each face taken with different lighting directions, the shape and albedo of the face can be reconstructed. in turn, this reconstruction serves as a generative model that can be used to render (or synthesize) images of the face under novel poses and illumination conditions. the pose space is then sampled and, for each pose, the corresponding illumination cone is approximated by a low-dimensional linear subspace whose basis vectors are estimated using the generative model. our recognition algorithm assigns to a test image the identity of the closest approximated illumination cone. test results show that the method performs almost without error, except on the most extreme lighting directions.

carhta gene: multipopulation integrated genetic and radiation hybrid mapping this paper discusses a highly effective heuristic procedure for generating optimum and near-optimum solutions for the symmetric traveling-salesman problem. the procedure is based on a general approach to heuristics that is believed to have wide applicability in combinatorial optimization problems. the procedure produces optimum solutions for all problems tested, "classical" problems appearing in the literature, as well as randomly generated test problems, up to 110 cities. run times grow approximately as n2; in absolute terms, a typical 100-city problem requires less than 25 seconds for one case ge635, and about three minutes to obtain the optimum with above 95 per cent confidence.
cobrapy: constraints-based reconstruction and analysis for python cellular response to genetic and environmental perturbations is often reflected and/or mediated through changes in the metabolism, because the latter plays a key role in providing gibbs free energy and precursors for biosynthesis. such metabolic changes are often exerted through transcriptional changes induced by complex regulatory mechanisms coordinating the activity of different metabolic pathways. it is difficult to map such global transcriptional responses by using traditional methods, because many genes in the metabolic network have relatively small changes at their transcription level. we therefore developed an algorithm that is based on hypothesis-driven data analysis to uncover the transcriptional regulatory architecture of metabolic networks. by using information on the metabolic network topology from genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, we show that it is possible to reveal patterns in the metabolic network that follow a common transcriptional response. thus, the algorithm enables identification of so-called reporter metabolites (metabolites around which the most significant transcriptional changes occur) and a set of connected genes with significant and coordinated response to genetic or environmental perturbations. we find that cells respond to perturbations by changing the expression pattern of several genes involved in the specific part(s) of the metabolism in which a perturbation is introduced. these changes then are propagated through the metabolic network because of the highly connected nature of metabolism.
implementing person-centered care in a general medical clinic: cultural barriers and driving forces the resistance to change scale was designed to measure an individual's dispositional inclination to resist changes. in study 1, exploratory analyses indicated 4 reliable factors: routine seeking, emotional reaction to imposed change, cognitive rigidity, and short-term focus. studies 2, 3, and 4 confirmed this structure and demonstrated the scale's convergent and discriminant validities. studies 5, 6, and 7 demonstrated the concurrent and predictive validities of the scale in 3 distinct contexts. the scale can be used to account for the individual-difference component of resistance to change and to predict reactions to specific change.
does impaired executive functioning differentially impact verbal memory measures in older adults with suspected dementia? this study was undertaken to determine the ability of the wechsler memory scale-revised (wms-r) to differentiate a group of closed head injury patients from a group of controls and determine how injury severity and attentional deficits are associated with wms-r performance. the relationship of wms-r performance to everyday memory also was assessed. the head injured group performed more poorly than controls on all five wms-r indices and exhibited greater impairments on tasks that measure retention. in the original sample only the visual memory index correlated with injury severity; in a larger sample, all four memory indices correlated modestly with injury severity. patients who performed more poorly on the wms-r also received poorer ratings on an independent assessment of everyday memory.
spatial scaling of environmental variables improves species-habitat models of fishes in a small, sand-bed lowland river the objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether the presence or absence of prairie fishes can be modelled using habitat and biotic characteristics measured at the reach and catchment scales and (2) to identify which scale (i.e. reach, catchment or a combination of variables measured at both scales) best explains the presence or absence of fishes. reach and catchment information from 120 sites sampled from 1999 to 2004 were incorporated into tree classifiers for 20 prairie fish species, and multiple criteria were used to evaluate models. fewer than six models were considered significant when modelling individual fish occurrences at the reach, catchment or combined scale, and only one species was successfully modelled at all three scales. the scarcity of significant models is probably related to the rigorous criteria by which these models were evaluated as well as the prevalence of tolerant, generalist fishes in these stochastic and intermittent streams. no significant differences in the amount of reduced deviance, mean misclassification error rates (mer), and mean improvement in mer metrics was detected among the three scales. results from this study underscore the importance of continued habitat assessment at smaller scales to further understand prairie-fish occurrences as well as further evaluations of modelling methods to examine habitat relationships for tolerant, ubiquitous species. incorporation of such suggestions in the future may help provide more accurate models that will allow for better management and conservation of prairie-fish species.
identification of a small molecule that facilitates the differentiation of human ipscs/escs and mouse embryonic pancreatic explants into pancreatic endocrine cells nuclear reprogramming of somatic tissue enables derivation of induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells from an autologous, non-embryonic origin. the purpose of this study was to establish efficient protocols for lineage specification of human ips cells into functional glucose-responsive, insulin-producing progeny. we generated human ips cells, which were then guided with recombinant growth factors that mimic the essential signaling for pancreatic development. reprogrammed with four stemness factors, human fibroblasts were here converted into authentic ips cells. under feeder-free conditions, fate specification was initiated with activin a and wnt3a that triggered engagement into definitive endoderm, followed by priming with fibroblast growth factor 10 (fgf10) and kaad-cyclopamine. addition of retinoic acid, boosted by the pancreatic endoderm inducer indolactam v (ilv), yielded pancreatic progenitors expressing pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (pdx1), neurogenin 3 (ngn3) and neurogenic differentiation 1 (neurod1) markers. further guidance, under insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1), hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) and n-[n-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-s-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (dapt), was enhanced by glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) to generate islet-like cells that expressed pancreas-specific markers including insulin and glucagon. derived progeny demonstrated sustained expression of pdx1, and functional responsiveness to glucose challenge secreting up to 230 pm of c-peptide. a pancreatogenic cocktail enriched with ilv/glp-1 offers a proficient means to specify human ips cells into glucose-responsive hormone-producing progeny, refining the development of a personalized platform for islet-like cell generation.
additive prognostic value of the syntax score over grace, timi, zwolle, cadillac and pami risk scores in patients with acute st-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention this paper presents a general statistical methodology for the analysis of multivariate categorical data arising from observer reliability studies. the procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. these procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.
radiation doses to emergency department patients undergoing computed tomography. a review of patient doses from ct examinations in the uk for 2003 has been conducted on the basis of data received from over a quarter of all uk scanners, of which 37% had multislice capability. questionnaires were employed to collect scan details both for the standard protocols established at each scanner for 12 common types of ct examination on adults and children, and for samples of individual patients. this information was combined with published scanner-specific ct dose index (ctdi) coefficients to estimate values of the standard dose indices ctdi(w) and ctdi(vol) for each scan sequence. knowledge of each scan length allowed assessment of the dose-length product (dlp) for each examination, from which effective doses were then estimated. when compared with a previous uk survey for 1991, wide variations were still apparent between ct centres in the doses for standard protocols. the mean uk doses for adult patients were in general lower by up to 50% than those for 1991, although doses were slightly higher for multislice (4+) (msct) relative to single slice (ssct) scanners. values of ctdi(vol) for msct were broadly similar to european survey data for 2001. the third quartile values of these dose distributions have been used to derive uk national reference doses for examinations on adults (separately for ssct and msct) and children as initial tools for promoting patient protection. the survey has established the predict (patient radiation exposure and dose in ct) database as a sustainable national resource for monitoring dose trends in ct through the ongoing collation of further survey data.
poppy crop height and capsule volume estimation from a single uas flight sensor miniaturisation, improved battery technology and the availability of low-cost yet advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (uav) have provided new opportunities for environmental remote sensing. the uav provides a platform for close-range aerial photography. detailed imagery captured from micro-uav can produce dense point clouds using multi-view stereopsis (mvs) techniques combining photogrammetry and computer vision. this study applies mvs techniques to imagery acquired from a multi-rotor micro-uav of a natural coastal site in southeastern tasmania, australia. a very dense point cloud ( < 1–3 cm point spacing) is produced in an arbitrary coordinate system using full resolution imagery, whereas other studies usually downsample the original imagery. the point cloud is sparse in areas of complex vegetation and where surfaces have a homogeneous texture. ground control points collected with differential global positioning system (dgps) are identified and used for georeferencing via a helmert transformation. this study compared georeferenced point clouds to a total station survey in order to assess and quantify their geometric accuracy. the results indicate that a georeferenced point cloud accurate to 25–40 mm can be obtained from imagery acquired from ~50 m. uav-based image capture provides the spatial and temporal resolution required to map and monitor natural landscapes. this paper assesses the accuracy of the generated point clouds based on field survey points. based on our key findings we conclude that sub-decimetre terrain change (in this case coastal erosion) can be monitored.
ensembles of lasso screening rules we investigate fast methods that allow to quickly eliminate variables (features) in supervised learning problems involving a convex loss function and a $l_1$-norm penalty, leading to a potentially substantial reduction in the number of variables prior to running the supervised learning algorithm. the methods are not heuristic: they only eliminate features that are {\em guaranteed} to be absent after solving the learning problem. our framework applies to a large class of problems, including support vector machine classification, logistic regression and least-squares.  the complexity of the feature elimination step is negligible compared to the typical computational effort involved in the sparse supervised learning problem: it grows linearly with the number of features times the number of examples, with much better count if data is sparse. we apply our method to data sets arising in text classification and observe a dramatic reduction of the dimensionality, hence in computational effort required to solve the learning problem, especially when very sparse classifiers are sought. our method allows to immediately extend the scope of existing algorithms, allowing us to run them on data sets of sizes that were out of their reach before.
the value of circulating nogo-b for evaluating hepatic functional reserve in patients with cirrhosis cirrhosis is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in more developed countries, being the 14th most common cause of death worldwide but fourth in central europe. increasingly, cirrhosis has been seen to be not a single disease entity, but one that can be subclassified into distinct clinical prognostic stages, with 1-year mortality ranging from 1% to 57% depending on the stage. we review the current understanding of cirrhosis as a dynamic process and outline current therapeutic options for prevention and treatment of complications of cirrhosis, on the basis of the subclassification in clinical stages. the new concept in management of patients with cirrhosis should be prevention and early intervention to stabilise disease progression and to avoid or delay clinical decompensation and the need for liver transplantation. the challenge in the 21st century is to prevent the need for liver transplantation in as many patients with cirrhosis as possible.
learning discriminative space-time actions from weakly labelled videos detecting humans in films and videos is a challenging problem owing to the motion of the subjects, the camera and the background and to variations in pose, appearance, clothing, illumination and background clutter. we develop a detector for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds, testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. these motion-based descriptors are combined with our histogram of oriented gradient appearance descriptors. the resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. we validate our results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. the combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000 windows tested at 8% miss rate on our test set 1.
choline partially prevents the impact of ethanol on the lipid raft dependent functions of l1 cell adhesion molecule. inhibition of the functions of l1 cell adhesion molecule (l1) by ethanol has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the neurodevelopmental aspects of the fetal alcohol syndrome (fas). ethanol at pharmacological concentrations has been shown to inhibit l1‐mediated neurite outgrowth of rat post‐natal day 6 cerebellar granule cells (cgn). extracellular signal‐related kinases (erk) 1/2 activation occurs following l1 clustering. reduction in phosphoerk1/2 by inhibition of mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase (mek) reduces neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons. here, we examine the effects of ethanol on l1 activation of erk1/2, and whether this activation occurs via activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (fgfr1). ethanol at 25 mm markedly inhibited erk1/2 activation by both clustering l1 with cross‐linked monoclonal antibodies, or by l1‐fc chimeric proteins. clustering l1 with subsequent erk1/2 activation did not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of the fgfr1. in addition, inhibition of fgfr1 tyrosine kinase blocked basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) activation of erk1/2, but did not affect activation of erk1/2 by clustered l1. we conclude that ethanol disrupts the signaling pathway between l1 clustering and erk1/2 activation, and that this occurs independently of the fgfr1 pathway in cerebellar granule cells.
secure transmission and self-energy recycling with partial eavesdropper csi we consider a dual-hop full-duplex relaying system, where the energy constrained relay node is powered by radio frequency signals from the source using the time-switching architecture, both the amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying protocols are studied. specifically, we provide an analytical characterization of the achievable throughput of three different communication modes, namely, instantaneous transmission, delay-constrained transmission, and delay tolerant transmission. in addition, the optimal time split is studied for different transmission modes. our results reveal that, when the time split is optimized, the full-duplex relaying could substantially boost the system throughput compared to the conventional half-duplex relaying architecture for all three transmission modes. in addition, it is shown that the instantaneous transmission mode attains the highest throughput. however, compared to the delay-constrained transmission mode, the throughput gap is rather small. unlike the instantaneous time split optimization which requires instantaneous channel state information, the optimal time split in the delay-constrained transmission mode depends only on the statistics of the channel, hence, is suitable for practical implementations.
linear networks based speaker adaptation for speech synthesis in dnn-based tts synthesis, dnns hidden layers can be viewed as deep transformation for linguistic features and the output layers as representation of acoustic space to regress the transformed linguistic features to acoustic parameters. the deep-layered architectures of dnn can not only represent highly-complex transformation compactly, but also take advantage of huge amount of training data. in this paper, we propose an approach to model multiple speakers tts with a general dnn, where the same hidden layers are shared among different speakers while the output layers are composed of speaker-dependent nodes explaining the target of each speaker. the experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve the quality of synthesized speech objectively and subjectively, comparing with speech synthesized from the individual, speaker-dependent dnn-based tts. we further transfer the hidden layers for a new speaker with limited training data and the resultant synthesized speech of the new speaker can also achieve a good quality in term of naturalness and speaker similarity.
learning random kernel approximations for object recognition recent advances in multiple kernel learning (mkl) have positioned it as an attractive tool for tackling many supervised learning tasks. the development of efficient gradient descent based optimization schemes has made it possible to tackle large scale problems. simultaneously, mkl based algorithms have achieved very good results on challenging real world applications. yet, despite their successes, mkl approaches are limited in that they focus on learning a linear combination of given base kernels.  in this paper, we observe that existing mkl formulations can be extended to learn general kernel combinations subject to general regularization. this can be achieved while retaining all the efficiency of existing large scale optimization algorithms. to highlight the advantages of generalized kernel learning, we tackle feature selection problems on benchmark vision and uci databases. it is demonstrated that the proposed formulation can lead to better results not only as compared to traditional mkl but also as compared to state-of-the-art wrapper and filter methods for feature selection.
the retraction algorithm for factoring banded symmetric matrices the bunch-kaufman factorization is widely accepted as the algorithm of choice for the direct solution of symmetric indefinite linear equations; it is the algorithm employed in both linpack and lapack. it has also been adapted to sparse symmetric indefinite linear systems.  while the bunch--kaufman factorization is normwise backward stable, its factors can have unusual scaling, with entries bounded by terms depending both on |a| and on $\kappa(a)$. this scaling, combined with the block nature of the algorithm, may degrade the accuracy of computed solutions unnecessarily. overlooking the lack of a triangular factor bound leads to a further complication in lapack such that the lapack bunch--kaufman factorization can be unstable.  we present two alternative algorithms, close cousins of the bunch-kaufman factorization, for solving dense symmetric indefinite systems. both share the positive attributes of the bunch-kaufman algorithm but provide better accuracy by bounding the triangular factors. the price of higher accuracy can be kept low by choosing between our two algorithms. one is appropriate as the replacement for the blocked lapack bunch-kaufman factorization; the other would replace the linpack-like unblocked factorization in lapack.  solving sparse symmetric indefinite systems is more problematic. we conclude that the bunch-kaufman algorithm cannot be rescued effectively in the sparse case. imposing the constraint of bounding the triangular factors leads naturally to one particular version of the duff-reid algorithm, which we show gives better accuracy than liu's sparse variant of the bunch-kaufman algorithm. we extend the work of duff and reid in two respects that often provide higher efficiency: a more effective procedure for finding pivot blocks and a stable extension to pivot blocks of size larger than two.
discovering interesting information with advances in web technology there is a great deal of research on ontology integration which makes use of rich logical constraints to reason about the structural and logical alignment of ontologies. there is also considerable work on matching data instances from heterogeneous schema or ontologies. however, little work exploits the fact that ontologies include both data and structure. we aim to close this gap by presenting a new algorithm (iliads) that tightly integrates both data matching and logical reasoning to achieve better matching of ontologies. we evaluate our algorithm on a set of 30 pairs of owl lite ontologies with the schema and data matchings found by human reviewers. we compare against two systems - the ontology matching tool fca-merge [28] and the schema matching tool coma++ [1]. iliads shows an average improvement of 25% in quality over fca-merge and a 11% improvement in recall over coma++.
hedgehog pathway blockade with the cancer drug lde225 disrupts taste organs and taste sensation. cuff electrodes with headcap connectors were implanted around the rat chorda tympani nerve. whole nerve recordings under anesthesia were made from these nerves every week to chemical, thermal and tactile stimuli applied to the anterior tongue. the signal/noise ratio of these recordings was similar to acute recordings from the chorda tympani nerve, and the nerves were spontaneously active. responses to chemical as well as thermal and mechanical stimulation of the tongue were recorded as early as 2 and 3 weeks after implantation and recordings from the same nerve were made for more than 3 months. these results have demonstrated the feasibility of making long-term chronic recordings of chemosensory activity in the chorda tympani nerve. the cuff electrode has great potential to provide correlative information between neurophysiological and behavioral data.
role of e-cadherin gene in gall bladder cancer and its precursor lesions american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) staging procedures were first published in 1977. since 1991 the commission on cancer (coc) has required ajcc staging of all nonpediatric cancers. the national cancer data base (ncdb) encouraged recording of ajcc staging through analyses of selected aspects of staging completeness. we reviewed the trend toward the adoption of routine ajcc staging by hospitals for the 5‐year period 1990‐1994.
the healthy nordic diet and incidence of type 2 diabetes--10-year follow-up. objective the health-related effects of the nordic diet remain mostly unidentified. we created a baltic sea diet score (bsds) for epidemiological research to indicate adherence to a healthy nordic diet. we examined associations between the score and nutrient intakes that are considered important in promoting public health. we also examined the performance of the bsds under two different cut-off strategies.   design the cross-sectional study included two phases of the national finrisk 2007 study. diet was assessed using a validated ffq. food and nutrient intakes were calculated using in-house software. nine components were selected for the score. each component was scored according to both sex-specific consumption quartiles (bsds-q) and medians (bsds-m), and summed to give the final score values.   setting a large representative sample of the finnish population.   subjects men (n 2217) and women (n 2493) aged 25 to 74 years.   results in the age- and energy-adjusted model, adherence to the diet was associated with a higher intake of carbohydrates (e%), and lower intakes of sfa (e%) and alcohol (e%, where e% is percentage of total energy intake; p < 0·01). furthermore, the intakes of fibre, fe, vitamins a, c and d, and folate were higher among participants who adhered to the diet (p < 0·05). after further adjustments, the results remained significant (p < 0·05) and did not differ remarkably between bsds-q and bsds-m.   conclusions the bsds can be used as a measure of a healthy nordic diet to assess diet-health relationships in public health surveys in nordic countries.
inefficiency in self-organized attentional switching in the normal aging population is associated with decreased activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex despite numerous functional neuroimaging and lesion studies of human executive function, the precise neuroanatomical correlates of specific components of attentional control remain controversial. using a novel approach that focused upon volunteer behavior rather than experimental manipulations, specific components of attentional shifting were fractionated, and their neural correlates differentiated using event-related fmri. the results demonstrate that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in switching attention "between" stimulus dimensions, whereas the posterior parietal cortex mediates changes in stimulus-response mapping. furthermore, reversals based on negative feedback activated the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, whereas positive feedback modulated activity in the medial orbital frontal cortex. finally, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was active throughout solution search. these findings support the hypothesis that lateral prefrontal, orbital, and parietal areas form a supervisory network that controls the focus of attention and suggests that these regions can be fractionated in terms of their specific contributions.
enhancing quality in diffusion tensor imaging with anisotropic anomalous diffusion filter to compare the effects of anisotropic and gaussian smoothing on the outcomes of diffusion tensor imaging (dti) voxel‐based (vb) analyses in the clinic, in terms of signal‐to‐noise ratio (snr) enhancement and directional information and boundary structures preservation.
effect of antioxidant mineral elements supplementation in the treatment of hypertension in albino rats the goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress in dahl salt-sensitive (ss) rats on a high-sodium intake contributes to the progression of renal damage, the decreases in renal hemodynamics, and the development of hypertension. we specifically studied whether antioxidant therapy, using vitamins c and e, could help prevent renal damage and glomerular filtration rate (gfr) and renal plasma flow reductions and attenuate the increases in arterial pressure. thirty-three 7- to 8-week old dahl ss/rapp strain rats were placed on either a high-sodium (8%) or a low-sodium (0.3%) diet with or without vitamin e (111 iu/d) in the food and 98 mg/d vitamin c in the drinking water for 5 weeks. rats were equipped with indwelling arterial and venous catheters at day 21. by day 35 in the rats with high-sodium diet, vitamin c and e treatment significantly decreased renal cortical and medullary &ov0151; release, mean arterial pressure, urinary protein excretion, glomerular necrosis, and renal tubulointerstitial damage. at this time, gfr significantly decreased in the high-sodium diet group (1.6±0.2 ml/min) when compared with either the high-sodium plus vitamins c and e (2.9±0.2 ml/min) or the low-sodium diet group (2.9±0.3 ml/min). in ss rats on high-sodium diet, renal plasma flow decreased 40%, and this reduced flow was restored by vitamin treatment. in dahl salt-sensitive hypertension, increased oxidative stress plays an important role in the renal damage, decreases in renal hemodynamics, and increases in arterial pressure that occur. antioxidant treatment with vitamins c and e improves renal dysfunction, lessens renal injury, and decreases arterial pressure in dahl salt-sensitive hypertension.
assessment of myocardial repolarisation parameters in patients with familial mediterranean fever objectives our objective in this study was to evaluate tpeak-tend interval (tp-e) and other electrocardiographic parameters as risk factors for recurrence of life-threatening cardiac events in patients with the brugada syndrome (bs).   background the tp-e interval in the electrocardiogram (ecg) has been reported to predict life-threatening arrhythmias in the long qt syndrome.   methods twenty-nine patients with the ecg pattern of bs and 29 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were studied. the follow-up period was 42.65 +/- 24.42 months (range 11 to 108 months).   results upon presentation, five patients had suffered aborted sudden death, five syncope, and two presyncope. eleven patients with the ecg pattern of bs had a prolonged (>460 ms) qtc in v2 but usually not in inferior or left leads. no patient had abnormally prolonged qt dispersion. programmed electrical stimulation induced ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 5 out of 26 patients. inducibility did not predict recurrence of events. cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted in 14 patients (all symptomatic and two asymptomatic). during follow-up, nine symptomatic patients experienced recurrences. previous cardiac events and a qtc >460 ms in v2 were significant risk factors (p = 0.00002 and p = 0.03, respectively). tp-e and tp-e dispersion were significantly prolonged in patients with recurrences versus patients without events (104.4 and 35.6 ms vs. 87.4 and 23.2 ms; p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively) or controls (90.7 and 17.9 ms; p = 0.02 and p = 0.001, respectively).   conclusions our study demonstrates significant correlation between previous events, qtc >460 ms in v2, tp-e, and tp-e dispersion and occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmic events, suggesting that these parameters may be useful in risk stratification of patients with the brugada syndrome.
a nuclear role for the respiratory enzyme clk-1/coq7 in regulating mitochondrial stress responses and longevity inactivation of the caenorhabditis elegans gene clk-1, which is required for ubiquinone biosynthesis, increases lifespan by an insulin signaling-independent mechanism. we find that homozygous inactivation of mclk1, the mouse ortholog of clk-1, yields es cells that are protected from oxidative stress and damage to dna. moreover, in the livers of old mclk1(+/-) mice, hepatocytes that have lost mclk1 expression by loss of heterozygosity undergo clonal expansion, suggesting that their resistance to stress allows them to outcompete cells that still express the gene. mclk1(+/-) mice, whose growth and fertility are normal, also display a substantial increase in lifespan in each of three different genetic backgrounds. these observations indicate that the distinct mechanism by which clk-1/mclk1 affects lifespan is evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to mammals and is not tied to a particular anatomy or physiology.
scent of a nest: discrimination of own-nest odours in antarctic prions, pachyptila desolata like many other species of petrel, blue petrel (halobaena caerulea) are able to return to their nest burrows at night in complete darkness. since petrels have a well-developed olfactory system, we carried out an experiment to test whether blue petrels use olfaction to localise their nest burrows. incubating birds were injected intranasally with a zinc sulphate solution, which reversibly impairs the sensitivity of the olfactory mucosa; control birds were treated with physiological saline solution. none of the anosmic birds returned to their burrows, whereas all the birds treated with saline solution did. our results suggest that olfactory cues are necessary for blue petrels to find their burrows.
differential effects of 5,6-eet on segmental pulmonary vasoactivity in the rabbit. we investigated the effect of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-hete), an arachidonic acid metabolite of the cytochrome p-450 (cp450) 4a pathway, on human pulmonary arterial tone. 20-hete elicited a dose-dependent and indomethacin-inhibitable vasodilation of isolated small pulmonary arteries. whole lung microsomes metabolized [24c]arachidonic acid into 20-hete and a variety of leukotrienes, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, and prostanoids. indomethacin blocked formation of prostanoids without effects on the conversion of arachidonate into 20-hete, 20-hete was converted by lung microsomes into prostanoids, raising the possibility that 20-hete may be metabolized by cyclooxygenase enzymes in vascular tissue to a vasodilatory compound. western blots probed with a polyclonal antibody to cp450 4a identified a protein of approximately 50 kda immunologically similar to the cp450 4a in rat liver. we conclude that small arteries from human lungs dilate upon exposure to 20-hete in a cyclooxygenase-dependent manner and that the proteins and enzymatic activity required to synthesize this product are present in lungs. our observations suggest that cp450 enzyme products could be endogenous modulators of pulmonary vascular tone.
how possibly do leisure and social activities impact mental health of middle-aged adults in japan?: an evidence from a national longitudinal survey two new screening scales for psychological distress, the k6 and k10, have been developed using the item response theory and shown to outperform existing screeners in english. we developed their japanese versions using the standard backtranslaton method and included them in the world mental health survey japan (wmh‐j), which is a psychiatric epidemiologic study conducted in seven communities across japan with 2436 participants. the wmh‐j used the wmh survey initiative version of the composite international diagnostic interview (cidi) to assess the 30‐day diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders – fourth edition (dsm‐iv). performance of the two screening scales in detecting dsm‐iv mood and anxiety disorders, as assessed by the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (aucs), was excellent, with values as high as 0.94 (95% confidence interval = 0.88 to 0.99) for k6 and 0.94 (0.88 to 0.995) for k10. stratum‐specific likelihood ratios (sslrs), which express screening test characteristics and can be used to produce individual‐level predicted probabilities of being a case from screening scale scores and pretest probabilities in other samples, were strikingly similar between the japanese and the original versions. the japanese versions of the k6 and k10 thus demonstrated screening performances essentially equivalent to those of the original english versions. copyright © 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.
serotonin transporter mrna levels are associated with the methylation of an upstream cpg island we determined the genomic organization of the human opa-containing gene (hopa) and characterized its developmental expression. the gene encoding hopa, which contains a rare polymorphism tightly associated with non-specific mental retardation, is 25 kb in length and consists of 44 exons. a promoter scan analysis demonstrates two possible transcription initiation sites without tata boxes upstream from the putative translation initiation start site. several informative polymorphisms are evident in the sequence including a large pentanucleotide repeat. northern blot analysis of the gene transcript and its murine orthologue, mopa-1, demonstrates that only one transcript is expressed throughout the soma and the cns, and that the transcript is highly expressed during early fetal development. we conclude that the delineation of the function of the hopa gene locus merits further study.
the role of prefrontal cortex d1-like and d2-like receptors in cocaine-seeking behavior in rats rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (1.5 mg/kg i.v.) under either a fixed ratio (fr) or progressive ratio (pr) schedule of reinforcement. following acquisition, bilateral intracerebral cannulae were directed at the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) or striatum (strm). intracranial injections of the d1 receptor antagonist, sch 23390 (0-2.0 micrograms/0.5 microliter/side), were made immediately prior to a self-administration session. under the fr 1 schedule, sch 23390 caused a dose-dependent increase in the rate of cocaine intake following injection into either the mpfc or the strm. in contrast, under the pr schedule similar injections into the strm had no effect on the breaking point, but large decreases were produced following injection into the mpfc. these results indicate that dopaminergic systems within the mpfc have a significant role to play in the reinforcing properties of cocaine. moreover, the strm does not appear to have a role in those reinforcing properties of cocaine measured under the pr schedule. the significant rate-increasing effects obtained from the strm under the fr schedule, indicate that the two schedules must measure different aspects of cocaine's cns action.
age-related predictors of institutionalization: results of the german study on ageing, cognition and dementia in primary care patients (agecode) the use of formal devices for assessing function is becoming standard in agencies serving the elderly. in the gerontological society's recent contract study on functional assessment (howell, 1968), a large assortment of rating scales, checklists, and other techniques in use in applied settings was easily assembled. the present state of the trade seems to be one in which each investigator or practitioner feels an inner compusion to make his own scale and to cry that other existent scales cannot possibly fit his own setting. the authors join this company in presenting two scales first standardized on their own population (lawton, 1969). they take some comfort, however, in the fact that one scale, the physical self-maintenance scale (psms), is largely a scale developed and used by other investigators (lowenthal, 1964), which was adapted for use in our own institution. the second of the scales, the instrumental activities of daily living scale (iadl), taps a level of functioning heretofore inadequately represented in attempts to assess everyday functional competence. both of the scales have been tested further for their usefulness in a variety of types of institutions and other facilities serving community-resident older people. before describing in detail the behavior measured by these two scales, we shall briefly describe the schema of competence into which these behaviors fit (lawton, 1969). human behavior is viewed as varying in the degree of complexity required for functioning in a variety of tasks. the lowest level is called life maintenance, followed by the successively more complex levels of func-
classifying urban land use by integrating remote sensing and social media data with the rapid expansion of new available information presented to us online on a daily basis, text classification becomes imperative in order to classify and maintain it. word2vec offers a unique perspective to the text mining community. by converting words and phrases into a vector representation, word2vec takes an entirely new approach on text classification. based on the assumption that word2vec brings extra semantic features that helps in text classification, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of word2vec by showing that tf-idf and word2vec combined can outperform tf-idf because word2vec provides complementary features (e.g. semantics that tf-idf can't capture) to tf-idf. our results show that the combination of word2vec weighted by tf-idf and tf-idf does not outperform tf-idf consistently. it is consistent enough to say the combination of the two can outperform either individually.
enhanced green fluorescent protein expression may be used to monitor murine coronavirus spread in vitro and in the mouse central nervous system abstract coronaviruses generally have a narrow host range, infecting one or just a few species. using targeted rna recombination, we constructed a mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) in which the ectodomain of the spike glycoprotein (s) was replaced with the highly divergent ectodomain of the s protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus. the resulting chimeric virus, designated fmhv, acquired the ability to infect feline cells and simultaneously lost the ability to infect murine cells in tissue culture. this reciprocal switch of species specificity strongly supports the notion that coronavirus host cell range is determined primarily at the level of interactions between the s protein and the virus receptor. the isolation of fmhv allowed the localization of the region responsible for s protein incorporation into virions to the carboxy-terminal 64 of the 1,324 residues of this protein. this establishes a basis for further definition of elements involved in virion assembly. in addition, fmhv is potentially the ideal recipient virus for carrying out reverse genetics of mhv by targeted rna recombination, since it presents the possibility of selecting recombinants, no matter how defective, that have regained the ability to replicate in murine cells.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
the lysr-type pcaq protein regulates expression of a protocatechuate-inducible abc-type transport system in sinorhizobium meliloti. using physical and genetic data, we have demonstrated that rhizobium meliloti su47 has a symbiotic megaplasmid, prmesu47b, in addition to the previously described nod-nif megaplasmid prmesu47a. this plasmid includes four loci involved in exopolysaccharide (exo) synthesis as well as two loci involved in thiamine biosynthesis. mutations at the exo loci have previously been shown to result in the formation of nodules which lack infection threads (inf-) and fail to fix nitrogen (fix-). thus, both megaplasmids contain genes involved in the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. mutations at two other exo loci were not located on either megaplasmid. to mobilize the megaplasmids, the orit of plasmid rk2 was inserted into them. on alfalfa, agrobacterium tumefaciens strains containing prmesu47a induced marked root hair curling with no infection threads and fix- nodules, as reported by others. this plant phenotype was not observed to change with a. tumefaciens strains containing both prmesu47a and prmesu47b megaplasmids, and strains containing prmesu47b alone failed to curl root hairs or form nodules.
a phase i dose-escalation study of the vegfr inhibitor tivozanib hydrochloride with weekly paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer purpose: to assess the maximum tolerated dose (mtd)/dose-limiting toxicities (dlt), safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of tivozanib, a potent and selective oral vegf receptor (vegfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. experimental design: dose levels of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/d tivozanib for 28 days followed by 14 days of medication were explored in patients with advanced solid tumors. results: forty-one patients were enrolled. animal data incorrectly predicted toxicity, resulting in dlts at the starting dose (2.0 mg) consisting of grade 3 proteinuria and hypertension and grade 3 ataxia. at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. at an intermediate dose (1.5 mg), 1 patient experienced dlt consisting of grade 3 hypertension. this dose was determined as the mtd. of 10 additional patients treated at 1.5 mg, 1 patient each experienced grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 fatigue, and 2 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevation. in 12 additional patients treated at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. pharmacokinetics displayed long absorption time, dose proportional exposure, and a half-life of 4.7 days. plasma levels of vegf-a and soluble vegfr-2 showed dose-dependent increases and decreases, respectively. dynamic contrast-enhanced mri indicated reduction in tumor perfusion. clinical activity was observed in renal cell cancer, colorectal cancer, and other tumors. conclusion: tivozanib was well tolerated with manageable side effects. the pharmacokinetics profile revealed that tivozanib was suitable for once-daily dosing. encouraging and durable clinical activity was observed. the recommended daily dose of tivozanib in a 4-week-on and 2-week-off dosing regimen is 1.5 mg. clin cancer res; 17(22); 7156–63. ©2011 aacr.
participation of mitochondrial respiratory complex iii in neutrophil activation and lung injury. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) is activated by increases in the intracellular amp-to-atp ratio and plays a central role in cellular responses to metabolic stress. although activation of ampk has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, there is little information concerning the role that ampk may play in modulating neutrophil function and neutrophil-dependent inflammatory events, such as acute lung injury. to examine these issues, we determined the effects of pharmacological activators of ampk, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (aicar) and barberine, on toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-induced neutrophil activation. aicar and barberine dose-dependently activated ampk in murine bone marrow neutrophils. exposure of lps-stimulated neutrophils to aicar or barberine inhibited release of tnf-alpha and il-6, as well as degradation of ikappabalpha and nuclear translocation of nf-kappab, compared with findings in neutrophil cultures that contained lps without aicar or barberine. administration of aicar to mice resulted in activation of ampk in the lungs and was associated with decreased severity of lps-induced lung injury, as determined by diminished neutrophil accumulation in the lungs, reduced interstitial pulmonary edema, and diminished levels of tnf-alpha and il-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. these results suggest that ampk activation reduces tlr4-induced neutrophil activation and diminishes the severity of neutrophil-driven proinflammatory processes, including acute lung injury.
adaptation of the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex to head movements in rotating frames of reference the time constant of the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (avor), measured from the response to steps of rotation about a yaw axis, has frequently been estimated as a single exponential. however, the slow phase velocity envelope during per- or post-rotatory nystagmus is more accurately represented by two exponential modes. one represents activity in the vestibular nerve induced by deflection of the cupula, the other by activation that the input from the canals produces in the central velocity storage integrator. the sum of the cupula and the integrator responses describes the overall response of slow phase eye velocity and can be approximated by a double exponential. frequently, there is a plateau in the initial portion of eye velocity response, but this may be masked by habituation, making the cupula contribution unobservable and impossible to estimate. using a model-based technique to analyze responses with a clear plateau, we estimated peripheral and central vestibular time constants by double exponential fits to slow phase eye velocity. cupular time constants were varied from 1 to 10 s to identify values that gave optimal fits of the data according to a chi-square criterion. the mean cupular time constant for 10 human subjects was 4.2 +/- 0.6 s. fits of the data were also good for time constants between 3.5 to 7 s, but not for 1 to 3 or 7.5 to 10 s. the estimated cupular time constants also fit responses where there was no plateau. in 8 monkeys, cupular time constants were estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.5 s, which agreed with those derived from activity in the vestibular nerve. there was no difference between monkey and human cupular time constants from these estimates. it is likely that the human cupular time constant is similar to that of the monkey and shorter than previously thought.
privacy-preserving genome-wide association studies on cloud environment using fully homomorphic encryption fully homomorphic encryption is faced with two problems now. one is candidate fully homomorphic encryption schemes are few. another is that the efficiency of fully homomorphic encryption is a big question. in this paper, we propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on lwe, which has better key size. our main contributions are: (1) according to the binary-lwe recently, we choose secret key from binary set and modify the basic encryption scheme proposed in linder and peikert in 2010. we propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on the new basic encryption scheme. we analyze the correctness and give the proof of the security of our scheme. the public key, evaluation keys and tensored ciphertext have better size in our scheme. (2) estimating parameters for fully homomorphic encryption scheme is an important work. we estimate the concert parameters for our scheme. we compare these parameters between our scheme and bra12 scheme. our scheme have public key and private key that smaller by a factor of about logq than in bra12 scheme. tensored ciphertext in our scheme is smaller by a factor of about log2q than in bra12 scheme. key switching matrix in our scheme is smaller by a factor of about log3q than in bra12 scheme.
mir-195 regulates sirt1-mediated changes in diabetic retinopathy in diabetes, some of the cellular changes are similar to aging. we hypothesized that hyperglycemia accelerates aging-like changes in the endothelial cells (ecs) and tissues leading to structural and functional damage. we investigated glucose-induced aging in 3 types of ecs using senescence associated β-gal (sa β-gal) staining and cell morphology. alterations of sirtuins (sirts) and their downstream mediator foxo and oxidative stress were investigated. relationship of such alteration with histone acetylase (hat) p300 was examined. similar examinations were performed in tissues of diabetic animals. ecs in high glucose (hg) showed evidence of early senescence as demonstrated by increased sa β-gal positivity and reduced replicative capacities. these alterations were pronounced in microvascular ecs. they developed an irregular and hypertrophic phenotype. such changes were associated with decreased sirt (1–7) mrna expressions. we also found that p300 and sirt1 regulate each other in such process, as silencing one led to increase of the others’ expression. furthermore, hg caused reduction in foxo1’s dna binding ability and antioxidant target gene expressions. chemically induced increased sirt1 activity and p300 knockdown corrected these abnormalities slowing aging-like changes. diabetic animals showed increased cellular senescence in renal glomerulus and retinal blood vessels along with reduced sirt1 mrna expressions in these tissues. data from this study demonstrated that hyperglycemia accelerates aging-like process in the vascular ecs and such process is mediated via downregulation of sirt1, causing reduction of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme in a p300 and foxo1 mediated pathway.
the effect of document types and sizes on the scaling relationship between citations and co-authorship patterns in management journals the aim of this paper is to extend our knowledge about the power-law relationship between citation-based performance and collaboration patterns for papers by analyzing its behavior at the level of a national science system. we analyzed 3012 cuban articles on natural sciences that received 17,295 citations. the number of articles published through collaboration accounted for 94 %. the collaborative articles accounted for 96 % of overall citations. the citation-based performance and international collaboration patterns exhibit a power-law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.22 ± 0.08. citations to a field’s research internationally collaborative articles in natural sciences tended to increase 2.1.22 or 2.33 times each time it doubles the number of internationally collaborative papers. the matthew effect is stronger for internationally collaborative papers than for domestic collaborative articles.
anticancer potential of the histone deacetylase inhibitor-like effects of flavones, a subclass of polyphenolic compounds: a review in an attempt to identify phytochemicals contributing to the well-documented preventive effect of plant-based diets on cancer incidence and mortality, we have previously shown that certain flavonoids inhibit in vitro angiogenesis. here, we show that the flavonoid luteolin inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in a murine xenograft model. furthermore, luteolin inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf)-induced in vivo angiogenesis in the rabbit corneal assay. in agreement, luteolin inhibited both vegf-induced survival and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) with an ic50 of about 5 μmol/l. luteolin inhibited vegf-induced phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (pi3k) activity in huvecs, and this inhibition was critical for both the antisurvival and antimitotic affects of the compound. indeed, luteolin abolished vegf-induced activation of akt, a downstream target of pi3k conveying both survival and mitotic downstream signals. because overexpression of a constitutively active form of akt rescued huvecs only from the antisurvival effects of luteolin, the result indicated that luteolin targeted mainly the survival signals of the pi3k/akt pathway. with regard to its antimitotic activity, luteolin inhibited vegf-induced phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase (s6k), a downstream effector of pi3k responsible for g1 progression. indeed, vegf-induced proliferation of huvecs was sensitive to rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 s6k activation. surprisingly, luteolin did not affect vegf-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases, a pathway that is considered important for the mitotic effects of vegf. thus, blockade of pi3k by luteolin was responsible for the inhibitory effects of the compound on vegf-induced survival and proliferation of huvecs. the antisurvival effects of luteolin were mediated via blockage of pi3k/akt-dependent pathways, whereas inhibition of the pi3k/p70 s6k pathway mediated the antimitotic effects of the compound.
protein kinetics determined in vivo with a multiple-tracer, single-sample protocol: application to lactase synthesis. conscious unrestrained piglets were fasted overnight and infused intravenously with [2h3]leucine for 6 h. sucrase isomaltase and lactase phlorizin hydrolase were immunoprecipitated from jejunal mucosal membranes, and the immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels. bands corresponding to the pro and mature isoforms of both enzymes were acid hydrolyzed. [2h3]leucine isotopic enrichment was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using negative chemical ionization. plasma leucine reached isotopic steady state within 90 min. the isotopic enrichment of mucosal leucine was 73% of that of plasma leucine. the high mannose and complex glycosylated forms of prolactase were in isotopic equilibrium, and their isotopic enrichment was 94% of mucosal leucine. the fractional synthesis rates of total and membrane protein were 0.45 and 0.65 days-1, whereas the processing rates of mature lactase, sucrase, and isomaltase were 0.90, 0.23, and 0.21 days-1, respectively. approximately 65% of the label in the sucrase isomaltase immunoprecipitate was in the complex glycosylated precursor, whereas 73% of the label in lactase phlorizin hydrolase was in the mature (160 kda) form. we conclude that the low rate of brush-border sucrase synthesis reflects a slow rate at which the complex glycosylated precursor is processed to the brush-border form.
curcumin augments lung maturation, preventing neonatal lung injury by inhibiting tgf-β signaling. the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar) γ plays a central role in normal lung development. however, the effects of modulating pparγ expression by exogenously administered pparγ agonists on lung development and basic blood biochemical and metabolic profiles in a developing animal are not known. to determine these effects, newborn sprague-dawley rat pups were administered either diluent or rosiglitazone (rgz), a potent pparγ agonist, for either 1 or 7 d. then the pups were killed and the lungs were examined for specific markers of alveolar epithelial, mesenchymal, and vascular maturation, and lung morphometry. the effect of rgz on a limited number of blood biochemical and metabolic parameters was also determined. overall, systemically administered rgz significantly enhanced lung maturation without affecting serum electrolytes, blood glucose, blood gases, plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum cardiac troponin levels. the lung maturation effect of pparγ agonists was also confirmed by another pparγ agonist, the naturally occurring pparγ ligand prostaglandin j2. we conclude that systemically administered rgz significantly enhances lung maturation without significantly affecting the acute blood biochemical and metabolic profiles, providing rationale for further studying pparγ agonists for enhancing lung maturation, and for promoting lung injury/repair in neonates.

quadratic regularization with cubic descent for unconstrained optimization ∗ in this work we propose a class of quasi-newton methods to minimize a twice differentiable function with lipschitz continuous hessian. these methods are based on the quadratic regularization of newton’s method, with algebraic explicit rules for computing the regularizing parameter. the convergence properties of this class of methods are analysed. we show that if the sequence generated by the algorithm converges then its limit point is stationary. we also establish local quadratic convergence in a neighborhood of a stationary point with positive definite hessian. encouraging numerical experiments are presented.

differential effects of oxytocin on agency and communion for anxiously and avoidantly attached individuals two studies investigated how contextually activating attachment relationships influences the working self-concept in terms of agency and communion. in study 1, 245 participants were primed with a secure, avoidant, or anxious-ambivalent relationship and the implicit accessibility of agency and communion was assessed using word fragments. activating a secure relationship increased the accessibility of communion, whereas activating an anxious-ambivalent relationship increased the accessibility of agency. in study 2, 123 participants were primed with a secure, preoccupied, avoidant-dismissive, or avoidant-fearful relationship and explicit self-perceptions of agency and communion traits were assessed using the extended personality attributes questionnaire (epaq). gender interacted with the attachment prime, such that men primed with a secure relationship reported higher communion than did men primed with an avoidant (dis-missive or fearful) relationship, whereas women primed with an anxious (preoccupied or fearful) relationship reported higher agency than did women primed with a secure relationship.
incorporating relevance and psuedo-relevance feedback in the markov random field model: brown at the trec'08 relevance feedback track this paper develops a general, formal framework for modeling term dependencies via markov random fields. the model allows for arbitrary text features to be incorporated as evidence. in particular, we make use of features based on occurrences of single terms, ordered phrases, and unordered phrases. we explore full independence, sequential dependence, and full dependence variants of the model. a novel approach is developed to train the model that directly maximizes the mean average precision rather than maximizing the likelihood of the training data. ad hoc retrieval experiments are presented on several newswire and web collections, including the gov2 collection used at the trec 2004 terabyte track. the results show significant improvements are possible by modeling dependencies, especially on the larger web collections.
identification of micrornas from amur grape (vitis amurensis rupr.) by deep sequencing and analysis of microrna variations with bioinformatics thirty-one potential mirnas that belong to 16 mirna families were discovered from more than 324 000 est sequences of apple (malus domestica). in addition, precise sequences, especially terminal nucleotides of the 16 apple mirnas (mdo-mirnas) in 16 families were validated by mir-race, a newly developed method for the determination of the potential mirnas predicted computationally. the expression of these 16 micrornas could be detected in apple young leaf, old leaf, young stem, flower bud, flower and developing fruits by quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) and some of them showed tissue-specific expression. fifty-six potential targets were identified for the 16 apple mirnas, most of which were transcription factors that play important roles in apple development. twelve target genes were experimentally verified by qrt-pcr, with some exhibiting different expression trends from their corresponding micrornas, indicating the cleavage mode of mirnas on their target genes.
the combined use of mechanical thrombectomy devices is feasible for treating acute carotid terminus occlusion background and purpose clinicians are insecure reading ct scans by using the one-third rule for acute middle cerebral artery stroke (1/3 mca rule) before treating patients with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. the 1/3 mca rule is a poorly defined volumetric estimate of the size of cerebral infarction of the mca. a 10-point quantitative topographic ct scan score, the alberta stroke program early ct score (aspects), is described and illustrated. a sharp increase in dependence and death occurs with an aspects of 7 or less. we describe how to use aspects and why it works with ct scans obtained on all commonly used axial baselines. we also describe interobserver reliability among clinicians from different specialties and with different experience in reading ct scans in the context of acute stroke.   methods the six physicians who developed aspects answered a questionnaire on precisely how they interpret and use aspects. the aspects areas as interpreted by these physicians were compared with one another and with standards in the literature. kappa statistics were used to assess the interobserver reliability of aspects versus the 1/3 mca rule.   results the exact methods of interpretation varied among the six individual observers, with either a 3:3 or 4:2 split on the specific questions. the overall interobserver agreement was good compared with that of the 1/3 mca rule. normal anatomic vascular and interobserver variations explain why aspects can be applied with different ct axial baselines.   conclusion aspects is a systematic, robust, and practical method that can be applied to different axial baselines. clinician agreement is superior to that of the 1/3 mca rule.
a cut-based heuristic to produce almost feasible periodic railway timetables during the last 15 years, many solution methods for the important task of constructing periodic timetables for public transportation companies have been proposed. we first point out the importance of an objective function, where we observe that in particular a linear objective function turns out to be a good compromise between essential practical requirements and computational tractability. then, we enter into a detailed empirical analysis of various mixed integer programming (mip) procedures — those using node variables and those using arc variables — genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and constraint programming. to our knowledge, this is the first comparison of five conceptually different solution approaches for periodic timetable optimization.
quantitative and functional interrogation of parent-of-origin allelic expression biases in the brain we present a novel pipeline and methodology for simultaneously estimating isoform expression and allelic imbalance in diploid organisms using rna-seq data. we achieve this by modeling the expression of haplotype-specific isoforms. if unknown, the two parental isoform sequences can be individually reconstructed. a new statistical method, mmseq, deconvolves the mapping of reads to multiple transcripts (isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms). our software can take into account non-uniform read generation and works with paired-end reads.
cognitive impairment after severe traumatic brain injury, clinical course and impact on outcome: a swedish-icelandic study the reaction level scale (rls85) is a "coma scale" for the direct assessment of overall reaction level in patients with acute brain disorders. it is devised for reliable use even in the management of patients who are difficult to assess, such as intubated patients and patients with swollen eyelids. we here present the manual of the rls85 and the guidelines for its use. the underlying concepts as well as limitations are outlined. condensed information of known reliability and validity is presented. a training scheme for presumed observers (doctors, nurses and assistant nurses) is outlined. it is suggested that users of the rls85 refer to these guidelines and in scientific reports clearly state any deviations from this present manual in order to facilitate valid comparisons between different studies and different groups of patients.
filtering genetic variants and placing informative priors based on putative biological function the new generation of whole genome sequencing platforms offers great possibilities and challenges for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits. with a very high number of sequence variants, a naïve multiple hypothesis threshold correction hinders the identification of reliable associations by the overreduction of statistical power. in this report, we examine 2 alternative approaches to improve the statistical power of a whole genome association study to detect reliable genetic associations. the approaches were tested using the genetic analysis workshop 19 (gaw19) whole genome sequencing data. the first tested method estimates the real number of effective independent tests actually being performed in whole genome association project by the use of an extreme value distribution and a set of phenotype simulations. given the familiar nature of the gaw19 data and the finite number of pedigree founders in the sample, the number of correlations between genotypes is greater than in a set of unrelated samples. using our procedure, we estimate that the effective number represents only 15 % of the total number of independent tests performed. however, even using this corrected significance threshold, no genome-wide significant association could be detected for systolic and diastolic blood pressure traits.the second approach implements a biological relevance-driven hypothesis tested by exploiting prior computational predictions on the effect of nonsynonymous genetic variants detected in a whole genome sequencing association study. this guided testing approach was able to identify 2 promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), 1 for each trait, targeting biologically relevant genes that could help shed light on the genesis of the human hypertension. the first gene, pfh14, associated with systolic blood pressure, interacts directly with genes involved in calcium-channel formation and the second gene, map4, encodes a microtubule-associated protein and had already been detected by previous genome-wide association study experiments conducted in an asian population. our results highlight the necessity of the development of alternative approached to improve the efficiency on the detection of reasonable candidate associations in whole genome sequencing studies.
current spectrum of malabsorption syndrome in adults in india methods for the determination of the total amount of fat in feces and of the relative proportions of free and combined fatty acids are described. they are based on the principle that fatty acids and fat can be extracted almost quantitatively with petroleum ether from an acidic, alcoholic solution of about 60 per cent ethanol, saturated with nacl and containing a small amount of amyl alcohol. by these methods the fat in feces can be measured within 35 to 45 minutes with an error not exceeding 2 per cent.
reproducibility in echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function in a population based study (the stanislas cohort study) quantification of cardiac chamber size, ventricular mass and function ranks among the most clinically important and most frequently requested tasks of echocardiography. over the last decades, echocardiographic methods and techniques have improved and expanded dramatically, due to the introduction of higher frequency transducers, harmonic imaging, fully digital machines, left-sided contrast agents, and other technological advancements. furthermore, echocardiography due to its portability and versatility is now used in emergency rooms, operating rooms, and intensive care units. standardization of measurements in echocardiography has been inconsistent and less successful, compared to other imaging techniques and consequently, echocardiographic measurements are sometimes perceived as less reliable. therefore, the american society of echocardiography, working together with the european association of echocardiography, a branch of the european society of cardiology, has critically reviewed the literature and updated the recommendations for quantifying cardiac chambers using echocardiography. this document reviews the technical aspects on how to perform quantitative chamber measurements of morphology and function, which is a component of every complete echocardiographic examination.
wind fields in heterogeneous conifer canopies: parameterisation of momentum absorption using high-resolution 3d vegetation scans abstract a mathematical, computer-based, dynamic sway model of a sitka spruce (picea sitchensis) tree was developed and tested against measurements of the movement of a tree within a forest. the model tree was divided into segments each with a stiffness, mass and damping parameter. equations were formulated to describe the response of every segment which together form a system of coupled differential equations. these were solved with the aid of matrices and from the resulting modes, the transfer function of the tree was found and used to calculate the movement of the tree in the wind. comparison of the modelled movement of a tree in response to the measured wind speed above a forest canopy gave good agreement with the measured movement of the top of the tree but less satisfactory agreement close to the base. the comparison also pointed to the complexity of tree response to the wind and inadequacies in the model. in particular, the branches need to be treated as coupled cantilevers attached to the stem rather than simply as masses lumped together.
screening for inhalational anthrax due to bioterrorism: evaluating proposed screening protocols. context in the event of a bioterrorist attack, it may be difficult to distinguish inhalational anthrax from viral respiratory tract disease. contribution this synthesis compares reported symptoms of 28 patients with inhalational anthrax and 4694 patients with viral respiratory tract illnesses. fever and cough were common in both infections. mental confusion or loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, and nausea and vomiting more often indicated anthrax, whereas sore throat and runny nose more often indicated viral infection. implications several symptoms, including neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms and shortness of breath, may help distinguish inhalational anthrax from respiratory viral illness. the editors the 2001 anthrax attacks in the united states, in which 11 people developed the inhalational form of the disease and 5 died, exposed a weakness in the u.s. medical response to bioterrorism (1). despite heroic efforts on behalf of the victims, physicians were largely unprepared to recognize the early symptoms and signs of this extremely rare and rapidly progressive infection in ambulatory patients (2). initially, 4 of the 11 patients were sent home after being seen as outpatients or in an emergency department with diagnoses that included viral syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis (3, 4). physicians first considered a diagnosis of anthrax in 2 of these patients (both postal workers) on their second visits to the emergency department and then only after hearing media reports of illness among other postal employees (3). inhalation of anthrax spores leads to clinical disease from elaboration of two toxins, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase known as edema factor and a zinc metalloproteinase called lethal factor, by phagocytosed bacteria in the mediastinal lymph nodes and bloodstream (5). classic pathologic findings include hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis; primary anthrax pneumonia is rare (6, 7). without prompt treatment, death occurs rapidly from a combination of shock and respiratory compromise. anthrax has been classified by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention as one of six category a bioterrorist agents posing the greatest risk to civilian populations (8). a large-scale anthrax attack has the potential to cause casualties on a scale that would quickly overwhelm local and regional health care treatment capacity (6). the emergency response to such an attack would probably include the establishment of multiple mass prophylaxis centers physically distinct from hospital emergency departments (to prevent overcrowding and potential contamination) for rapid dispensing of prophylactic antibiotics to exposed populations and for identifying individuals suspected of having inhalational anthrax (9). presumptive cases would be transferred to established or temporary medical care facilities for rapid definitive testing and initiation of combination antimicrobial treatment, which may improve outcomes (10-12). efficient management of this limited medical care capacity is an important secondary goal of outpatient triage during a bioterrorism response (13, 14). screening and triage protocols used in these settings would need to rely on presenting symptoms and signs because laboratory or radiographic testing will probably not be feasible in high-volume mass prophylaxis centers (15). we sought to establish an evidence base for developing a screening protocol for inhalational anthrax. the utility of such a protocol, which improves both case detection and case exclusion, would also extend beyond the immediate mass prophylaxis setting because large numbers of individuals outside the exposure zone will probably seek reassurance from health care providers for symptomatic illnesses in the aftermath of a major attack. providing scientific evidence on which to base these discussions may decrease postattack anxiety and inappropriate utilization of health care resources (16). methods clinical data on the 11 inhalational anthrax cases of 2001 are now widely available (3, 4, 17-20). because of the small number of cases in the contemporary attack, we performed a systematic literature review to identify additional original case reports of inhalational anthrax in the english-language medical literature. we searched two computerized databases (medline and web of science) for adult human case reports of anthrax infection between 1960 and 2000 using the keywords anthrax and case report. this yielded 44 references; 4 contained sufficient clinical data on inhalational anthrax to permit comparison with the 11 contemporary cases (21-24). tracing bibliographies of these articles and a recent review article (25) produced an additional 7 articles that were appropriate for inclusion, for a total of 11 reports on 17 cases (26-32). two of the cases involved patients from outside of the united states (22, 24). we interpreted lack of mention of a specific symptom or abnormal sign in these reports as indicating the absence of that finding from the patient's clinical presentation. we compared proportions of symptoms and signs in historical and contemporary cases using the fisher exact test; clinical features that had consistent prevalence rates in earlier and contemporary cases were candidates for comparison with viral respiratory tract disease. viral respiratory tract infections, such as with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses or coronaviruses, are appropriate comparison conditions for this study because of their prevalence and potential similarity to inhalational anthrax (15, 33). we searched medline for descriptive epidemiologic reports of presenting clinical features of laboratory-confirmed influenza and noninfluenza viral respiratory illnesses in ambulatory adults; we found five published studies that met the search criteria (34-38). we did not include studies that describe samples of mixed influenza and noninfluenza cases (39-42) or that present data already reported in these five studies (43). we did not compare anthrax cases with asymptomatic persons (because they would not present a screening dilemma) or with acutely ill patients (because they would probably not participate in mass screening). since there are no reports of inhalational anthrax in pediatric patients, we limited our comparison sample to adult patients. finally, we also compared anthrax cases to ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia to highlight the difficulty of distinguishing these two conditions (44). we calculated positive likelihood ratios with 95% cis for the presence of selected signs and symptoms in inhalational anthrax versus influenza, influenza-like illness, and ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia. the positive likelihood ratio is defined here as the prevalence of a symptom or sign among inhalational anthrax cases divided by the prevalence of the same symptom or sign in the influenza, influenza-like illness, or pneumonia comparison groups. the positive likelihood ratio is the multiplicative factor that increases or decreases the odds of having inhalational anthrax as opposed to one of these comparison diseases, given the presence of a clinical finding (45). therefore, the post-test probability of having inhalational anthrax is influenced by both the magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio and the pretest probability of having the disease (46). in the appropriate clinical setting (that is, when the pretest probability of having the target disease is not zero), likelihood ratios greater than 3 or less than 0.3 are considered clinically important (47). the general approach used heredeveloping diagnostic algorithms for rare diagnoses by using likelihood ratios and by establishing hypothetical comparison groups populated by common medical conditionshas been previously described (46, 48, 49). the study sponsors had no role in the design, conduct, and reporting of the data or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. results presenting symptoms and signs and radiographic results for the 11 deliberately infected contemporary cases and 17 occupationally or environmentally infected historical cases were similar, although contemporary patients reported significantly more fever/chills and fatigue or malaise (table 1). all but 1 of the 28 patients (including 100% of the contemporary patients) had fever, chills, or cough on presentation. (the single exception was a patient who presented with impending shock, which limited the ability to record a complete history.) other symptoms that affected more than half of all patients included dyspnea (68%), chest discomfort or pain (61%), and nausea or vomiting (61%). more than half of current case-patients and 43% of the combined sample presented with neurologic symptoms other than headache, including confusion, blurred vision, and dizziness. only a few patients with inhalational anthrax reported sore throat (18%) or rhinorrhea (14%). table 1. summary of symptoms and signs at initial presentation: historical versus contemporary patients with inhalational anthrax eighty-one percent of patients presented with abnormalities on lung auscultation, including rales or rhonchi (65%) and dullness or decreased breath sounds (58%). respiratory symptoms often did not match findings on lung physical examination. four of the five patients with no respiratory symptoms had positive findings (rales), whereas 8 of the 23 patients with respiratory symptoms had no abnormality on lung examination. outcomes differed significantly between historical and contemporary patients: 16 of the 17 historical patients died compared with only 5 of the 11 contemporary patients. the presenting clinical features of the 28 patients can be divided into nine symptom complexes involving respiratory; gastrointestinal; ear, nose, and throat; and nonheadache neurologic problems (figure 1). the single most common presentation was a combination of respirato
hairpins participating in folding of human telomeric sequence quadruplexes studied by standard and t-remd simulations explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been used to complement preceding experimental and computational studies of folding of guanine quadruplexes (g-dna). we initiate early stages of unfolding of several g-dnas by simulating them under no-salt conditions and then try to fold them back using standard excess salt simulations. there is a significant difference between g-dnas with all-anti parallel stranded stems and those with stems containing mixtures of syn and anti guanosines. the most natural rearrangement for all-anti stems is a vertical mutual slippage of the strands. this leads to stems with reduced numbers of tetrads during unfolding and a reduction of strand slippage during refolding. the presence of syn nucleotides prevents mutual strand slippage; therefore, the antiparallel and hybrid quadruplexes initiate unfolding via separation of the individual strands. the simulations confirm the capability of g-dna molecules to adopt numerous stable locally and globally misfolded structures. the key point for a proper individual folding attempt appears to be correct prior distribution of syn and anti nucleotides in all four g-strands. the results suggest that at the level of individual molecules, g-dna folding is an extremely multi-pathway process that is slowed by numerous misfolding arrangements stabilized on highly variable timescales.
effects of β-adrenergic blockade on hepatic and renal glucose production during hypoglycemia in conscious dogs. the contribution of gluconeogenic precursors to renal glucose production (rgp) during insulin-induced hypoglycemia was assessed in conscious dogs. ten days after surgical placement of sampling catheters in the right and left renal veins and femoral artery and an infusion catheter in the left renal artery, systemic and renal glucose and glycerol kinetics were measured with peripheral infusions of [6-3h]glucose and [2-13c]glycerol. renal blood flow was determined with a flowprobe, and the renal balance of lactate, alanine, and glycerol was calculated by arteriovenous difference. after baseline, six dogs received 2-h simultaneous infusions of peripheral insulin (4 mu x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and left intrarenal [6,6-2h]dextrose (14 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) to achieve and maintain left renal normoglycemia during systemic hypoglycemia. arterial glucose decreased from 5.3 +/- 0.1 to 2.2 +/- 0.1 mmol/l; insulin increased from 46 +/- 5 to 1,050 +/- 50 pmol/l; epinephrine, from 130 +/- 8 to 1,825 +/- 50 pg/ml; norepinephrine, from 129 +/- 6 to 387 +/- 15 pg/ml; and glucagon, from 52 +/- 2 to 156 +/- 12 pg/ml (all p < 0.01). rgp increased from 1.7 +/- 0.4 to 3.0 +/- 0.5 (left) and from 0.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 (right) micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) (p < 0.01). whole-body glycerol appearance increased from 6.0 +/- 0.5 to 7.7 +/- 0.7 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)(p < 0.01); renal conversion of glycerol to glucose increased from 0.13 +/- 0.04 to 0.30 +/- 0.10 (left) and from 0.11 +/- 0.03 to 0.25 +/- 0.05 (right) micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), (p < 0.05). net renal gluconeogenic precursor uptake increased from 1.5 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.4 (left) and from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 3.8 +/- 0.4 (right) micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) (p < 0.01). renal lactate uptake could account for approximately 40% of postabsorptive rgp and for 60% of rgp during hypoglycemia. these results indicate that gluconeogenic precursor extraction by the kidney, particularly lactate, is stimulated by counterregulatory hormones and accounts for a significant fraction of the enhanced gluconeogenesis induced by hypoglycemia.
a prospective assessment of clinical and patient-reported outcomes of initial non-operative management of ventral hernias objective: to achieve consensus on the best practices in the management of ventral hernias (vh). background: management patterns for vh are heterogeneous, often with little supporting evidence or correlation with existing evidence. methods: a systematic review identified the highest level of evidence available for each topic. a panel of expert hernia-surgeons was assembled. email questionnaires, evidence review, panel discussion, and iterative voting was performed. consensus was when all experts agreed on a management strategy. results: experts agreed that complications with vh repair (vhr) increase in obese patients (grade a), current smokers (grade a), and patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) ≥ 6.5% (grade b). elective vhr was not recommended for patients with bmi ≥ 50 kg/m2 (grade c), current smokers (grade a), or patients with hba1c ≥ 8.0% (grade b). patients with bmi= 30–50 kg/m2 or hba1c = 6.5–8.0% require individualized interventions to reduce surgical risk (grade c, grade b). nonoperative management was considered to have a low-risk of short-term morbidity (grade c). mesh reinforcement was recommended for repair of hernias ≥ 2 cm (grade a). there were several areas where high-quality data were limited, and no consensus could be reached, including mesh type, component separation technique, and management of complex patients. conclusions: although there was consensus, supported by grade a–c evidence, on patient selection, the safety of short-term nonoperative management, and mesh reinforcement, among experts; there was limited evidence and broad variability in practice patterns in all other areas of practice. the lack of strong evidence and expert consensus on these topics has identified gaps in knowledge where there is need of further evidence.
nidovirus transcription: how to make sense...? at the vith international symposium on corona and related viruses held in québec, canada in 1994 we presented a new model for coronavirus transcription to explain how subgenome-length minus strands, which are used as templates for the synthesis of subgenomic mrnas, might arise by a process involving discontinuous rna synthesis. the old model explaining subgenomic mrna synthesis, which was called leader-primed transcription, was based on erroneous evidence that only genome-length negative strands were present in replicative intermediates. to explain the discovery of subgenome-length minus strands, a related model, called the replicon model, was proposed: the subgenomic mrnas would be produced initially by leader-primed transcription and then replicated into minus-strand templates that would in turn be transcribed into subgenomic mrnas. we review the experimental evidence that led us to formulate a third model proposing that the discontinuous event in coronavirus rna synthesis occurs during minus strand synthesis. with our model the genome is copied both continuously to produce minus-strand templates for genome rna synthesis and discontinuously to produce minus-strand templates for subgenomic mrna synthesis, and the subgenomic mrnas do not function as templates for minus strand synthesis, only the genome does.
consumption of dairy products and colorectal cancer in the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (epic) objective:this paper describes the ad hoc methodological concepts and procedures developed to improve the comparability of nutrient databases (ndbs) across the 10 european countries participating in the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (epic). this was required because there is currently no european reference ndb available.design:a large network involving national compilers, nutritionists and experts on food chemistry and computer science was set up for the ‘epic nutrient database’ (endb) project. a total of 550–1500 foods derived from about 37 000 standardized epic 24-h dietary recalls (24-hdrs) were matched as closely as possible to foods available in the 10 national ndbs. the resulting national data sets (nds) were then successively documented, standardized and evaluated according to common guidelines and using a database management system specifically designed for this project. the nutrient values of foods unavailable or not readily available in ndss were approximated by recipe calculation, weighted averaging or adjustment for weight changes and vitamin/mineral losses, using common algorithms.results:the final endb contains about 550–1500 foods depending on the country and 26 common components. each component value was documented and standardized for unit, mode of expression, definition and chemical method of analysis, as far as possible. furthermore, the overall completeness of ndss was improved (⩾99%), particularly for β-carotene and vitamin e.conclusion:the endb constitutes a first real attempt to improve the comparability of ndbs across european countries. this methodological work will provide a useful tool for nutritional research as well as end-user recommendations to improve ndbs in the future.
towards refactoring-aware regression test selection the paper describes a system called testtube that combines static and dynamic analysis to perform selective retesting of software systems written in c. testtube first identifies which functions, types, variables and macros are covered by each test unit in a test suite. each time the system under test is modified, testtube identifies which entities were changed to create the new version. using the coverage and change information, testtube selects only those test units that cover the changed entities for testing the new version. we have applied testtube to selective retesting of two software systems, an i/o library and a source code analyzer. additionally, we are adapting testtube for selective retesting of nondeterministic systems, where the main drawback is the unsuitability of dynamic analysis for identification of covered entities. our experience with testtube has been quite encouraging, with an observed reduction of 50% or more in the number of test cases needed to test typical software changes.<<etx>>
syntactic processing using the generalized perceptron and beam search learning general functional dependencies is one of the main goals in machine learning. recent progress in kernel-based methods has focused on designing flexible and powerful input representations. this paper addresses the complementary issue of problems involving complex outputs such as multiple dependent output variables and structured output spaces. we propose to generalize multiclass support vector machine learning in a formulation that involves features extracted jointly from inputs and outputs. the resulting optimization problem is solved efficiently by a cutting plane algorithm that exploits the sparseness and structural decomposition of the problem. we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method on problems ranging from supervised grammar learning and named-entity recognition, to taxonomic text classification and sequence alignment.
interleukin-17 causes rho-kinase-mediated endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. chronic treatment with the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin leads to hypertension; however, the mechanisms are unknown. rapamycin binds fk506 binding protein 12 and its related isoform 12.6 (fkbp12/12.6) and displaces them from intracellular ca release channels (ryanodine receptors) eliciting a ca leak from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum. we tested whether this ca leak promotes conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase phosphorylation at thr495, which reduces production of the vasodilator no. rapamycin treatment of control mice for 7 days, as well as genetic deletion of fkbp12.6, increased systolic arterial pressure significantly compared with controls. untreated aortas from fkbp12.6 / mice and in vitro rapamycin-treated control aortas had similarly decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation responses and no production and increased endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and protein kinase c activity. inhibition of either conventional protein kinase c or ryanodine receptor restored endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and endothelial function to control levels. rapamycin induced a small increase in basal intracellular ca levels in isolated endothelial cells, and rapamycin or fkbp12.6 gene deletion decreased acetylcholine-induced intracellular ca release, all of which were reversed by ryanodine. these data demonstrate that displacement of fkbp12/12.6 from ryanodine receptors induces an endothelial intracellular ca leak and increases conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation leading to decreased no production and endothelial dysfunction. this molecular mechanism may, in part, explain rapamycin-induced hypertension. (hypertension. 2007;49:569-576.)
robust and accurate object tracking under various types of occlusions we present an approach that incorporates appearance-adaptive models in a particle filter to realize robust visual tracking and recognition algorithms. tracking needs modeling interframe motion and appearance changes, whereas recognition needs modeling appearance changes between frames and gallery images. in conventional tracking algorithms, the appearance model is either fixed or rapidly changing, and the motion model is simply a random walk with fixed noise variance. also, the number of particles is typically fixed. all these factors make the visual tracker unstable. to stabilize the tracker, we propose the following modifications: an observation model arising from an adaptive appearance model, an adaptive velocity motion model with adaptive noise variance, and an adaptive number of particles. the adaptive-velocity model is derived using a first-order linear predictor based on the appearance difference between the incoming observation and the previous particle configuration. occlusion analysis is implemented using robust statistics. experimental results on tracking visual objects in long outdoor and indoor video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracking algorithm. we then perform simultaneous tracking and recognition by embedding them in a particle filter. for recognition purposes, we model the appearance changes between frames and gallery images by constructing the intra- and extrapersonal spaces. accurate recognition is achieved when confronted by pose and view variations.
long-term health effects of exposure to naphthalene background and status of naphthalene as a toxic air contaminant and potential carcinogen naphthalene naphthalene is a toxicant with unusual species and tissue specificity that has been the subject ofin vitro studies. we describe a preliminary physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model for naphthalene constructed solely fromin vitro data for comparison to animal data without the use of adjustable parameters. the prototypical pbpk model containing five lumped tissue compartments was developed to describe the uptake and metabolism of naphthalene by mice and rats dosed intraperitoneally (ip) and orally (po). the model incorporates circulation and biotransformation of the semistable reactive intermediate, naphthalene oxide, as well as the parent compound naphthalene. circulation is included because the toxic action of naphthalene has been proposed to be caused by the formation of a reactive metabolite in one organ (liver) and its circulation to another organ (lung) being adversely affected by the metabolite. the model allows conversion of naphthalene oxide into dihydrodiol, glutathione (gsh) conjugates, 1-naphthol (nonenzymatically) and covalently bound adducts with proteins. model simulations are compared with previously reportedin vivo measurements of glutathione depletion, mercapturic acid formation, and covalently bound protein formation. the mouse model predicts accurately the amount of mercapturates excreted, the effect of various pretreatments, and the extent of covalent binding in the lung and liver resulting from ip administration, including the sharp increase in binding between 200 and 400 mg/kg.
exploring theories with a model-finding assistant mace is a program that searches for finite models of first-order statements. the statement to be modeled is first translated to clauses, then to relational clauses; finally for the given domain size, the ground instances are constructed. a davis-putnam-loveland-logeman procedure decides the propositional problem, and any models found are translated to first-order models. mace is a useful complement to the theorem prover otter, with otter searching for proofs and mace looking for countermodels.
splinter: practical private queries on public data this paper presents riposte, a new system for anonymous broadcast messaging. riposte is the first such system, to our knowledge, that simultaneously protects against traffic-analysis attacks, prevents anonymous denial-of-service by malicious clients, and scales to million-user anonymity sets. to achieve these properties, riposte makes novel use of techniques used in systems for private information retrieval and secure multi-party computation. for latency-tolerant workloads with many more readers than writers (e.g. twitter, wikileaks), we demonstrate that a three-server riposte cluster can build an anonymity set of 2,895,216 users in 32 hours.
the evolving roles and controversies of radiotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma glioblastoma multiforme (gbm), the most common primary brain tumor in adults, has a median survival rate of 12 months, even with aggressive resection and radiation therapy (fig. 1a). regrettably, outcomes for this disease have not substantially improved since the brain tumor study group published their results over 25 years ago. the current standard of care for gbm consists of surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. although numerous phase iii trials have attempted to demonstrate the benefit of employing chemotherapy in these patients, either concomitantly with radiotherapy or as isolated adjuvant treatment, a significant prolongation of survival has never been documented.        figure 1        stupp and colleagues investigated the use of temozolomide (fig. 1b) as an adjuvant to radiotherapy in patients with gbm and recently published their findings in the new england journal of medicine (1). in this multi-institutional randomized clinical trial, 573 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed gbm received either radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus concomitant temozolomide. results demonstrated a median overall survival of 14.6 months (95% ci 13.2–16.8) for patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12.1 months (95% ci 11.2–13.0) for those treated with radiotherapy alone. more importantly, the two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent (95% ci 21.2–31.7) for patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to only 10.4 percent (95% ci 6.8–14.1) for those treated with radiotherapy alone. the calculated hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (p < 0.001). of note, only 7 percent of patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy experienced grade iii/iv hematologic toxic effects. based on these findings, the authors concluded that the addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for gbm leads to survival benefits that are both clinically and statistically significant with minimal additional toxicity. it is important to note, however, that patients with poor preoperative neurological status undergoing biopsy only are unlikely to benefit. moreover, it remains unclear whether the addition of chemotherapy increases the risk of radiation induced cognitive deficits.    in the same issue of the new england journal of medicine, hegi and colleagues investigated the relationship between promoter methylation of the mgmt dna-repair gene and responsiveness to temozolomide (2). the authors demonstrated that the survival benefit of temozolomide is limited to those patients with tumor containing methylated mgmt promoters. among these patients, the median survival with radiotherapy and temozolomide was 21.7 months (95% ci 17.4–30.4), compared to 15.3 months with radiotherapy alone (95% ci 13.0–20.9; p = 0.007). an insignificant survival difference was demonstrated between treatment groups in patients with unmethylated mgmt promoters. this finding points to a genetic basis for the efficacy of temozolomide and underscores the role of gene expression in optimal patient selection.    although these articles represent a substantial step forward in the treatment of gbm, at this point it is too early in standard clinical practice to choose treatment according to molecular criteria alone. it is also important to remember that several factors likely contributed the studies’ findings. first, the majority of patients was otherwise healthy and had favorable prognostic variables—age less than 70 years, good performance status, and tumor debulkment. second, temozolomide is an alkylating agent. as compared to the previously tested nitrosourea drugs, this type of agent may be more effective and less toxic when administered concurrently with radiotherapy. looking ahead, the cost of this treatment may bring a considerable financial burden to the health care providers of developing economies. to this end, until available tests can readily identify the methylation status of the mgmt promoters, not all patients should be referred for this therapy. nevertheless, these studies are important contributions to the literature, supporting radiotherapy combined with temozolomide as the new platform from which innovative regimens for treating malignant gliomas are explored.
silages of pearl millet submitted to nitrogen fertilization. as an important constituent of animal feeds, fiber represents the portion of feeds that is bulky and difficult to digest. the neutral detergent fiber (ndf) method, developed over 30 years ago, is the method of choice for measuring total fiber in forages and other feeds. several modifications that were made to improve its general applicability to all feeds and others developed in individual laboratories often resulted in variability among laboratories in measuring ndf. the amylase-treated ndf (andf) method, therefore, was developed as an accurate and precise method of measuring total insoluble fiber in feeds. a collaborative study was conducted to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the andf method over the full range of animal feed materials. twelve laboratories representing research, feed company, regulatory, and commercial feed testing laboratories analyzed 11 materials as blind duplicates. the materials represented feed matrixes, including animal products; high-protein, high-fat, and high-pectin feeds; oil seeds; grains; heated by-product feeds; and legume and grass hays and silages. materials selected varied in chemical composition and contained 0–90 % andf, 1–16% ash, 1–20% crude fat, 1–40% crude protein, and 0–50 % starch. correcting results for changes in blanks and reporting results as ash-free andf organic matter (andfom) improved the repeatability and reproducibility of results when andf was <25 % . the within-laboratory repeatability standard deviation (s r) for percentage andfom in feeds varied from 0.21 to 1.82 and among-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation (s r) varied from 0.37 to 2.24. the horrat was <2 for all materials except feed materials containing >10 % fat. however, standard deviations of repeatability and reproducibility for feeds with >10% fat were similar to those of other materials. it is recommended that the andf method be accepted for official first action status.

characteristics of designated drivers and their passengers from the 2007 national roadside survey in the united states the risk ratio can be a useful statistic for summarizing the results of cross-sectional, cohort, and randomized trial studies. i discuss several methods for estimating adjusted risk ratios and show how they can be executed in stata, including 1) mantel–haenszel and inverse-variance stratified methods; 2) generalized linear regression with a log link and binomial distribution; 3) generalized linear regression with a log link, normal distribution, and robust variance estimator; 4) poisson regression with a robust variance estimator; 5) cox proportional hazards regression with a robust variance estimator; 6) standardized risk ratios from logistic, probit, complementary log-log, and log-log regression; and 7) a substitution method. advantages and drawbacks are noted for some methods.
interactions between the dorsal and the ventral pathways in mental rotation: an fmri study subjects were required to discriminate previously learned "standard" versions of angular shapes from randomly perturbed "distractor" versions that varied in similarity to the standard. advance information concerning the identity and the orientation of the test form was provided. subjects were instructed to prepare for the presentation of the test form by mentally rotating an internal representation of the designated standard form (identity cue) into the designated orientation. the time needed to prepare for the presentation of the test form increased linearly with the angular departure of the indicated orientation from a previously learned position. this finding suggests that, in accordance with instructions, subjects performed a mental rotation in preparing for the upcoming test shape. rate of preparation was not affected by the complexity of the standard form presented as the identity cue. discriminative departure of the test form presented as the identity cue. discriminative reaction time was not affected by either test-form complexity or angular departure of the test form from the learned orientation. in addition, striking individual differences in the pattern of discriminative reaction times were found. the implications of these results for (a) the nature of the processes and representations underlying the mental rotation task and (b) the nature of visual comparison processes are discussed.

cross-modality based celebrity face naming for news image collections this paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. there are three key contributions. the first is the introduction of a new image representation called the “integral image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. the second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the adaboost learning algorithm (freund and schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. the third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. a set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. the system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (sung and poggio, 1998; rowley et al., 1998; schneiderman and kanade, 2000; roth et al., 2000). implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.
interprocedural analysis and the verification of concurrent programs the reachability problem is undecidable for programs with both recursive procedures and multiple threads with shared memory. approaches to this problem have been the focus of much recent research. one of these is to use context-bounded reachability, i.e. to consider only those runs in which the active thread changes at most ktimes, where kis fixed. however, to the best of our knowledge, context-bounded reachability has not been implemented in any tool so far, primarily because its worst-case runtime is prohibitively high, i.e. o(nk), where nis the size of the shared memory. moreover, existing algorithms for context-bounded reachability do not admit a meaningful symbolic implementation (e.g., using bdds) to reduce the run-time in practice. in this paper, we propose an improvement that overcomes this problem. we have implemented our approach in the tool jmoped and report on experiments.

taurodeoxycholate modulates apical cl−/oh− exchange activity in caco2 cells the present studies were undertaken to examine the possible regulation of apical membrane cl-/oh- exchanger in caco-2 cells by protein kinase c (pkc). the effect of the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma), an in vitro pkc agonist, on oh- gradient-driven 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (dids)-sensitive 36cl uptake in caco-2 cells was assessed. the results demonstrated that pma decreased apical cl-/oh- exchanger activity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-kinase)-mediated activation of pkcepsilon. the data consistent with these conclusions are as follows: 1) short-term treatment of cells for 1-2 h with pma (100 nm) significantly decreased cl-/oh- exchange activity compared with control (4alpha-pma); 2) pretreatment of cells with specific pkc inhibitors chelerythrine chloride, calphostin c, and gf-109203x completely blocked the inhibition of cl-/oh- exchange activity by pma; 3) specific inhibitors for pkcepsilon (ro-318220) but not pkcalpha (go-6976) significantly blocked the pma-mediated inhibition; 4) specific pi3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and ly-294002 significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of pma; and 5) pi3-kinase activators irs-1 peptide and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [pi(3,4,5)p(3)] mimicked the effects of pma. these findings provide the first evidence for pkcepsilon-mediated inhibition of cl-/oh- exchange activity in caco-2 cells and indicate the involvement of the pi3-kinase-mediated pathways in the regulation of cl- absorption in intestinal epithelial cells.
organization of the drosophila larval visual circuit recent studies in drosophila melanogaster indicate that the neuropeptide pigment‐dispersing factor (pdf) is an important output signal from a set of major clock neurons, s‐lnvs (small ventral lateral neurons), which transmit the circadian phase to subsets of other clock neurons, dns (dorsal neurons). both s‐lnvs and dns have fiber projections to the dorsal protocerebrum of the brain, so that this area is a conspicuous locus for coupling between different subsets of clock neurons. to unravel the neural circuits underlying the fly's circadian rhythms, we examined the detailed subcellular morphology of the pdf‐positive fibers of the s‐lnvs in the dorsal protocerebrum, focusing on their synaptic connections, using preembedding immunoelectron microscopy. to examine the distribution of synapses, we also reconstructed the three‐dimensional morphology of pdf‐positive varicosities from fiber profiles in the dorsal protocerebrum. the varicosities contained large dense‐core vesicles (dcvs), and also numerous small clear vesicles, forming divergent output synapses onto unlabeled neurites. the dcvs apparently dock at nonsynaptic sites, suggesting their nonsynaptic release. in addition, a 3d reconstruction revealed the presence of input synapses onto the pdf‐positive fibers. these were detected less frequently than output sites. these observations suggest that the pdf‐positive clock neurons receive neural inputs directly through synaptic connections in the dorsal protocerebrum, in addition to supplying dual outputs, either synaptic or via paracrine release of the dcv contents, to unidentified target neurons. j. comp. neurol. 518:292–304, 2010. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
least distortion halftone image data hiding watermarking by optimizing an iterative linear gain control model in this paper, a high-capacity data hiding is proposed for embedding a large amount of information into halftone images. the embedded watermark can be distributed into several error-diffused images with the proposed minimal-error bit-searching technique (mebs). the method can also be generalized to self-decoding mode with dot diffusion or color halftone images. from the experiments, the embedded capacity from 33% up to 50% and good quality results are achieved. furthermore, the proposed mebs method is also extended for robust watermarking against the degradation from printing-and-scanning and several kinds of distortions. finally, a least-mean square-based halftoning is developed to produce an edge-enhanced halftone image, and the technique also cooperates with mebs for all the applications described above, including high-capacity data hiding with secret sharing or self-decoding mode, as well as robust watermarking. the results prove much sharper than the error diffusion or dot diffusion methods.
effects of pictorial cues on reaching depend on the distinctiveness of target objects the perception/action model is the dominant account of the primary division of labour in the human visual pathway. integral to this model is the idea that goal-directed actions are guided spatially by bottom-up vision, independent of perceptual recognition and top-down object knowledge. we question this idea by showing that the expected size of familiar objects (matchboxes) affects the amplitude of reaches made to grasp them, and the pre-shaping of the hand, even when binocular cues are available. this suggests that perceptual recognition routinely influences action programming.
death following traumatic brain injury in drosophila is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction in mammals, the pgc-1 transcriptional coactivators are key regulators of energy metabolism, including mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, which have been implicated in numerous pathogenic conditions, including neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. here, we show that overexpression of the drosophila pgc-1 homolog (dpgc-1/spargel) is sufficient to increase mitochondrial activity. moreover, tissue-specific overexpression of dpgc-1 in stem and progenitor cells within the digestive tract extends life span. long-lived flies overexpressing dpgc-1 display a delay in the onset of aging-related changes in the intestine, leading to improved tissue homeostasis in old flies. together, these results demonstrate that dpgc-1 can slow aging both at the level of cellular changes in an individual tissue and also at the organismal level by extending life span. our findings point to the possibility that alterations in pgc-1 activity in high-turnover tissues, such as the intestine, may be an important determinant of longevity in mammals.
error detection and accuracy estimation in automatic speech recognition using deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks we describe the automatic determination of a large and complicated acoustic model for speech recognition by using variational bayesian estimation and clustering (vbec) for speech recognition. we propose an efficient method for decision tree clustering based on a gaussian mixture model (gmm) and an efficient model search algorithm for finding an appropriate acoustic model topology within the vbec framework. gmm-based decision tree clustering for triphone hmm states features a novel approach designed to reduce the overly large number of computations to a practical level by utilizing the statistics of monophone hidden markov model states. the model search algorithm also reduces the search space by utilizing the characteristics of the acoustic model. the experimental results confirmed that vbec automatically and rapidly yielded an optimum model topology with the highest performance.
the loss of architectural knowledge during system evolution: an industrial case study the purpose of this paper is to build the foundation for software architecture. we first develop an intuition for software architecture by appealing to several well-established architectural disciplines. on the basis of this intuition, we present a model of software architecture that consists of three components: elements, form, and rationale. elements are either processing, data, or connecting elements. form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the relationships among, the elements --- that is, the constraints on the elements. the rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints, which most often derive from the system requirements. we discuss the components of the model in the context of both architectures and architectural styles and present an extended example to illustrate some important architecture and style considerations. we conclude by presenting some of the benefits of our approach to software architecture, summarizing our contributions, and relating our approach to other current work.
virulence gene profiles: alpha-hemolysin and clonal diversity in staphylococcus aureus isolates from bovine clinical mastitis in china staphylococcus aureus is recognized worldwide as a pathogen causing many serious diseases in humans and animals and is one of the most common etiological agents of clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis. the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of genes encoding clfa, fnba, fnbb, cap5, cap8, hla, hlb, nuc, sea, and tst of s. aureus strains (n = 39) isolated from bovine clinical mastitis in guangxi by polymerase chain reaction amplification. the results of the present study indicated that all isolates were found to contain one or more virulence-associated genes. the most frequently encountered genes were fnba (97 %) and nuc (90 %), followed by hla (85 %) and hlb (82 %), respectively. none of the investigated s. aureus strains harbored fnbb and sea genes. the data in the present study showed a relatively wide distribution of the genes fnba and nuc among the investigated isolates, indicating that they play an important role on bovine mastitis pathogenesis. the study provides a valuable insight into the virulence-associated genes of this important pathogen.
historical temperature variability affects coral response to heat stress the most severe outcome of coral bleaching is colony mortality. however, the risk of mortality is one of the least understood consequences for reef corals under climate-change scenarios. specifically, links among combinations of temperature anomalies, varying solar irradiance, reduced water quality, and mortality risks are unclear. here, we analyze the effects of high temperature, irradiance, and sediment loading on coral survivorship in a controlled tank experiment using acropora intermedia from the inner great barrier reef lagoon. survival analyses based on the fate of 1600 subcolonies revealed that temperature and sediment exerted strong effects on coral mortality risk. as expected, high temperature increased mortality risk at all light and sediment levels. however, high sediment reduced mortality under high temperature and/or high light, potentially by alleviating light pressure and by providing an alternative food source for bleached corals. a survivorship model using coral energy status (lipid stores) as a predictor variable provided an excellent fit to the data, suggesting that much of the variation in survivorship among treatments and over time can be explained by colony energetics. our study provides a new framework for predicting coral mortality risk under complex bleaching scenarios in which multiple environmental variables are involved.
ionization and recombination with electrons: laboratory measurements and observational consequences the iron l-shell ions (fe17+ to fe23+) play an important role in determin- ing the thermal and ionization structures and line emission from photoionized plasmas. current uncertainties in the theoretical low temperature dielectronic recombination (dr) rate coefficients for these ions significantly affect our ability to model and inter- pret the line emission from observations of photoionized plasmas. to help resolve this issue, we have initiated a program of laboratory measurements to produce reliable low temperature dr rates for the l-shell iron. here we present some of our recent results and discuss some of the astrophysical implications.
karyotypic conservatism in five species of prochilodus (characiformes, prochilodontidae) disclosed by cytogenetic markers atlantic salmon 5s ribosomal dna (5s rdna) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using as primers conserved sequences from the coding region of rainbow trout 5s rrna. two amplified products of different molecular weights were obtained, cloned, and sequenced, revealing them to be tandemly arranged. the nucleotide sequences differed between the two clones in the length of the nontranscribed spacer (nts) and in three nucleotides of the coding sequence. by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization the 5s rdna was chromosomally located in the heterochromatic arm of the pair bearing the satellite, adjacent to the major ribosomal dna locus (rdna).
ld2snping: linkage disequilibrium plotter and rflp enzyme mining for tag snps in response to a need for a general catalog of genome variation to address the large-scale sampling designs required by association studies, gene mapping and evolutionary biology, the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) has established the dbsnp database [s.t.sherry, m.ward and k. sirotkin (1999) genome res., 9, 677-679]. submissions to dbsnp will be integrated with other sources of information at ncbi such as genbank, pubmed, locuslink and the human genome project data. the complete contents of dbsnp are available to the public at website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp. the complete contents of dbsnp can also be downloaded in multiple formats via anonymous ftp at ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/.
participation , precedence and co-ordination in dialogue abstract this paper explores how conversants co-ordinate their use and interpretation of language in a restricted context. it revolves around the analysis of the spatial descriptions which emerge during the course of 56 dialogues, elicited in the laboratory using a specially designed computer maze game. two types of analysis are reported. the first is a semantic analysis of the various types of description, which indicates how pairs of speakers develop different language schemes associated with different mental models of the maze configuration. the second analysis concerns how the communicants co-ordinate in developing their description schemes. the results from this study would suggest that language processing in dialogue may be governed by local principles of interaction which have received little attention in the psychological and linguistic literature to date.

pif3 is involved in the primary root growth inhibition of arabidopsis induced by nitric oxide in the light use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to amplify cdna products reverse transcribed from mrna is on the way to becoming a routine tool in molecular biology to study low abundance gene expression. real-time pcr is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. but accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. this study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time rt-pcr of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. the relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time pcr efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. this model needs no calibration curve. control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to rna integrity, sample loading and inter-pcr variations. high accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5% variation) were reached in lightcycler pcr using the established mathematical model.
cobrapy: constraints-based reconstruction and analysis for python cellular response to genetic and environmental perturbations is often reflected and/or mediated through changes in the metabolism, because the latter plays a key role in providing gibbs free energy and precursors for biosynthesis. such metabolic changes are often exerted through transcriptional changes induced by complex regulatory mechanisms coordinating the activity of different metabolic pathways. it is difficult to map such global transcriptional responses by using traditional methods, because many genes in the metabolic network have relatively small changes at their transcription level. we therefore developed an algorithm that is based on hypothesis-driven data analysis to uncover the transcriptional regulatory architecture of metabolic networks. by using information on the metabolic network topology from genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, we show that it is possible to reveal patterns in the metabolic network that follow a common transcriptional response. thus, the algorithm enables identification of so-called reporter metabolites (metabolites around which the most significant transcriptional changes occur) and a set of connected genes with significant and coordinated response to genetic or environmental perturbations. we find that cells respond to perturbations by changing the expression pattern of several genes involved in the specific part(s) of the metabolism in which a perturbation is introduced. these changes then are propagated through the metabolic network because of the highly connected nature of metabolism.
sparse learning of maximum likelihood model for optimization of complex loss function classification and decision systems in data analysis are mostly based on accuracy optimization. this criterion is only a conditional informative value if the data are imbalanced or false positive/negative decisions cause different costs. therefore more sophisticated statistical quality measures are favored in medicine, like precision, recall etc.. otherwise, most classification approaches in machine learning are designed for accuracy optimization. in this paper we consider variants of learning vector quantizers (lvqs) explicitly optimizing those advanced statistical quality measures while keeping the basic intuitive ingredients of these classifiers, which are the prototype based principle and the hebbian learning. in particular we focus in this contribution particularly to precision and recall as important measures for use in medical applications. we investigate these problems in terms of precision-recall curves as well as receiver-operating characteristic (roc) curves well-known in statistical classification and test analysis. with the underlying more general framework, we provide a principled alternatives traditional classifiers, such that a closer connection to statistical classification analysis can be drawn.
design and evaluation of prophylactic interventions using infectious disease incidence data from close contact groups. for the first wave of pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist influenza attack, antiviral agents would be one of the few options to contain the epidemic in the united states until adequate supplies of vaccine were available. the authors use stochastic epidemic simulations to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis to contain influenza. in this strategy, close contacts of suspected index influenza cases take antiviral agents prophylactically. the authors compare targeted antiviral prophylaxis with vaccination strategies. they model an influenza pandemic or bioterrorist attack for an agent similar to influenza a virus (h2n2) that caused the asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958. in the absence of intervention, the model predicts an influenza illness attack rate of 33% of the population (95% confidence interval (ci): 30, 37) and an influenza death rate of 0.58 deaths/1,000 persons (95% cl: 0.4, 0.8). with the use of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, if 80% of the exposed persons maintained prophylaxis for up to 8 weeks, the epidemic would be contained, and the model predicts a reduction to an illness attack rate of 2% (95% cl: 0.2, 16) and a death rate of 0.04 deaths/1,000 persons (95% ci: 0.0003, 0.25). such antiviral prophylaxis is nearly as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. vaccinating 80% of the children aged less than 19 years is almost as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. targeted antiviral prophylaxis has potential as an effective measure for containing influenza until adequate quantities of vaccine are available.
semantically-enhanced model-experiment-evaluation processes (semeeps) within the atmospheric chemistry community abstract. model-measurement comparisons of hox in extremely clean air ([no] the free-radical chemistry was studied using a zero-dimensional box-model based upon the master chemical mechanism (mcm). two versions of the model were used, with different levels of chemical complexity, to explore the role of hydrocarbons upon free-radical budgets under very clean conditions. the "detailed" model was constrained to measurements of co, ch4 and 17 nmhcs, while the "simple" model contained only the co and ch4 oxidation mechanisms, together with inorganic chemistry. the oh and ho2 (hox) concentrations predicted by the two models agreed to within 5–10%. the model results were compared with the hox concentrations measured by the fage (fluorescence assay by gas expansion) technique during four days of clean southern ocean marine boundary layer (mbl) air. the models overestimated oh concentrations by about 10% on two days and about 20% on the other two days. ho2 concentrations were measured during two of these days and the models overestimated the measured concentrations by about 40%. better agreement with measured ho2 was observed by using data from several mbl aerosol measurements to estimate the aerosol surface area and by increasing the ho2 uptake coefficient to unity. this reduced the modelled ho2 overestimate by ~40%, with little effect on oh, because of the poor ho2 to oh conversion at the low ambient nox concentrations. local sensitivity analysis and morris one-at-a-time analysis were performed on the "simple" model, and showed the importance of reliable measurements of j(o1d) and [hcho] and of the kinetic parameters that determine the efficiency of o(1d) to oh and hcho to ho2 conversion. a 2σ standard deviation of 30–40% for oh and 25–30% for ho2 was estimated for the model calculations using a monte carlo technique coupled with latin hypercube sampling (lhs).
the relationship between older americans act in-home services and low-care residents in nursing homes purpose of the study to examine the relationship between county-level medicaid home- and community-based service (hcbs) waiver expenditures and the prevalence of low-care residents in florida nursing homes (nhs).   design and methods the present study used a cross-sectional design. we combined two data sources: nh facility-level data (including characteristics of the facility and its residents) and county-level market characteristics (including hcbs waiver expenditures) for 653 florida nhs in 2007. low-care was defined as residents who require no physical assistance in any of the 4 late-loss activities of daily living (bed mobility, toileting, transferring, and eating). we estimated a 2-level hierarchical linear model (hlm) to examine the relationship between medicaid hcbs waiver expenditures and the prevalence of low-care residents while accounting for resident assessment, facility-, and county-level covariates.   results all florida counties offered 2 statewide waivers, and 33 counties offered one or more of the 4 regional medicaid hcbs waivers in 2007. per-month beneficiary expenditures ranged from $755 to $1,778. the average florida nh had 120 beds, and 8.0% of its residents were classified as low-care. results from the hlm model showed that a $10,000 increase in per-enrollee hcbs waiver expenditures was associated with a 3.5 percentage point reduction in low-care resident prevalence (p = .03).   implications the findings suggest that medicaid hcbs waiver programs may reduce the prevalence of low-care residents in nhs. future studies should evaluate whether medicaid hcbs waiver programs are effective in promoting community-living among low-care residents and mitigating the growth in long-term care expenditures.
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
applying cross-entropy difference for selecting parallel training data from publicly available sources for conversational machine translation human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused. we propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. we present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.
genetic predictors of response to serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants in major depressive disorder: a genome-wide analysis of individual-level data and a meta-analysis whole-genome association studies (wgas) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. to address these issues, we developed plink, an open-source c/c++ wgas tool set. with plink, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. as well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, plink also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. we introduce plink and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. in particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. this information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.
money distributions in chaotic economies abstract:we consider a simple model of a closed economic system where the total money is conserved and the number of economic agents is fixed. analogous to statistical systems in equilibrium, money and the average money per economic agent are equivalent to energy and temperature, respectively. we investigate the effect of the saving propensity of the agents on the stationary or equilibrium probability distribution of money. when the agents do not save, the equilibrium money distribution becomes the usual gibb's distribution, characteristic of non-interacting agents. however with saving, even for individual self-interest, the dynamics becomes cooperative and the resulting asymmetric gaussian-like stationary distribution acquires global ordering properties. intriguing singularities are observed in the stationary money distribution in the market, as functions of the marginal saving propensity of the agents.
similarities in early course among men and women with a first episode of schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder the global assessment scale (gas) is a rating scale for evaluating the overall functioning of a subject during a specified time period on a continuum from psychological or psychiatric sickness to health. in five studies encompassing the range of population to which measures of overall severity of illness are likely to be applied, the gas was found to have good reliability. gas ratings were found to have a greater sensitivity to change over time than did other ratings of overall severity or specific symptom dimensions. former inpatients in the community with a gas rating below 40 had a higher probability of readmission to the hospital than did patients with higher gas scores. the relative simplicity, reliability, and validity of the gas suggests that it would be useful in a wide variety of clinical and research settings.
c-c chemokine receptor type 5 (ccr5) utilization of transmitted and early founder human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelopes and sensitivity to small-molecule ccr5 inhibitors identification of cellular factors involved in hiv-1 entry and transmission at mucosal surfaces is critical for understanding viral pathogenesis and development of effective prevention strategies. here we describe the evaluation of hiv-1 entry inhibitors for their ability to prevent infection of, and dissemination from, human cervical tissue ex vivo. blockade of cd4 alone or ccr5 and cxcr4 together inhibited localized mucosal infection. however, simultaneous blockade of cd4 and mannose-binding c-type lectin receptors including dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule–grabbing integrin was required to inhibit hiv-1 uptake and dissemination by migratory cells. in contrast, direct targeting of hiv-1 by neutralizing mab b12 and cd4-igg2 (pro-542) blocked both localized infection and viral dissemination pathways. flow cytometric analysis and immunostaining of migratory cells revealed two major populations, cd3+hla-dr− and cd3−hla-dr+ cells, with a significant proportion of the latter also expressing dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule–grabbing integrin. bead depletion studies demonstrated that such hla-dr+ cells accounted for as much as 90% of hiv-1 dissemination. additional studies using immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells demonstrated that although mannose-binding c-type lectin receptors and cd4 are the principal receptors for gp120, other mechanisms may account for virus capture. our identification of the predominant receptors involved in hiv-1 infection and dissemination within human cervical tissue highlight important targets for microbicide development.
comparative cytochrome p450 in vitro inhibition by atypical antipsychotic drugs abstractobjective: the aim of this study was to find whether endogenous substances could modulate cyp3a activity. there is evidence that cyp3a, a major phase-i xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, is present in human brain but, at the present time, endogenous substrates for such an enzyme remain to be identified. a possible linkage between the cyp2d6 enzyme and serotonergic transmission has been recently reported by our group. in the same manner, structurally related enzymes such as cyp3a could also be related to endogenous compounds.   methods: cyp3a activity was measured using the enzyme-specific substrate midazolam in human liver microsomes. several neurotransmitters, precursors, and their metabolites, corresponding to three different metabolic routes, were assayed as putative modulators of cyp3a enzyme activity. these comprised serotonergic, catecolaminergic, and gabaergic transmitters and precursors. the inhibitory capacity of ketoconazole, a competitive inhibitor of cyp3a, was also analyzed for comparison.   results: the kinetic analysis of the midazolam 1-hydroxylase activity measured in microsomes from five human liver samples indicated km values (mean ± sd) of 5.8 ± 4.9 μm, and vmax values of 1.7 ± 1.4 nmol min−1 per mg microsomal protein in all the samples used in the study. of the 14 substances analyzed, adrenaline, serotonin, and 5-hydroxytriptofol were full inhibitors of cyp3a enzyme activity (ki values of 42.3, 26.4, and 43 μm, respectively). the remaining substances were weak inhibitors or had no inhibitory effect.   conclusion: brain cyp3a activity could be modulated by some neurotransmitters and precursors.
enabling the hypothesis-driven prioritization of ligand candidates in big databases: screenlamp and its application to gpcr inhibitor discovery for invasive species control as an extension to a previous published study (mcgaughey et al., j chem inf model 47:1504–1519, 2007) comparing 2d and 3d similarity methods to docking, we apply a subset of those virtual screening methods (toposim, sqw, rocs-color, and glide) to a set of protein/ligand pairs where the protein is the target for docking and the cocrystallized ligand is the target for the similarity methods. each protein is represented by a maximum of five crystal structures. we search a diverse subset of the mddr as well as a diverse small subset of the mcidb, merck’s proprietary database. it is seen that the relative effectiveness of virtual screening methods, as measured by the enrichment factor, is highly dependent on the particular crystal structure or ligand, and on the database being searched. 2d similarity methods appear very good for the mddr, but poor for the mcidb. however, rocs-color (a 3d similarity method) does well for both databases.
atp production after ultraviolet irradiation inescherichia coli uv-irradiation of e. coli induces a two fold increase in atp pool in the first 20 min. afterwards, in reca+ strains atp level drops quickly below values of non irradiated cells. mutants of e. coli defective in reca protein or with either reca protease activity deficient or protease resistant lexa repressor do not present this decrease, showing that it is due to cleavage of lexa repressor by reca protease. the atp increase produced in the first 20 min is dependent on recbc exonuclease activity and it must be due to substrate level phosphorylation since an uncoupler such as dinitrophenol does not affect it.
are mammal olfactory signals hiding right under our noses? while assessing a potential role of adrenal glands in the production of the hitherto unidentified puberty-delaying pheromone of female mice, the urinary volatile profiles of normal and adrenalectomized animals were quantitatively compared. six components, whose concentrations were depressed after adrenalectomy, were identified: 2-heptanone, trans-5-hepten-2-one, trans-4-hepten-2-one, n-pentyl acetate, cis-2-penten-1-yl acetate, and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine. when these laboratory-synthesized chemicals were added (in their natural concentrations) to either previously inactive urine from adrenalectomized females or plain water, the biological activity was fully restored.
phylogenetic information and experimental design in molecular systematics summarythe application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed. a computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. this method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. it also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.
nrf2-mediated notch pathway activation enhances hematopoietic reconstitution following myelosuppressive radiation. background chronic kidney disease (ckd) associated with type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, with both inflammation and oxidative stress contributing to disease progression. bardoxolone methyl, an oral antioxidant inflammation modulator, has shown efficacy in patients with ckd and type 2 diabetes in short-term studies, but longer-term effects and dose response have not been determined.   methods in this phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 227 adults with ckd (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [gfr] of 20 to 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or bardoxolone methyl at a target dose of 25, 75, or 150 mg once daily. the primary outcome was the change from baseline in the estimated gfr with bardoxolone methyl, as compared with placebo, at 24 weeks; a secondary outcome was the change at 52 weeks.   results patients receiving bardoxolone methyl had significant increases in the mean (±sd) estimated gfr, as compared with placebo, at 24 weeks (with between-group differences per minute per 1.73 m(2) of 8.2±1.5 ml in the 25-mg group, 11.4±1.5 ml in the 75-mg group, and 10.4±1.5 ml in the 150-mg group; p<0.001). the increases were maintained through week 52, with significant differences per minute per 1.73 m(2) of 5.8±1.8 ml, 10.5±1.8 ml, and 9.3±1.9 ml, respectively. muscle spasms, the most frequent adverse event in the bardoxolone methyl groups, were generally mild and dose-related. hypomagnesemia, mild increases in alanine aminotransferase levels, and gastrointestinal effects were more common among patients receiving bardoxolone methyl.   conclusions bardoxolone methyl was associated with improvement in the estimated gfr in patients with advanced ckd and type 2 diabetes at 24 weeks. the improvement persisted at 52 weeks, suggesting that bardoxolone methyl may have promise for the treatment of ckd.

effect of adiposity on insulin action after acute and chronic resistance exercise in non-diabetic women we examined insulin action/secretion and cardiovascular disease risk factors in japanese subjects with impaired fasting glucose (ifg) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (igt) who were not taking any medications known to affect glucose tolerance, blood pressure (bp) or plasma lipids (pls). a total of 1,399 subjects received measurements of anthropometry, bp, pls, and plasma glucose/insulin concentrations during 75 g-oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt). according to 2003 american diabetes association criteria, subjects were classified as having normal fasting glucose (nfg)/normal glucose tolerance (ngt) (n=1,173), ifg (n=128), igt (n=55), and ifg/igt (n=43). insulin action was calculated using the homa-r (index of hepatic insulin resistance) and matsuda index (reflects whole body insulin sensitivity). the ratio of the incremental area under the curve of insulin to that of glucose during ogtt (δaucpi/δaucpg) was used as an index of β-cell function. homa-r was higher in ifg (2.3±0.1) and ifg/igt (2.5±0.2) than in nfg/ngt (1.8±0.03). the matsuda index was lower in ifg (6.5±0.3), igt (5.4±0.4) and ifg/igt (5.1±0.5) than in nfg/ngt (9.6±0.2). δaucpi/δaucpg was lower in igt (0.6±0.05) and ifg/igt (0.5±0.05) than in ifg (1.4±0.12) or nfg/ngt (1.2±0.03). mean bp was higher in igt (100±1.7 mmhg) than in nfg/ngt (91±0.3) or ifg (95±1.1). the plasma triglyceride level was higher in igt (155±14 mg/dl) and igt/ifg (173±12) than in ifg (132±7) or nfg/ngt (122±2). in conclusion, 1) whole body insulin sensitivity is decreased in ifg and igt, with a greater reduction in igt, 2) hepatic insulin resistance and preserved β-cell function are characteristics of ifg, and 3) higher bp and triglyceride levels are observed in igt. igt is more closely associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease than is ifg.
multiple anti-interferon actions of the influenza a virus ns1 protein the nonstructural protein ns1 of influenza virus is an antagonist of host immune responses and is implicated in virulence. it has two domains, an n-terminal double-stranded rna–binding domain (rbd) and an effector domain crucial for rbd function, for nuclear export and for sequestering messenger rna–processing proteins. here we present the crystallographic structure of the effector domain, which has a novel fold and suggests mechanisms for increased virulence in h5n1 strains.
association between brain volumes and hand in cart-naïve hiv+ individuals from thailand in the course of the preparatory work for the who cross-cultural study on the neuropsychiatric aspects of hiv-i infection, two new neuropsychological tests (the who/ucla auditory verbal learning test and the color trails 1 & 2) were developed. the evaluation of these tests was performed at four sites, two in developed and two in developing countries. the data obtained suggest that the tests are more culture fair than others currently used to assess the same functional domains, that they are sensitive to hiv-1-associated cognitive impairment, and that this sensitivity "holds" across different cultures.
structural evidence for mechanisms to redistribute hepatic and ductus venosus blood flows in nonhuman primate fetuses. doppler studies of the ductus venosus are increasingly being integrated in the assessment of fetal well‐being. establishing the precise morphology and structure of the ductus venosus would provide a better understanding of doppler findings during fetal adaptation. there is conflicting evidence from previous studies about the structure of the ductus venosus, especially with regard to the presence of a sphincter at the ductus venosus inlet. the aim of this study was to examine the morphology and histological structure of the ductus venosus wall and surrounding tissues at 13–17 weeks' gestation.
mightyl: a compositional translation from mitl to timed automata in recent years, the ltsmin model checker has been extended with support for several new modelling languages, including probabilistic mapa and timed systems uppaal. also, connecting additional language front-ends or ad-hoc state-space generators to ltsmin was simplified using custom c-code. from symbolic and distributed reachability analysis and minimisation, ltsmin's functionality has developed into a model checker with multi-core algorithms for on-the-fly ltl checking with partial-order reduction, and multi-core symbolic checking for the modal μ calculus, based on the multi-core decision diagram package sylvan.    in ltsmin, the modelling languages and the model checking algorithms are connected through a partitioned next-state interface pins, that allows to abstract away from language details in the implementation of the analysis algorithms and on-the-fly optimisations. in the current paper, we present an overview of the toolset and its recent changes, and we demonstrate its performance and versatility in two case studies.
investigating commercial cellulase performances toward specific biomass recalcitrance factors using reference substrates in this study, chemical pulping techniques were applied to create a set of biomass substrates with intact lignocellulosic fibers and controlled morphological and chemical properties to allow the investigation of the individual effects of xylan and surface lignin content on enzymatic hydrolysis. a high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique was established for quantifying surface lignin content on lignocellulosic biomass substrates. the results from this study show that, apart from its hindrance effect, xylan can facilitate cellulose fibril swelling and thus create more accessible surface area, which improves enzyme and substrate interactions. surface lignin has a direct impact on enzyme adsorption kinetics and hydrolysis rate. advanced understanding of xylan and surface lignin effects provides critical information for developing more effective biomass conversion process.
the impact of topic bias on quality flaw prediction in wikipedia the detection and improvement of low-quality information is a key concern in web applications that are based on user-generated content; a popular example is the online encyclopedia wikipedia. existing research on quality assessment of user-generated content deals with the classification as to whether the content is high-quality or low-quality. this paper goes one step further: it targets the prediction of quality flaws, this way providing specific indications in which respects low-quality content needs improvement. the prediction is based on user-defined cleanup tags, which are commonly used in many web applications to tag content that has some shortcomings. we apply this approach to the english wikipedia, which is the largest and most popular user-generated knowledge source on the web. we present an automatic mining approach to identify the existing cleanup tags, which provides us with a training corpus of labeled wikipedia articles. we argue that common binary or multiclass classification approaches are ineffective for the prediction of quality flaws and hence cast quality flaw prediction as a one-class classification problem. we develop a quality flaw model and employ a dedicated machine learning approach to predict wikipedia's most important quality flaws. since in the wikipedia setting the acquisition of significant test data is intricate, we analyze the effects of a biased sample selection. in this regard we illustrate the classifier effectiveness as a function of the flaw distribution in order to cope with the unknown (real-world) flaw-specific class imbalances. the flaw prediction performance is evaluated with 10,000 wikipedia articles that have been tagged with the ten most frequent quality flaws: provided test data with little noise, four flaws can be detected with a precision close to 1.
network-based predictions and simulations by biological state space models: search for drug mode of action we propose a statistical method based on graphical gaussian models for estimating large gene networks from dna microarray data. in estimating large gene networks, the number of genes is larger than the number of samples, we need to consider some restrictions for model building. we propose weighted lasso estimation for the graphical gaussian models as a model of large gene networks. in the proposed method, the structural learning for gene networks is equivalent to the selection of the regularization parameters included in the weighted lasso estimation. we investigate this problem from a bayes approach and derive an empirical bayesian information criterion for choosing them. unlike bayesian network approach, our method can find the optimal network structure and does not require to use heuristic structural learning algorithm. we conduct monte carlo simulation to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. we also analyze arabidopsis thaliana microarray data and estimate gene networks.
quadratic regularization with cubic descent for unconstrained optimization ∗ in this work we propose a class of quasi-newton methods to minimize a twice differentiable function with lipschitz continuous hessian. these methods are based on the quadratic regularization of newton’s method, with algebraic explicit rules for computing the regularizing parameter. the convergence properties of this class of methods are analysed. we show that if the sequence generated by the algorithm converges then its limit point is stationary. we also establish local quadratic convergence in a neighborhood of a stationary point with positive definite hessian. encouraging numerical experiments are presented.
ensembl comparative genomics resources the mouse genome analysis consortium aligned the human and mouse genome sequences for a variety of purposes, using alignment programs that suited the various needs. for investigating issues regarding genome evolution, a particularly sensitive method was needed to permit alignment of a large proportion of the neutrally evolving regions. we selected a program called blastz, an independent implementation of the gapped blast algorithm specifically designed for aligning two long genomic sequences. blastz was subsequently modified, both to attain efficiency adequate for aligning entire mammalian genomes and to increase its sensitivity. this work describes blastz, its modifications, the hardware environment on which we run it, and several empirical studies to validate its results.
trends in eye tracking scanpaths: segmentation effect? in this paper we describe block-o-matic, a web page segmentation framework. it is a hybrid approach inspired by automated document processing methods and visual-based content segmentation techniques. a web page is associated with three structures: the dom tree, the content structure and the logical structure. the dom tree represents the html elements of a page, the content structure organizes page objects according to content's categories and geometry and finally the logical structure is the result of mapping content structure on the basis of the human-perceptible meaning that conforms the blocks. the logic structure represents the final segmentation. the segmentation process is divided into three phases: analysis, understanding and reconstruction of a web page. an evaluation is proposed in order to perform the evaluation of web page segmentations based on a ground truth of 400 pages classified into 16 categories. block-o-matic gives promising results.
a 2-phase frame-based knowledge extraction framework this paper presents the predicate matrix v1.1, a new lexical resource resulting from the integration of multiple sources of predicate information including framenet, verbnet, propbank and wordnet. we start from the basis of semlink. then, we use advanced graph-based algorithms to further extend the mapping coverage of semlink. second, we also exploit the current content of semlink to infer new role mappings among the different predicate schemas. as a result, we have obtained a new version of the predicate matrix which largely extends the current coverage of semlink and the previous version of the predicate matrix.
the chinless mutation and neural crest cell interactions in zebrafish jaw development. preparation of small vertebrates cleared after alcian blue staining of cartilage is facilitated by trypsin digestion. specimens are fixed in formation, washed, skinned, and eviscerated. after staining in a solution of alcian blue in acetic acid-alcohol for 24-48 hours, they are transferred to water through graded alcohols. excess alcian blue is removed over a period of up to three weeks by changes every 2-3 days of 1% trypsin in approximately one-third-saturated sodium borate. bony tissues may be stained after this in a solution of alizarin red s in 0.5% koh. specimens are bleached if necessary and dehydrated through graded koh-glycerine mixtures for storage in glycerine. since alcohol treatment in addition to formalin fixation does not affect results with this method, it should be useful to researchers who want to study the cartilage or cartilaginous skeletons in museum specimens, which are routinely fixed in formalin and stored in alcohol.
brdf-shop : an artistic tool for creating physically correct brdfs we consider the rendering of diffuse objects under distant illumination, as specified by an environment map. using an analytic expression for the irradiance in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients of the lighting, we show that one needs to compute and use only 9 coefficients, corresponding to the lowest-frequency modes of the illumination, in order to achieve average errors of only 1%. in other words, the irradiance is insensitive to high frequencies in the lighting, and is well approximated using only 9 parameters. in fact, we show that the irradiance can be procedurally represented simply as a quadratic polynomial in the cartesian components of the surface normal, and give explicit formulae. these observations lead to a simple and efficient procedural rendering algorithm amenable to hardware implementation, a prefiltering method up to three orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, and new representations for lighting design and image-based rendering.
altered metabolites in the plasma of autism spectrum disorder: a capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectroscopy study metabolomics is an emerging technology that reveals homeostatic imbalances in biological systems. global determination of metabolite concentrations in body fluid and tissues provides novel anatomical aspects of pathological conditions that cannot be obtained from target-specific measurements. here, we characterised metabolic imbalance in watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic rabbits as a model of hypercholesterolaemia. using a mass spectrometry-based system, we measured a total of 335 metabolites in plasma and tissues (liver, aorta, cardiac muscle, and brain) from whhl and healthy control rabbits. from the comparison between two metabolomic profiles, pathophysiological features including glutathione and phosphatidylcholine metabolism indicated the occurrence of oxidative stress in several tissues. especially for the liver, imbalanced purine catabolism shed light on the transcriptional activation of xanthine oxidase, which is thought to act in absorbing or possibly triggering oxidative stress. we also applied this system to assess the therapeutic effects of simvastatin administration. after the treatment, a portion of the metabolomic features in pathological conditions showed alterations suggesting restoration of metabolism to the healthy condition. these changes were considered to be due to the pleiotropic action of statin, including antioxidant effects, rather than its main inhibitory action on cholesterol biosynthesis.

brain heparanase expression is up‐regulated during postnatal development and hypoxia‐induced neovascularization in adult rats neuroprotective functions of erythropoietin (epo) are thought to involve a heteroreceptor composed of both epo receptor (epo-r) and common beta chain (betac). here, we measured the response of hippocampal epo system components (epo, epo-r and betac) during neurodegenerative processes following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (se), and examined whether recombinant human epo (rhuepo) could support neuronal survival. we evidence that epo is induced in astroglia following se, in particular within areas displaying delayed neuronal death. in addition, we demonstrate for the first time that rhuepo reduces considerably hippocampal neurodegeneration following se. rhuepo may thus supplement astroglial induction of epo to promote enhanced hippocampal neuronal survival following se. we also show that epo-r is expressed by neurons and astrocytes mainly, while betac is barely detectable in basal conditions and induced in reactive microglia exclusively following se. altogether, our results suggest that epo/rhuepo exerts neuroprotection, through epo-r signaling and independently of betac, and, therefore, may be anti-epileptogenic.
bh3 mimetics antagonizing restricted prosurvival bcl-2 proteins represent another class of selective immune modulatory drugs in this report, we detail changes in the expression of cd38 on murine b cells during the course of a t cell-dependent immune response. cd38 is expressed on all naive b cells but is down-regulated on isotype-switched b cells from both the germinal centers (gcs) and the foci of ab-forming cells which arise during the first weeks of the response. the down-regulation on gc b cells, however, is reversible since ag-specific igg1 b cells with high levels of cd38 are apparent by 2 wk postimmunization. these cells have characteristics that resemble recirculating memory b cells, in that they are small and bind low levels of peanut agglutinin. such characteristics indicate that the restoration of cd38 levels is coincidental with the transition from gc to memory b cell. using this observation, we plotted the development of the memory population and the demise of the gc reaction as a function of time after immunization. our results indicate that the gc reaction ceases gradually over many weeks rather than suddenly, which corresponds with the formation of the memory b cell population. furthermore, by segregating memory b cells and gc b cells, it was possible to assess the in vitro survival characteristics of each compared with naive b cells. these experiments demonstrated that memory b cell survival in vitro was comparable with naive b cell survival but less than the survival seen for bcl-2-transgenic b cells, whereas gc b cell survival, as expected, was very poor. hence, by resolving murine ag-specific memory b cells and gc b cells, we have been able to quantify the development of the memory b cell population.
role of the mitochondrial mutations, m.827a>g and the novel m.7462c>t, in the origin of hearing loss. the genetic diversity in three african brazilian populations was analyzed using the 360-nucleotide sequences of the first hypervariable segment (hvs-i) of the mitochondrial dna control region. results from 42 individuals revealed 39 distinct lineages defined by 54 variable positions. some of the sequence types were clearly african derived, but apparent amerindian lineages also occurred. the lineage clusters did not show any association with place of residence of the individuals or with their morphological classification. nucleotide diversity, however, seemed to be associated with degree of admixture. the mismatch distribution suggests a major human population expansion 60,000 years ago.
pif3 is involved in the primary root growth inhibition of arabidopsis induced by nitric oxide in the light use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to amplify cdna products reverse transcribed from mrna is on the way to becoming a routine tool in molecular biology to study low abundance gene expression. real-time pcr is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. but accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. this study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time rt-pcr of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. the relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time pcr efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. this model needs no calibration curve. control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to rna integrity, sample loading and inter-pcr variations. high accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5% variation) were reached in lightcycler pcr using the established mathematical model.
extrapolation of mixed finite element approximations for the maxwell eigenvalue problem an element-local $l^2$-projected $c^0$ finite element method is presented to approximate the nonsmooth solution being not in $h^1$ of the maxwell problem on a nonconvex lipschitz polyhedron with reentrant corners and edges. the key idea lies in that element-local $l^2$ projectors are applied to both curl and div operators. the $c^0$ linear finite element (enriched with certain higher degree bubble functions) is employed to approximate the nonsmooth solution. the coercivity in $l^2$ norm is established uniform in the mesh-size, and the condition number ${\cal o}(h^{-2})$ of the resulting linear system is proven. for the solution and its curl in $h^r$ with $r<1$ we obtain an error bound ${\cal o}(h^r)$ in an energy norm. numerical experiments confirm the theoretical error bound.
microrna-182 targets special at-rich sequence-binding protein 2 to promote colorectal cancer proliferation and metastasis objective to isolate a subclone from human colorectal cancer cell line sw480 with unique metastatic potential in the liver.   methods human colorectal cancer cells sw480 were implanted into balb/c nude mice, and the hepatic metastatic lesions were harvested, and the tumor tissue blocks were re-implantated into nude mice for a second round of in vivo selection. the same procedure was repeated 5 times until a new cell subline, designated as sw480/m5, was established, whose biological behaviors was investigated both in vivo and in vitro.   results after orthotopic implantation of the tumor tissue into the colon of nude mouse for 28 days, widespread loco-regional and distant metastases occurred in mice inoculated with sw480 tissue, and those inoculated with sw480/m5 tissue had hepatic metastasis only. compared with the parental cells, sw480/m5 cells were characterized by greater clonality, reproductive activity, motor ability, invasiveness, and weaker adhesive capacity to fibronectin.   conclusion a human colorectal cancer cell subline with unique liver metastatic potential has been established by in vivo selection to serve as a new model for study ing colorectal cancer metastasis.
the roles of platelet-derived growth factors and their receptors in brain radiation necrosis background–brain radiation necrosis has been recognized as a potential complication of radiation therapy for cancer for at least five decades. advances in neuro-radiology and histopathology have helped characterize this problem more fully and some therapeutic interventions may help prevent progression of this pathology. this is important in achieving one of the most important goals of cancer care—maintaining quality of life. review summary–this review discusses the evolution of our understanding of radiation necrosis, from the first “autopsy-dependent” reports to the current characterization of these lesions with magnetic resonance (mr) and functional imaging. the review is presented in two parts; part i deals with the definition, incidence and presumed pathogenesis of radiation necrosis. part ii includes diagnosis on the basis of imaging characteristics, (including functional imaging) and biopsy results. management options are also explored. conclusions–radiation necrosis is a very significant complication of radiation treatment of brain cancers and may have a tremendous impact on a patient’s quality of life. the early diagnosis of radiation necrosis in patients receiving radiation therapy to the brain has improved with current neuro-imaging modalities and better understanding of its pathophysiology. the development of treatment modalities has been slower, but is nonetheless promising.
heterogeneity of h-k-atpase-mediated acid secretion along the mouse collecting duct. two classes of h pumps, h-k-atpase and h-atpase, contribute to luminal acidification and hco(3) transport in the collecting duct (cd). at least two h-k-atpase alpha-subunits are expressed in the cd: hkalpha(1) and hkalpha(2). both exhibit k dependence but have different inhibitor sensitivities. the hkalpha(1) h-k-atpase is sch-28080 sensitive, whereas the pharmacological profile of the hkalpha(2) h-k-atpase is not completely understood. the present study used a nonpharmacological, genetic approach to determine the contribution of hkalpha(1) and hkalpha(2) to cortical cd (ccd) intercalated cell (ic) proton transport in mice fed a normal diet. intracellular ph (ph(i)) recovery was determined in ics using in vitro microperfusion of ccd after an acute intracellular acid load in wild-type mice and mice of the same strain lacking expression of hkalpha(1), hkalpha(2), or both h-k-atpases (hkalpha(1,2)). a-type and b-type ics were differentiated by luminal loading with bcecf-am and peritubular chloride removal from co(2)/hco(3)-buffered solutions to identify the membrane locations of cl/hco(3) exchange activity. h-atpase- and na/h exchange-mediated h transport were inhibited with bafilomycin a(1) (100 nm) and eipa (10 microm), respectively. here, we report 1) initial ph(i) and buffering capacity were not significantly altered in the ics of hkalpha-deficient mice, 2) either hkalpha(1) or hkalpha(2) deficiency resulted in slower acid extrusion, and 3) a-type ics from hkalpha(1,2)-deficient mice had significantly slower acid extrusion compared with a-type ics from hkalpha(1)-deficient mice alone. these studies are the first nonpharmacological demonstration that both hkalpha(1) and hkalpha(2) contribute to h secretion in both a-type and b-type ics in animals fed a normal diet.
role of caveolae in the pathogenesis of cholesterol-induced gallbladder muscle hypomotility. caveolin is a 22-kda protein that appears to play a critical role in regulating the cholesterol concentration of caveolae. even though caveolin is thought to be a membrane protein, several reports suggest that this peculiar protein can traffic independently of membrane vesicles. we now present evidence that a cytosolic pool of caveolin is part of a heat-shock protein-immunophilin chaperone complex consisting of caveolin, heat-shock protein 56, cyclophilin 40, cyclophilin a, and cholesterol. treatment of nih 3t3 cells with 1 microm cyclosporin a or 100 nm rapamycin disrupted the putative transport complex and prevented rapid (10-20 min) transport of cholesterol to caveolae. the lymphoid cell line, l1210-jf, does not express caveolin, does not form an immunophilin-caveolin complex, and does not transport newly synthesized cholesterol to caveolae. transfection of caveolin cdna into l1210-jf cells allowed the assembly of a transport complex identical to that found in nih 3t3 cells. in addition, newly synthesized cholesterol in transfected cells was rapidly (10-20 min) and specifically transported to caveolae. these data strongly suggest that a caveolin-chaperone complex is a mechanism by which newly synthesized cholesterol is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum through the cytoplasm to caveolae.
tropheryma whippelii dna is rare in the intestinal mucosa of patients without other evidence of whipple disease background & aims the uncultured whipple's disease bacterium (tropheryma whippelii) was characterized in 1991-1992 by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the bacterial 16s ribosomal rna gene. the aim of this study was to develop a pcr assay for diagnostic purposes.   methods modified primers for pcr and a specific probe for hybridization were designed. the specificity of this pcr assay was tested using 37 bacterial control strains and intestinal biopsy samples from 16 patients without whipple's disease. the sensitivity was tested in 88 intestinal biopsy samples from 35 patients with whipple's disease.   results pcr and hybridization were negative in all 37 bacterial controls and in all 16 patients without whipple's disease. before therapy, dna of t. whippelii was detected in all 30 patients with whipple's disease from whom formalin-fixed biopsy material was available, whereas bouin-fixed material was negative. during and after treatment, pcr was negative in 23 of the 24 patients who were followed up. generally, conversion to negative occurred within 1 year. despite negative intestinal pcr, symptomatic cerebral whipple's disease appeared in 3 patients.   conclusions this pcr assay is specific and sensitive and is applicable as a diagnostic test. however, pcr from intestinal biopsy samples seems less helpful for monitoring the effect of treatment.
the crucial role of multiomic approach in cancer research and clinically relevant outcomes most autoimmune diseases are multifactorial diseases and are caused by the immunological reaction against a number of autoantigens. key for understanding autoimmune pathologies is the knowledge of the targeted autoantigens, both initially and during disease progression. we present an approach for autoantigen identification based on isolation of intact autoantibody-antigen complexes from body fluids. after organic precipitation of high molecular weight proteins and free immunoglobulins, released autoantigens were identified by quantitative label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. we confirmed feasibility of target enrichment and identification from highly complex body fluid proteomes by spiking of a predefined antibody-antigen complex at low level of abundance. as a proof of principle, we studied the blinding disease autoimmune uveitis, which is caused by autoreactive t-cells attacking the inner eye and is accompanied by autoantibodies. we identified three novel autoantigens in the spontaneous animal model equine recurrent uveitis (secreted acidic phosphoprotein osteopontin, extracellular matrix protein 1, and metalloproteinase inhibitor 2) and confirmed the presence of the corresponding autoantibodies in 15-25% of patient samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. thus, this workflow led to the identification of novel autoantigens in autoimmune uveitis and may provide a versatile and useful tool to identify autoantigens in other autoimmune diseases in the future.
determinants of ethnic differences in cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, and herpes simplex virus type 1 seroprevalence in childhood. background primary epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection affects the host differently according to when in life it is acquired. understanding risk factors for infection could be important for disease prevention, and the age-specific prevalence of infection must be known to optimize use of a prophylactic vaccine.   methods children 18 months to 19.9 years of age who had blood drawn for medical indications during an outpatient visit were eligible. sera were tested for immunoglobulin g antibodies against ebv viral capsid antigen by enzyme immunoassay. family demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained via scripted telephone questionnaires.   results consent was given for 876 of 914 (96%) subjects approached. sera were available for 782 of 876 (89%) subjects and demographic/socioeconomic data obtained for 705 (90%) of them. antibody prevalence, adjusted for age and sex, was as follows: non-hispanic blacks, 74%; asians, 62%, multiracial children, 54%; hispanics, 50%; and non-hispanic whites, 26%. the pattern of increases in antibody prevalence with age differed significantly by race/ethnicity, and was most divergent in the 2 youngest age groups. adjusted ebv antibody prevalence decreased with greater household education among non-hispanic whites, but was not associated with any other socioeconomic factor. in 42 of 51 (82%) families with >1 child in the study, the siblings' ebv antibody status was concordant (bootstrap p < .001).   conclusions racial/ethnic differences in ebv antibody prevalence and concordance of antibody status among siblings prompt us to speculate that both genetics and family environment contribute to acquisition of ebv infection. the ideal age to give a prophylactic vaccine may differ according to race/ethnicity.
learning pitch with stdp: a computational model of place and temporal pitch perception using spiking neural networks correlated spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neurons can result in strengthening or weakening of synapses, depending on the temporal order of spiking. recent findings indicate that there are narrow and cell type-specific temporal windows for such synaptic modification and that the generally accepted input- (or synapse-) specific rule for modification appears not to be strictly adhered to. spike timing-dependent modifications, together with selective spread of synaptic changes, provide a set of cellular mechanisms that are likely to be important for the development and functioning of neural networks. when an axon of cell a is near enough to excite cell b or repeatedly or consistently takes part in firing it, some growth or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that a's efficiency, as one of the cells firing b, is increased.
roles of hydration, sodium, and chloride in regulation of canine mucociliary transport system. to gain insight into the role of epithelial ion channels, pumps, and cotransporters in regulating airway water and mucociliary transport, we administered inhibitors of the na+ channel (amiloride), 3na-2k-adenosinetriphosphatase (acetylstrophanthidin), and na-k-2cl cotransporter (furosemide) to anesthetized dogs and/or baboons. tracheal ciliary beat frequency was measured by using heterodyne laser light scattering. tracheal mucus velocity (tmv) and bronchial mucociliary clearance (bmc) or lung mucociliary clearance were measured by using radioaerosols and nuclear imaging. respiratory tract fluid output was collected by using a secretion-collecting endotracheal tube. in six dogs, amiloride aerosol -lung deposition, 96 +/- 11 microg (means +/- se)- had minimal effect, whereas acetylstrophanthidin aerosol (lung deposition, 71 +/- 9 microg) increased bmc, and furosemide (40 mg iv) markedly increased tmv. in five baboons, tmv increased after iv furosemide administration (2 mg/kg) as well as by aerosol (lung deposition, 20 +/- 3 mg), coincident with increases in ciliary-mucus coupling from 11.5 +/- 0. 1 to 29.5 +/- 0.4 and 46.5 +/- 0.7 microm/beat, respectively. furosemide also increased lung mucociliary clearance in baboons. in dogs, respiratory tract fluid output increased after intravenous furosemide from 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 6.8 +/- 1.7 mg/min. when combined with dry-air inhalation, furosemide failed to stimulate tmv and reversed the inhibition of bmc by dry air. thus pharmacological manipulation of the na-k-2cl cotransporter and the 3na-2k-adenosinetriphosphatase pump may provide increases of clinical relevance in airway hydration and mucociliary transport.
practical parallel lempel-ziv factorization we present a simple linear work and space, and poly-logarithmic time parallel algorithm for generating multiway cartesian trees. as a special case, the algorithm can be used to generate suffix trees from suffix arrays on arbitrary alphabets in the same bounds. in conjunction with parallel suffix array algorithms, such as the skew algorithm, this gives a rather simple linear work parallel algorithm for generating suffix trees over an integer alphabet σ ⊆ [1,...,n], where n is the length of the input string. more generally, given a sorted sequences of strings and the longest common prefix lengths between adjacent elements, the algorithm will generate a pat tree (compacted trie) over the strings.    we also present experimental results comparing the performance of the algorithm to existing sequential implementations and a second parallel algorithm. we present comparisons for the cartesian tree algorithm on its own and for constructing a suffix tree using our algorithm. the results show that on a variety of strings our algorithm is competitive with the sequential version on a single processor and achieves good speedup on multiple processors.
current prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms in long-term care facilities in the rhine-main district, germany, 2013. since around 2000 - earlier in poland and spain and later in france and the uk - dramatic shifts have occurred in the prevalence and types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in europe. before this watershed, most producers were nosocomial isolates, often klebsiella spp. or enterobacter spp. from specialist care units, and had mutant tem or shv esbls. subsequently, ctx-m esbls have become dominant, with much greater penetration into escherichia coli, and with many infections in 'complicated community' patients, usually with underlying disease, recent antibiotic usage, or healthcare contact. the degree of clonality among producers varies with the country, as does the enzyme type produced, with group 9 (ctx-m-9 and -14) enzymes dominant in spain and group 1 enzymes (particularly ctx-m-3 and -15) dominant elsewhere. irrespective of the particular enzyme, most producers are multiresistant. these changing patterns present major therapeutic and infection control challenges, with the public health intervention points unclear.
uncertainty handling in goal-driven self-optimization - limiting the negative effect on adaptation today's society increasingly depends on software systems deployed in large companies, banks, airports, and so on. these systems must be available 24/7 and continuously adapt to varying environmental conditions and requirements. such dynamically adaptive systems exhibit degrees of variability that depend on user needs and runtime fluctuations in their contexts. the paper presents an approach for specifying and executing dynamically adaptive software systems that combines model-driven and aspect-oriented techniques to help engineers tame the complexity of such systems while offering a high degree of automation and validation.
laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas: a randomized trial on different surgical techniques. part i: clinical results. the management of large endometriomas was described in a series of 814 patients. combined therapy using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (gnrha) and carbon dioxide laser laparoscopy was proposed. drainage and gnrha for 12 weeks provoked a reduction of the endometrioma size up to 50% of the initial value. after vaporization of the internal wall, a cumulative pregnancy of 51% after 1 year was achieved. a recurrence rate of 8% was observed for a follow-up of 2-11 years. histological data demonstrated that the epithelium covering the ovary which is the mesothelium can invaginate in the ovarian cortex. some of the invaginations were seen to be continuous with endometrial tissue, strongly suggesting the metaplasia theory in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma.
information management in the humanities: scholarly processes, tools, and the construction of personal collections technological change is often seen as something that follows its own logic - something we may welcome, or about which we may protest, but which we are unable to alter fundamentally. this reader challenges that assumption and its distinguished contributors demonstrate that technology is affected at a fundamental level by the social context in which it develops. general arguments are introduced about the relation of technology to society and different types of technology are examined: the technology of production; domestic and reproductive technology; and military technology. the book draws on authors from karl marx to cynthia cockburn to show that production technology is shaped by social relations in the workplace. it moves on to the technologies of the household and biological reproduction, which are topics that male-dominated social science has tended to ignore or trivialise - though these are actually of crucial significance where powerful shaping factors are at work, normally unnoticed. the final section asks what shapes the most frightening technology of all - the technology of weaponry, especially nuclear weapons. the editors argue that social scientists have devoted disproportionate attention to the effects of technology on society, and tended to ignore the more fundamental question of what shapes technology in the first place. they have drawn both on established work in the history and sociology of technology and on newer feminist perspectives to show just how important and fruitful it is to try to answer that deeper question. the first edition of this reader, published in 1985, had a considerable influence on thinking about the relationship between technology and society. this second edition has been thoroughly revised and expanded to take into account new research and the emergence of new theoretical perspectives.
the prrx1 homeodomain transcription factor plays a central role in pancreatic regeneration and carcinogenesis. embryonic development of the pancreas is marked by an early phase of dramatic morphogenesis, in which pluripotent progenitor cells of the developing pancreatic epithelium give rise to the full array of mature exocrine and endocrine cell types. the genetic determinants of acinar and islet cell lineages are somewhat well defined; however, the molecular mechanisms directing ductal formation and differentiation remain to be elucidated. the complex ductal architecture of the pancreas is established by a reiterative program of progenitor cell expansion and migration known as branching morphogenesis, or tubulogenesis, which proceeds in mouse development concomitantly with peak pdx1 transcription factor expression. we therefore evaluated pdx1 expression with respect to lineage-specific markers in embryonic sections of the pancreas spanning this critical period of duct formation and discovered an unexpected population of nonislet pdx1-positive cells displaying physical traits of branching. we then established a 3d cell culture model of branching morphogenesis using primary pancreatic duct cells and identified a transient surge of pdx1 expression exclusive to branching cells. from these observations we propose that pdx1 might be involved temporally in a program of gene expression sufficient to facilitate the biochemical and morphological changes necessary for branching morphogenesis.
the fibronectin synergy site re-enforces cell adhesion and mediates a crosstalk between integrin classes fibrin(ogen) deficiency (fg-/-) was shown previously to be compatible with rapid thrombus growth within injured arterioles, but platelet fibronectin content was increased and newly formed thrombi were unstable. to further define the role of fibrin(ogen) in thrombus formation and stabilization, platelet biology was examined in mice expressing a form of fibrinogen that clots normally but lacks the gamma chain c-terminal binding site for alpha iib beta 3 (fg gamma delta 5). thrombus growth within the arterioles of fg gamma delta 5 mice appeared faster than in wild-type mice despite a far greater emboli formation. unlike fg-/- mice, the emboli were relatively small and released from the top of thrombi, rather than by fracture at the vessel wall. the fibronectin content in fg gamma delta 5 platelets was also dramatically increased through a beta 3 integrin-dependent mechanism. the following has been concluded: (1) fibrin formation contributes to, but is not sufficient for, the stabilization of arterial thrombi. platelet receptor engagement of the c-terminal of the fg gamma chain contributes to the stable incorporation of platelets into thrombi. (2) alternative ligands to fibrinogen can support efficient thrombus growth. (3) fibrinogen is internalized through alpha iib beta 3 engagement of the fibrinogen gamma chain element, and this interaction secondarily controls the fibronectin content of platelets.
a parallel multikey quicksort algorithm for mining multiword units after presenting a novel o(n3) parsing algorithm for dependency grammar, we develop three contrasting ways to stochasticize it. we propose (a) a lexical affinity model where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words fluctuate randomly in their selectional preferences, and (c) a generative model where the speaker fleshes out each word's syntactic and conceptual structure without regard to the implications for the hearer. we also give preliminary empirical results from evaluating the three models' parsing performance on annotated wall street journal training text (derived from the penn treebank). in these results, the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equally well at assigning part-of-speech tags.
nutrient enrichment alters dynamics in experimental plant populations detecting the presence of chaos in a dynamical system is an important problem that is solved by measuring the largest lyapunov exponent. lyapunov exponents quantify the exponential divergence of initially close state-space trajectories and estimate the amount of chaos in a system. we present a new method for calculating the largest lyapunov exponent from an experimental time series. the method follows directly from the definition of the largest lyapunov exponent and is accurate because it takes advantage of all the available data. we show that the algorithm is fast, easy to implement, and robust to changes in the following quantities: embedding dimension, size of data set, reconstruction delay, and noise level. furthermore, one may use the algorithm to calculate simultaneously the correlation dimension. thus, one sequence of computations will yield an estimate of both the level of chaos and the system complexity.
accumulation of splice variants and transcripts in response to pi3k inhibition in t cells retinoic acid (ra), a derivative of vitamin a, is essential for the normal patterning and neurogenesis during development. ra treatment induces growth arrest and terminal differentiation of a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (nt2) into postmitotic central nervous system neurons. using rna fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction, we identified a novel serine/threonine-rich protein, ra-regulated nuclearmatrix-associated protein (ramp), that was down-regulated during the ra-induced differentiation of nt2 cells. prominent mrna expression of ramp could be detected in adult placenta and testis as well as in all human fetal tissues examined. the genomic clone of ramp has been mapped to the telomere of chromosome arm 1q, corresponding to band 1q32.1–32.2. associated with the nuclear matrix of nt2 cells, ramp translocates from the interphase nucleus to the metaphase cytoplasm during mitosis. during the late stage of cytokinesis, ramp concentrates at the midzone of the dividing daughter cells. the transcript expression oframp is closely correlated with the cell proliferation rate of nt2 cells. moreover, overexpression of ramp induces a transient increase in the proliferation rate of nt2 cells. taken together, our data suggest that ramp plays a role in the proliferation of the human embryonal carcinoma cells.
functional ecological implications of intraspecific differences in wing melanization in colias butterflies measurina behaviour: an introductory guide. paul martin and patrick bateson, cambridge university, cambridge, 1986, 200 pp. isbn 32368-l price: 620.00 hardback 6.95 paperback. as any science matures, its practioners turn their attention to explicit statements of its formal methodology. within behavioural biology, t.c. schneirla’s 1950 classic “the relationship between observation and experimentation in the field study of behavior” has long been an influential contribution in this regard. more recently, several fairly high-level texts have roamed this terrain. in the present book, martin and bateson have prepared a brief and clear introduction to the principles and methods of quantitative studies of behaviour, directed toward undergraduate and graduate students. within a framework of the steps involved in behavioural research, they begin with a consideration of general issues, research design, and preliminaries: the importance of measurement, niko tinbergen’s programmatic four problems of causation, ontogeny, function, evolution, the choice of species and ievel of analysis, establishing ethograms, the problems of anthropomorphism and observer effects, and experimental designs, with attention to such matters as confounding and correlated observations. there is an approving presentation of the discussion by lee machlis and co-workers of the “pooling fallacy” with respect to repeated observations from a small number of animals. martin and bateson conclude that “repeated measurements from the same subject should be averaged to give a single data point for that subject and the and
adverse reactions to chiropractic treatment and their effects on satisfaction and clinical outcomes among patients enrolled in the ucla neck pain study. study design. a prospective clinic‐based survey. objectives. to study the type, frequency, and characteristics of unpleasant side effects after spinal manipulative therapy. summary of background data. spinal manipulative therapy is a commonly used treatment, but there is little knowledge of its side effects. methods. information regarding unpleasant reactions after spinal manipulative therapy was collected after 4712 treatments on 1058 new patients by 102 norwegian chiropractors (response rate, 70%) through structured interviews. results. at least one reaction was reported by 55% of the patients some time during the course of a maximum of six treatments. of the reported reactions, the most common were local discomfort (53%), headache (12%), tiredness (11%), or radiating discomfort (10%). reactions were mild or moderate in 85% of patients. sixty‐four percent of reactions appeared within 4 hours of treatment, and 74% had disappeared within 24 hours. uncommon reactions were dizziness, nausea, hot skin, or "other" complaints, each accounting for 5% or less of reactions. it was unusual that symptoms commenced later than on the day of or the day after treatment, were of long duration (not gone at the latest on the day after onset), described as severe, or that they resulted in reduced activities of daily living. there were no reports of serious complications in this study. conclusions. profiles now are described of common and uncommon reactions to spinal manipulative therapy and their latency, duration, and severity.
study of water use in agricultural landscapes at high spatiotemporal resulotion we present an operational two-source (soil+vegetation) model for evaluating the surface energy balance given measurements of the time rate of change in radiometric surface temperature (trad) during the morning hours. this model consists of a two-source surface component describing the relation. between trad and sensible heat flux, coupled with a time-integrated component connecting surface sensible heating with planetary boundary layer development. by tying together the time-dependent behavior of surface temperature and the temperature in the boundary layer with the flux of sensible heat from the surface to the atmosphere, the need for ancillary measurements of near-surface air temperature is eliminated. this is a significant benefit when trad is acquired remotely. air temperature can be strongly coupled to local biophysical surface conditions and, if the surface air and brightness temperature measurements used by a model are not collocated, energy flux estimates can be significantly corrupted. furthermore, because this model uses only temporal changes in radiometric temperatures rather than absolute temperatures, time-independent biases in trad, resulting from atmospheric effects or other sources, do not affect the estimated fluxes; only the time-varying component of corrections need be computed. the algorithm also decomposes the surface radiometric temperature into its soil and vegetation. contributions; thus the angular dependence of trad can be predicted from an observation of trad at a single view angle. this capability is critical to an accurate interpretation of off-nadir measurements from polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites. the performance of this model has been evaluated in comparison with data collected during two large-scale field experiments: the first international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment, conducted in and around the konza prairie in kansas, and the monsoon '90 experiment, conducted in the semiarid rangelands of the walnut gulch watershed in southern arizona. both comparisons yielded uncertainties comparable to those achieved by models that do require air temperature as an input and to measurement errors typical of standard micrometeorological methods for flux estimation. a strategy for applying the two-source time-integrated model on a regional or continental scale is briefly outlined.
the evolutionarily dynamic ifn-inducible gtpase proteins play conserved immune functions in vertebrates and cephalochordates. ifn-γ orchestrates a potent antimicrobial host response. however, the underlying molecular basis for this immunological defense system is largely unknown. in a systematic approach to identify ifn-γ-regulated host effector molecules, a notable number of transcripts with consensus gtp-binding motives were obtained. further extensive transcriptome and genome analyses identified five novel family members of murine guanylate-binding proteins (mgbps) now designated mgbp6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. moreover, in this study, all 10 mgbp members (mgbp1–10) were extensively characterized. mgbps are selectively up-regulated in vitro by a set of proinflammatory cytokines and tlr agonists as well as in vivo after listeria monocytogenes and toxoplasma gondii infection. after ifn-γ stimulation, mgbp1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 are associated with intracellular toxoplasma parasites and, interestingly, virulent toxoplasma interfere with mgbp recruitment. taken together, mgbps comprise an important set of host defense molecules.
simultaneous panic and depressive disorders: clinical and sleep eeg correlates four hundred thirty-eight subjects underwent an overnight dexamethasone suppression test (dst) to standardize the test for the diagnosis of melancholia (endogenous depression). abnormal plasma cortisol concentrations within 24 hours after dexamethasone administration occurred almost exclusively in melancholic patients. the best plasma cortisol criterion concentration, above which a dst result may be considered abnormal, was 5 microgram/dl. the optimal dose of dexamethasone was 1 rather than 2 mg. two blood samples obtained at 4 and 11 pm after dexamethasone administration detected 98% of the abnormal test results. this version of the dst identified melancholic patients with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 96%. baseline nocturnal plasma cortisol concentrations were not useful. abnormal dst results were found with similar frequency among outpatients and inpatients with melancholia; but they were not related to age, sex, recent use of psychotropic drugs, or severity of depressive symptoms. extensive evidence validates this practical test for the diagnosis of melancholia.
comparing effects of different cinematic visualization strategies on viewer comprehension a growing number of applications seek to incorporate automatically generated narrative structure into interactive virtual environments. in this paper, we evaluate a representation for narrative structure generated by an automatic planning system by 1) mapping the plans that control plot into conceptual graphs used by quest, an existing framework for question-answering analysis that includes structures for modeling a reader's narrative comprehension and 2) using methods originally employed by quest's developers to determine if the plan structures can serve as effective models of the understanding that human users form after viewing corresponding stories played out within a virtual world. results from our analysis are encouraging, though additional work is required to expand the plan language to cover a broader class of narrative structure.

mathematical model of a gene regulatory network reconciles effects of genetic perturbations on hematopoietic stem cell emergence. conservation of the vertebrate body plan has been attributed to the evolutionary stability of gene-regulatory networks (grns). we describe a regulatory circuit made up of gata2, fli1, and scl/tal1 and their enhancers, gata2-3, fli1+12, and scl+19, that operates during specification of hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo. we show that the fli1+12 enhancer, like the gata2-3 and scl+19 enhancers, targets hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and relies on a combination of ets, gata, and e-box motifs. we show that the gata2-3 enhancer also uses a similar cluster of motifs and that gata2, fli1, and scl are expressed in embryonic day-11.5 dorsal aorta where hscs originate and in fetal liver where they multiply. the three hsc enhancers in these tissues and in es cell-derived hemangioblast equivalents are bound by each of these transcription factors (tfs) and form a fully connected triad that constitutes a previously undescribed example of both this network motif in mammalian development and a grn kernel operating during the specification of a mammalian stem cell.
assuming the worst may not be bad at all carvedilol in heart failure treatment this paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. these reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. we discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. this approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. the model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. we suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.
merging knowledge bases in different languages in the original pagerank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results, a single pagerank vector is computed, using the link structure of the web, to capture the relative "importance" of web pages, independent of any particular search query. to yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of pagerank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. by using these (precomputed) biased pagerank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic pagerank vector. for ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive pagerank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. for searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a web page), we compute the topic-sensitive pagerank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared.
single-lead f-wave extraction using diffusion geometry. objectives atrial fibrillation (af) in man has previously been shown to include a wide variety of atrial activity. assessment of the characteristics of this arrhythmia with a commonly applicable tool may therefore be important in the choice and evaluation of different therapeutic strategies. as the af cycle length has been shown to correlate locally with atrial refractoriness and globally with the degree of atrial organization, with, in general, shorter cycle length during apparently random af compared to more organized af, we have developed a new method for non-invasive assessment of the af cycle length using the surface and the esophagus (eso) ecg.   methods and results from the frequency spectrum of the residual ecg, created by suppression of the qrst complexes, the dominant atrial cycle length (dacl) was derived. by comparison with multiple intracardiac simultaneously acquired right and left af cycle lengths in patients with paroxysmal af, we found that the dacl in lead v1, ranging from 130 to 185 ms, well represented a spatial average of the right af cycle lengths, whereas the dacl in the eso ecg, ranging from 140 to 185 ms, reflected both the right and the left af cycle length, where the influence from each structure depended on the atrial anatomy of the individual, as determined by mri. in patients with chronic af, the method was capable of following changes in the af cycle length due to administration of d,l-sotalol and 5 min of ecg recording was sufficient for the dacl to be reproducible.   conclusions we conclude that this new non-invasive method, named 'frequency analysis of fibrillatory ecg' (faf-ecg), is capable of assessing both the magnitude and the dynamics of the atrial fibrillation cycle length in man.
electroencephalographic characteristics of cognitive-specific alerting attention in verbal learning: iii. localized characteristics of eeg spatial synchronization electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 subjects (students) in states of: rest with the eyes open; memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (latin and russian); and recollection (control) of the memorized information. estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared using statistical methods for the frequency bands θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ. the results of this comparison showed that transition from the state of rest to those of memorization and recollection was accompanied by numerous changes in coherence in all the frequency bands. these changes varied in intensity and embrace practically the entire convexital cerebral cortex. decrease in eeg coherence was predominant during the transition to the memorization state in various frequency bands, whereas during the transition from the rest state to that of recollection, eeg coherence increased in most of the frequency bands except for the band α2. the reproducibility of this pattern of changes in eeg coherence is confirmed by the results in the subgroups formed by randomly subdividing the subjects into two groups. we think that the observed intense rearrangement of the spatial synchronization of the cortex electrical activity reflects the reorganization of the functional systems of neuronal ensembles to provide efficient memorization and recollection, respectively.
the role of the striatum in adaptation learning: a computational model visuomotor adaptation to a kinematic distortion was investigated in parkinson's disease (pd) patients and age-matched controls. participants performed pointing movements in which the visual feedback of hand movement, displayed as a screen cursor, was normal (pre-exposure condition) or rotated by 90° counterclockwise (exposure condition). aftereffects were assessed in a post-exposure condition in which the visual feedback of hand movement was set back to normal. in pre- and early-exposure trials, both groups showed similar initial directional error (ide) and movement straightness (rmse, root mean square error), but the pd group showed reduced movement smoothness (normalized jerk, nj) and primary submovement to total movement distance ratios (ptr). during late-exposure the pd subjects, compared with controls, showed larger ide, rmse, nj, and smaller ptr scores. moreover, pd patients showed smaller aftereffects than the controls during the post-exposure condition. overall, the pd group showed both slower and reduced adaptation compared with the control group. these results are discussed in terms of reduced signal-to-noise ratio in feedback signals related to increased movement variability and/or disordered kinesthesia, deficits in movement initiation, impaired selection of initial movement direction, and deficits in internal model formation in pd patients. we conclude that parkinson's disease impairs visuomotor adaptation.
simultaneous quantification of ramipril , glimepiride and metformin in human plasma by ultra-performance liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of ramipril, ramiprilat and telmisartan in human plasma. the solid-phase extraction technique was used for the extraction of ramipril, ramiprilat and telmisartan from human plasma. trandolaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide were used as the internal standards (iss). chromatography was performed on a hypurity c18, 5 μm, 50 mm × 4.6mm column, with the mobile phase consisting of ammonium acetate and acetonitrile (in a 20:80 ratio), followed by detection using mass spectrometry. the method involves a simple reversed isocratic chromatography condition and mass spectrometry detection, which enables detection at sub-nanogram levels. the method was validated and the lower limit of quantification for ramipril, ramiprilat and telmisartan was found to be 0.1 ng ml(-1), 0.1 ng ml(-1) and 2 ng ml(-1), respectively. the mean recovery for ramipril, ramiprilat and telmisartan ranged from 90.1 to 104.1%. this method increased the sensitivity and selectivity; resulting in high-throughput analysis of ramipril, ramiprilat and telmisartan using two different iss in a single experiment for bioequivalence studies, with a chromatographic run time of 1.5 min only.
arabidopsis synaptotagmin 2 participates in pollen germination and tube growth and is delivered to plasma membrane via conventional secretion. synaptotagmin 1 probably functions as a ca2+ sensor in neurotransmitter release via its two c2-domains, but no common ca2+-dependent activity that could underlie a cooperative action between them has been described. the nmr structure of the c2b-domain now reveals a beta sandwich that exhibits striking similarities and differences with the c2a-domain. whereas the bottom face of the c2b-domain has two additional alpha helices that may be involved in specialized ca2+-independent functions, the top face binds two ca2+ ions and is remarkably similar to the c2a-domain. consistent with these results, but in contrast to previous studies, we find that the c2b-domain binds phospholipids in a ca2+-dependent manner similarly to the c2a-domain. these results suggest a novel view of synaptotagmin function whereby the two c2-domains cooperate in a common activity, ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, to trigger neurotransmitter release.
extrinsic channel-like fingerprinting overlays using subspace embedding the use of multi-amplitude signaling schemes in wireless ofdm systems requires the tracking of the fading radio channel. the paper addresses channel estimation based on time-domain channel statistics. using a general model for a slowly fading channel, the authors present the mmse and ls estimators and a method for modifications compromising between complexity and performance. the symbol error rate for a 18-qam system is presented by means of simulation results. depending upon estimator complexity, up to 4 db in snr can be gained over the ls estimator.
profiling neuroendocrine gene expression changes following fadrozole-induced estrogen decline in the female goldfish. goldfish (carassius auratus) are excellent model organisms for the neuroendocrine signaling and the regulation of reproduction in vertebrates. goldfish also serve as useful model organisms in numerous other fields. in contrast to mammals, teleost fish do not have a median eminence; the anterior pituitary is innervated by numerous neuronal cell types and thus, pituitary hormone release is directly regulated. here we briefly describe the neuroendocrine control of luteinizing hormone. stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone and a multitude of classical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is opposed by the potent inhibitory actions of dopamine. the stimulatory actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin are also discussed. we will focus on the development of a cdna microarray composed of carp and goldfish sequences which has allowed us to examine neurotransmitter-regulated gene expression in the neuroendocrine brain and to investigate potential genomic interactions between these key neurotransmitter systems. we observed that isotocin (fish homologue of oxytocin) and activins are regulated by multiple neurotransmitters, which is discussed in light of their roles in reproduction in other species. we have also found that many novel and uncharacterized goldfish expressed sequence tags in the brain are also regulated by neurotransmitters. their sites of production and whether they play a role in neuroendocrine signaling and control of reproduction remain to be determined. the transcriptomic tools developed to study reproduction could also be used to advance our understanding of neuroendocrine-immune interactions and the relationship between growth and food intake in fish.
mitochondrial phylogeography of the bedriaga's rock lizard, archaeolacerta bedriagae (reptilia: lacertidae) endemic to corsica and sardinia. pleistocene climatic oscillations were a major force shaping genetic variability in many taxa. we analyse the relative effects of the ice ages across a latitudinal gradient in the western mediterranean region, testing two main predictions: (i) species with historical distributions in northern latitudes should have experienced greater loss of suitable habitat, resulting in higher extinction of historical lineages than species distributed in southern latitudes, where the effects of the ice ages were not as drastic. this would be reflected in the observation of lower diversity and number of differentiated lineages in northern areas. (ii) a signature of demographic expansion following the climate amelioration should be obvious in northern species, whereas in the south evidence of long‐term effective population size stability should be observed. we used as models three species of wall lizards (podarcis bocagei, podarcis carbonelli and podarcis vaucheri) that replace each other along the study area. we investigated the patterns of mitochondrial dna diversity and subdivision and obtained demographic parameter estimates for each species. our results suggest that p. bocagei, the northernmost species, bears low genetic diversity, a shallow coalescent history and marks of a demographic expansion. in contrast, p. vaucheri, the species with a southernmost distribution, shows deeper coalescence events, complex geographical substructure and no evidence for population growth. the species with an intermediate distribution, p. carbonelli, shows average levels of diversity, substructure and population growth. taken together, these results conform to our main predictions and are explained by a differential influence of the ice ages on distinct latitudes.
novel role of mecp2 in developing oligodendrocytes and myelination an epigenetic program regulated by mecp2 needs to be maintained throughout life for normal neurological function. rett syndrome (rtt) is a postnatal neurological disorder caused by mutations in mecp2, encoding the epigenetic regulator methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2). the onset of rtt symptoms during early life together with findings suggesting neurodevelopmental abnormalities in rtt and mouse models of rtt raised the question of whether maintaining mecp2 function exclusively during early life might protect against disease. we show by using an inducible model of rtt that deletion of mecp2 in adult mice recapitulates the germline knock-out phenotype, underscoring the ongoing role of mecp2 in adult neurological function. moreover, unlike the effects of other epigenetic instructions programmed during early life, the effects of early mecp2 function are lost soon after its deletion. these findings suggest that therapies for rtt must be maintained throughout life.
give me a sign: decoding four complex hand gestures based on high-density ecog brain surface electrocorticographic (ecog) recordings can investigate human brain electrophysiology at the cortical surface with exceptionally high signal to noise ratio and spatio-temporal resolution. to be able to use the high spatial resolution of ecog for accurate brain function mapping and neurophysiology studies, the exact location of the ecog electrodes on the brain surface should be known. several issues complicate robust localization: surgical photographs of the electrode array made after implantation are often incomplete because the grids may be moved underneath the skull, beyond the exposed area. computed tomography (ct) scans made after implantation will clearly localize electrodes, but the effects of surgical intervention may cause the exposed brain to move away from the skull and assume an unpredictable shape (the so-called brain shift). first, we present a method based on a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (mri) coregistered with a post-implantation ct scan to localize the electrodes and that automatically corrects for the brain shift by projecting the electrodes to the surface of the cortex. the calculated electrode positions are visualized on the individual subjects brain surface rendering. second, the method was validated by comparison with surgical photographs, finding a median difference between photographic and calculated electrode centers-of-mass of only 2.6mm, across 6 subjects. third, to illustrate its utility we demonstrate how functional mri and ecog findings in the same subject may be directly compared in a simple motor movement experiment even when electrodes are not visible in the craniotomy.
incorporating reliable virtual ratings into social recommendation systems recommender systems provide users with personalized suggestions for products or services. these systems often rely on collaborating filtering (cf), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. the two more successful approaches to cf are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. in this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. the factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. the methods are tested on the netflix data. results are better than those previously published on that dataset. in addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-k recommendation task.

bilingual word embeddings from non-parallel document-aligned data applied to bilingual lexicon induction we present a new language pair agnostic approach to inducing bilingual vector spaces from non-parallel data without any other resource in a bootstrapping fashion. the paper systematically introduces and describes all key elements of the bootstrapping procedure: (1) starting point or seed lexicon, (2) the confidence estimation and selection of new dimensions of the space, and (3) convergence. we test the quality of the induced bilingual vector spaces, and analyze the influence of the different components of the bootstrapping approach in the task of bilingual lexicon extraction (ble) for two language pairs. results reveal that, contrary to conclusions from prior work, the seeding of the bootstrapping process has a heavy impact on the quality of the learned lexicons. we also show that our approach outperforms the best performing fully corpus-based ble methods on these test sets.
left atrial appendage closure guided by integrated echocardiography and fluoroscopy imaging reduces radiation exposure background the aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and accuracy of a new real-time 3-dimensional (rt3d) matrix-array transesophageal echocardiographic probe for the determination of left atrial appendage (laa) geometry.   methods sixty-six consecutive patients (mean age, 53 +/- 17 years) referred for 2-dimensional (2d) transesophageal echocardiography (tee) underwent additional rt3d tee. the feasibility of rt3d tee for laa geometry was studied in the first 37 patients, and 2d and rt3d transesophageal echocardiographic quantification of the laa were compared in the subsequent 29 patients. the laa orifice diameter and depth were measured using biplane 2d tee, and laa orifice area was calculated as an ellipse. laa orifice area and depth were measured in 3d and correlated to 2d measurement and were also correlated to 64-slice cardiac computed tomography (ct) in 8 patients.   results all 66 patients underwent rt3d matrix-array tee without complication. in the feasibility study, the laa was well visualized in 95%. in the quantitation study, 2d tee underestimated laa orifice area compared with 3d imaging (3.1 +/- 1.3 vs 4.2 +/- 2.2 cm(2); r = 0.55). laa depth by 2d and 3d imaging were well correlated (3.7 +/- 0.7 vs 3.4 +/- 0.7 cm; r = 0.77). laa orifice area on ct was well correlated with area on 3d tee (r = 0.98) but not with area 2d tee (r = 0.13). bland-altman analysis demonstrated that 2d tee systematically underestimated laa orifice area compared with 3d tee (mean bias, -1.0 cm(2), with wide limits of agreement [-4.6 to 2.6 cm(2)]). in the 8 patients who underwent both 3d tee and ct, the mean bias was 0.15 cm(2), with narrow limits of agreement (-0.50 to 0.20 cm(2)).   conclusions rt3d tee for the visualization and quantitative analysis of laa orifice area is feasible and correlates well with 64-slice cardiac ct.
supraclavicular decompression for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome in adolescent and adult populations. objective the present study was undertaken to determine which factors differentiate patients with a good outcome after treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome (tos) from patients with a poor outcome.   methods a total of 85 patients, who were examined during one year, had at least 6 months of follow up after treatment for tos with either surgery or botulinum chemodenervation.   results socioeconomic factors of work disability or workers' compensation claims did not differentiate treatment-responsive tos from treatment-resistant cases. there was no difference between the 2 groups regarding the presence of anomalous anatomy detected by ultrasonography or regarding the presence of subclavian artery flow acceleration or occlusion detected by duplex sonography. several factors were noted more frequently in treatment-resistant patients: sensory complaints extending beyond lower trunk dermatomes (42% vs. 10%), weakness extending beyond lower trunk myotomes (19% vs. 2%), histories of previous non-tos surgery of the neck or upper limbs (50% vs.17%), comorbidities of fibromyalgia or complex regional pain syndrome (81% vs. 12%), and depression (35% vs. 10%). treatment-resistant patients complained about more widespread functional impairments on a validated cervical brachial symptom questionnaire (cbsq) than treatment-responsive patients. resistant cases responded less often to a scalene test block (38% vs. 100%), which is designed to simulate the effects of targeted treatment.   conclusion in summary, compared to patients with a good outcome after targeted treatment, patients with a poor outcome had more diffuse complaints and responded less often to a scalene test block.
association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) polymorphisms with genetic susceptibility to gastric cancer: a meta-analysis background advances in human genetics could help us to assess prognosis on an individual basis and to optimise the management of complex diseases. however, different studies on the same genetic association sometimes have discrepant results. our aim was to assess how often large studies arrive at different conclusions than smaller studies, and whether this situation arises more frequently when findings of first published studies disagree with those of subsequent research.   methods we examined the results of 55 meta-analyses (579 study comparisons) of genetic associations and tested whether the magnitude of the genetic effect differs in large versus smaller studies.   findings we noted significant between-study heterogeneity in 26 (47%) meta-analyses. the magnitude of the genetic effect differed significantly in large versus smaller studies in ten (18%), 20 (36%), and 21 (38%) meta-analyses with tests of rank correlation, regression on se, and regression on inverse of variance, respectively. the largest studies generally yielded more conservative results than the complete meta-analyses, which included all studies (p=0.005). in 14 (26%) meta-analyses the proposed association was significantly stronger in the first studies than in subsequent research. only in nine (16%) meta-analyses was the genetic association significant and replicated without hints of heterogeneity or bias. there was little concordance in first versus subsequent discrepancies, and large versus small discrepancies.   interpretation genuine heterogeneity and bias could affect the results of genetic association studies. genetic risk factors for complex diseases should be assessed cautiously and, if possible, using large scale evidence.
transcriptional wiring of cell wall-related genes in arabidopsis. a new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (blast), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (msp) score. recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of msp scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. the basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward dna and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long dna sequences. in addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, blast is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.
continuous monitoring in the dynamic sensor field model we introduce a formal model of computation for networks of tiny artifacts, the static synchronous sensor field model (sssf) which considers that the devices communicate through a fixed communication graph and interact with the environment through input/output data streams. we analyze the performance of sssfs solving two sensing problems the average monitoring and the alerting problems. for constant memory sssfs we show that the set of recognized languages is contained in dspace(n + m) where n is the number of nodes of the communication graph and m its number of edges. finally we explore the capabilities of sssfs having sensing and additional non-sensing constant memory devices.
deer herbivory affects the functional diversity of forest floor plants via changes in competition-mediated assembly rules plant functional traits are the features (morphological, physiological, phenological) that represent ecological strategies and determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and influence ecosystem properties. variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardised ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. this line of research has been among the most fruitful avenues for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes. it also has the potential both to build a predictive set of local, regional and global relationships between plants and environment and to quantify a wide range of natural and human-driven processes, including changes in biodiversity, the impacts of species invasions, alterations in biogeochemical processes and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. the importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardised protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily. updated and expanded from the widely used previous version, this handbook retains the focus on clearly presented, widely applicable, step-by-step recipes, with a minimum of text on theory, and not only includes updated methods for the traits previously covered, but also introduces many new protocols for further traits. this new handbook has a better balance between whole-plant traits, leaf traits, root and stem traits and regenerative traits, and puts particular emphasis on traits important for predicting species’ effects on key ecosystem properties. we hope this new handbook becomes a standard companion in local and global efforts to learn about the responses and impacts of different plant species with respect to environmental changes in the present, past and future.
transesophageal echocardiography, insufficient cleaning practices and lax equipment maintenance, and escherichia coli - a breakdown in infection control objectives. to describe the epidemiology of nosocomial infections in pediatric intensive care units (icus) in the united states. background. patient and icu characteristics in pediatric icus suggest the pattern of nosocomial infections experienced may differ from that seen in adult icus. methods. data were collected between january 1992 and december 1997 from 61 pediatric icus in the united states using the standard surveillance protocols and nosocomial infection site definitions of the national nosocomial infections surveillance system's icu surveillance component. results. data on 110 709 patients with 6290 nosocomial infections were analyzed. primary bloodstream infections (28%), pneumonia (21%), and urinary tract infections (15%) were most frequent and were almost always associated with use of an invasive device. primary bloodstream infections and surgical site infections were reported more frequently in infants aged 2 months or less as compared with older children. urinary tract infections were reported more frequently in children >5 years old compared with younger children. coagulase-negative staphylococci (38%) were the most common bloodstream isolates, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli were reported in 25% of primary bloodstream infections. pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%) was the most common species reported from pneumonia and escherichia coli (19%), from urinary tract infections. enterobacter spp. were isolated with increasing frequency from pneumonia and were the most common gram-negative isolates from bloodstream infections. device-associated infection rates for bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections did not correlate with length of stay, the number of hospital beds, or season. conclusions. in pediatric icus, bloodstream infections were the most common nosocomial infection. the distribution of infection sites and pathogens differed with age and from that reported from adult icus. device-associated infection rates were the best rates currently available for comparisons between units, because they were not associated with length of stay, the number of beds in the hospital, or season.
on the design of scalable and reusable accelerators for big data applications these days, many traditional end-user applications are said to “run fast enough” on existing machines, so the search continues for novel applications that can leverage the new capabilities of our evolving hardware. foremost of these potential applications are those that are clustered around information processing capabilities that humans have today but are lacking in computers. the fact that brains can perform these computations serves as an existence proof that these applications are realizable. at the same time, we often discover that the human nervous system, with its 80 billion neurons, on some metrics, is more powerful and energy-efficient than today's machines. both of these aspects make this class of applications a desirable target for an architectural benchmark suite, because there is evidence that these applications are both useful and computationally challenging. this paper details cortexsuite, a synthetic brain benchmark suite, which seeks to capture this workload. we classify and identify benchmarks within cortexsuite by analogy to the human neural processing function. we use the major lobes of the cerebral cortex as a model for the organization and classification of data processing algorithms. to be clear, our goal is not to emulate the brain at the level of the neuron, but rather to collect together synthetic, man-made algorithms that have similar function and have met with success in the real world. we consulted six world-class machine learning and computer vision researchers, who collectively hold 83,091 citations across their distinct subareas, asking them to identify newly emerging computationally-intensive algorithms or applications that are going to have a large impact over the next ten years. this is coupled with datasets that reflect the philosophy of practical use algorithms and are coded in “clean c” so as to make them accessible, analyzable, and usable for parallel and approximate compiler and architecture researchers alike.
comparison between supervised and unsupervised learning of probabilistic linear discriminant analysis mixture models for speaker verification many current face recognition algorithms perform badly when the lighting or pose of the probe and gallery images differ. in this paper we present a novel algorithm designed for these conditions. we describe face data as resulting from a generative model which incorporates both within-individual and between-individual variation. in recognition we calculate the likelihood that the differences between face images are entirely due to within-individual variability. we extend this to the non-linear case where an arbitrary face manifold can be described and noise is position-dependent. we also develop a "tied" version of the algorithm that allows explicit comparison across quite different viewing conditions. we demonstrate that our model produces state of the art results for (i) frontal face recognition (ii) face recognition under varying pose.
comparison of left atrial function in healthy individuals versus patients with non-st-segment elevation myocardial infarction using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography objectives recently, a novel method to measure strain from standard two-dimensional images has been developed. our goal was to characterize global and regional systolic function abnormalities using this technique in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm).   background strain has been proposed as a sensitive tool to detect early systolic function abnormalities in hcm. however, the clinical application of conventional doppler-derived strain has been limited by poor reproducibility and angle dependency.   methods echocardiographic examinations were performed in 26 patients with nonobstructive hcm and 45 healthy subjects. using a dedicated software package, bidimensional acquisitions were analyzed to measure longitudinal and transverse strain in apical views and circumferential and radial strain in parasternal short-axis view.   results despite apparently normal left ventricular systolic function, all components of strain were significantly reduced in hcm. average longitudinal, transverse, circumferential, and radial strain in patients with hcm and controls were -15.1 +/- 6.2% versus -20.3 +/- 5.6%, 23.3 +/- 17.0% versus 27.2 +/- 14.9%, -16.8 +/- 7.1% versus 19.6 +/- 5.2%, and 25.2 +/- 13.9% versus 36.8 +/- 17.2%, respectively (all p < 0.001). in patients with asymmetrical hcm, longitudinal septal strain was significantly lower than for other left ventricular segments combined: -9.2 +/- 4.7% versus -12.7 +/- 7.1% (p = 0.001). average interobserver and intraobserver variabilities were 11% and 11.3%, respectively.   conclusions two-dimensional strain is a new simple, rapid, and reproducible method to measure different components of systolic strain. this technique identified early abnormalities in patients with hcm that have apparently normal left ventricular systolic function.
disclosing pathogenic genetic variants to research participants: quantifying an emerging ethical responsibility. reading the recent editorial in the journal by richard cotton, which publicised the proposed new human variome project, one could be forgiven for thinking that no central repository for inherited human gene mutations of pathological significance currently exists. in practice, however, the human gene mutation database (hgmd; http://www.hgmd.org) already constitutes a comprehensive collection of single base-pair substitutions in coding (missense and nonsense), regulatory and splicing-relevant regions of human nuclear genes, micro-deletions and microinsertions, indels, repeat expansions, as well as gross gene lesions (deletions, insertions and duplications) and complex gene rearrangements. this unique resource currently contains in excess of 96,000 different germline mutations and disease-associated/ functional polymorphisms—in a total of over 3,600 nuclear genes (december 2009 release)—causing or associated with human inherited disease. hgmd currently provides free access to the bulk of its mutation data to over 30,000 registered academic/non-profit users worldwide. in the absence of any public funding, hgmd is maintained courtesy of a subscription-based version (hgmd professional), distributed through biobase gmbh (http://www.biobase-international.com). hgmd professional not only provides access to the very latest mutation data, but also contains valuable extra features, including an expanded search engine, genomic coordinates, additional literature references, human genome variation society (hgvs) nomenclature (http://www.hgvs. org/mutnomen) and a suite of advanced search tools that greatly enhance the utility of the database. together with biobase, we are working toward being able to make all hgmd data and search tools available to the academic community free of charge and in a timely fashion, with the costs of upkeep being borne primarily by industry and commerce. we believe that this funding model should not only guarantee the financial viability of hgmd, but also allow this unique resource to be sustainable into the long term, to the benefit of the scientific community. although hgmd has now become the de facto central disease-associated mutation database, there are several other valuable sources of human mutation data available. online mendelian inheritance in man (omim; http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim) is a formidable genotype–phenotype knowledge base, but it is not comprehensive with respect to mutation data on account of its policy of providing only specimen examples of allelic variants (in a total of 2,328 human genes). in addition to inherited pathological mutations, it should be noted that omim also contains some somatic lesions, neutral guest editorial
fasting ghrelin levels are decreased in obese subjects and are significantly related with insulin resistance and body mass index background  ghrelin is a potent gh secretagogue that also plays an important role in appetite and weight regulation. ghrelin increases hunger and food intake, and its levels decrease after a standard meal or glucose.
embedded effort indicators on the california verbal learning test – second edition (cvlt–ii): an attempted cross-validation this study determined whether performance patterns on the california verbal learning test-ii (cvlt-ii) could differentiate participants with traumatic brain injury (tbi) showing adequate effort from those with mild tbi exhibiting poor effort using a case-control design. the tbi group consisted of 124 persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). the poor effort group consisted of 77 persons with mild head injury who were involved in litigation (lg) and failed at least one stand-alone symptom validity measure (svt) and also either a second svt or an effort indicator embedded within a standard clinical test. a total of 18 cvlt-ii variables were investigated using bayesian model averaging (bma) for logistic regression to determine which variables best differentiated the groups. the cvlt-ii variables having the most support were long-delay free recall, total recognition discriminability (d′), and total recall discriminability.
when does frustration not reduce continuance intention of online gamers? the expectancy disconfirmation perspective abstract this paper examines key drivers of consumers' intention to continue using business-to-consumer e-commerce services. multiple theoretical perspectives are synthesized to hypothesize a model of continuance behavior, which is then empirically tested using a field survey of online brokerage (olb) users. salient results include: (1) consumers' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with initial service use, their perceived usefulness of service use, and the interaction between perceived usefulness and loyalty incentives for service use, and (2) satisfaction and perceived usefulness are both predicted by consumers' confirmation of expectations from initial service use. implications of these findings for e-commerce firms contemplating customer relationship management (crm) initiatives are discussed.
tnf-α inhibits liver collagen-α1(i) gene expression through a tissue-specific regulatory region. the mechanisms responsible for impaired wound healing in patients with cachexia-associated infection, inflammation, and cancer are unknown. as tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha is elevated in these diseases, and tnf-alpha inhibits collagen alpha1(i) gene expression in cultured fibroblasts, we analyzed whether chronically elevated serum tnf-alpha affects collagen metabolism in vivo by inoculating nude mice with chinese hamster ovary cells secreting tnf-alpha (tnf-alpha mice) or control chinese hamster ovary cells (control mice). before the onset of weight loss, tnf-alpha mice had a selective decrease in collagen synthesis and collagen alpha1(i) mrna in the skin. in addition, tnf-alpha mice displayed impaired healing of incisional and excisional skin wounds, compared with control animals, before the onset of cachexia. the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1, a potent fibrogenic factor, was inhibited by tnf-alpha in the skin. in studies with transgenic mice expressing the human growth hormone under the direction of 5' regulatory regions of the human collagen alpha1(i) gene, tnf-alpha treatment inhibited the expression of the collagen alpha1(i) human growth hormone transgene containing -2.3 kb of the 5' region, whereas transgene expression directed by -0.44 kb of the 5' region was not affected. these experiments suggest that tnf-alpha may play an important role in the impaired wound healing of chronic diseases that are characterized by a high production of this cytokine and provide insights for potential therapeutic approaches.
transposon tagging of the defective embryo and meristems gene of tomato we are developing a system for isolating tomato genes by transposon mutagenesis. in maize and tobacco, the transposon activator (ac) transposes preferentially to genetically linked sites. to identify transposons linked to various target genes, we have determined the rflp map locations of ac- and dissociation (ds)-carrying t-dnas in a number of transformants. t-dna flanking sequences were isolated using the inverse polymerase chain reaction (ipcr) and located on the rflp map of tomato. the authenticity of ipcr reaction products was tested by several criteria including nested primer amplification, dna sequence analysis and pcr amplification of the corresponding insertion target sequences. we report the rflp map locations of 37 transposon-carrying t-dnas. we also report the map locations of nine transposed ds elements. t-dnas were identified on all chromosomes except chromosome 6. our data revealed no apparent chromosomal preference for t-dna integration events. lines carrying transposons at known map locations have been established which should prove a useful resource for isolating tomato genes by transposon mutagenesis.
measurement of wood stiffness in standing trees and logs : implications for end-product quality abstract the practical implications and benefits of using acoustics for sorting pine logs at the skids is reported. the aim is to segregate logs according to their intrinsic stiffnesses and to determine the proportion of lumber making framing or structural grades. the proposition is that there are significant financial benefits to sawmillers if the poorest logs – those which yield low stiffness timber – can be identified and diverted to other end uses that do not require high stiffness.
maternal allocation strategies and differential effects of yolk carotenoids on the phenotype and viability of yellow‐legged gull (larus michahellis) chicks in relation to sex and laying order maternal effects mediated by egg quality are important sources of offspring phenotypic variation and can influence the course of evolutionary processes. mothers allocate to the eggs diverse antioxidants that protect the embryo from oxidative stress. in the yellow‐legged gull (larus michahellis), yolk antioxidant capacity varied markedly among clutches and declined considerably with egg laying date. analysis of bioptic yolk samples from clutches that were subsequently partially cross‐fostered revealed a positive effect of yolk antioxidant capacity on embryonic development and chick growth, but not on immunity and begging behaviour, while controlling for parentage and common environment effects. chick plasma antioxidant capacity varied according to rearing environment, after statistically partitioning out maternal influences mediated by egg quality. thus, the results of this study indicate that egg antioxidants are important mediators of maternal effects also in wild bird populations, especially during the critical early post‐hatching phase.
does thiazolidinedione therapy exacerbate fluid retention in congestive heart failure? objective: to evaluate the effects of intensive insulin therapy alone or with added pioglitazone on renal salt/water balance and body fluid compartment shifts in type 2 diabetes.
expression of the potential therapeutic target cxxc5 in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells - high expression is associated with adverse prognosis as well as altered intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation acute myeloid leukemia (aml) frequently comprises mutations in genes that cause perturbation in intracellular signaling pathways, thereby altering normal responses to growth factors and cytokines. such oncogenic cellular signal transduction may be therapeutic if targeted directly or through epigenetic regulation. we treated 24 selected elderly aml patients with all-trans retinoic acid for 2 days before adding theophylline and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (clinicaltrials.gov nct00175812; eudract no. 2004-001663-22), and sampled 11 patients for peripheral blood at day 0, 2 and 7 for single-cell analysis of basal level and signal-transduction responses to relevant myeloid growth factors (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, flt3l, stem cell factor, erythropoietin, cxcl-12) on 10 signaling molecules (creb, stat1/3/5, p38, erk1/2, akt, c-cbl, zap70/syk and rps6). pretreatment analysis by unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis divided the patients into three distinguishable signaling clusters (non-potentiated, potentiated basal and potentiated signaling). signal-transduction pathways were modulated during therapy and patients moved between the clusters. patients with multiple leukemic clones demonstrated distinct stimulation responses and therapy-induced modulation. individual signaling profiles together with clinical and hematological information may be used to early identify aml patients in whom epigenetic and signal-transduction targeted therapy is beneficial.
aging and movement errors when lifting and lowering light loads the purpose of the study was to determine the practice-induced adjustments in the motor-output variability and the agonist-antagonist activity that accompanied improvements in endpoint accuracy of goal-directed isometric contractions in young and old adults. young and old adults performed 100 trials that involved accurately matching the peak of a force trajectory (25% maximum) to a target force in 150 ms. endpoint accuracy was quantified as the absolute difference between the target and the peak force and time-to-peak force. motor-output variability was expressed as the sds of the force trajectory, peak force, and time-to-peak force. the force and time errors differed between the two groups initially, but after 35 practice trials the errors were similar for the two groups. reductions in force endpoint error were predicted by decreases in the variability of the force trajectory for both groups, adaptations in the agonist (first dorsal interosseus) and antagonist (second palmar interosseus) emg for young adults, and adaptations only for the agonist emg for old adults. reductions in time endpoint error were predicted by increases in the sd of time-to-peak force and a longer delay to the peak emg of the antagonist muscle for young adults, but by decreases in the sds of time-to-peak force and force trajectory and a shorter delay to the peak emg of the antagonist muscle for the old adults. the findings indicate that the neural adjustments underlying the improvement in endpoint accuracy with practice differed for young and old adults.
a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
application of photoluminescent measurement techniques for quantitative assessment of turbine film cooling structural features resulting from the interaction of a turbulent jet issuing transversely into a uniform stream are described with the help of flow visualization and hot-wire anemometry. jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios from 2 to 10 were investigated at crossflow reynolds numbers from 3800 to 11400. in particular, the origin and formation of the vortices in the wake are described and shown to be fundamentally different from the well-known phenomenon of vortex shedding from solid bluff bodies. the flow around a transverse jet does not separate from the jet and does not shed vorticity into the wake. instead, the wake vortices have their origins in the laminar boundary layer of the wall from which the jet issues. it is argued that the closed flow around the jet imposes an adverse pressure gradient on the wall, on the downstream lateral sides of the jet, provoking 'separation events’ in the wall boundary layer on each side. these result in eruptions of boundary-layer fluid and formation of wake vortices that are convected downstream. the measured wake strouhal frequencies, which depend on the jet-crossflow velocity ratio, match the measured frequencies of the separation events. the wake structure is most orderly and the corresponding wake strouhal number (0.13) is most sharply defined for velocity ratios near the value 4. measured wake profiles show deficits of both momentum and total pressure.
distraction using the buzzy for children during an iv insertion. aim to assess the effect of distraction (looking through kaleidoscopes) to reduce perceived pain, during venipuncture in healthy school-age children.   background distraction has been noted to be an effective method to help children cope with painful procedures. in the studies carried out, although it was found out that distraction made with different distracters reduced the pain of venipuncture, there is only one study confirming analgesic effect of distracters.   design the study was carried out as an intervention-control group design.   method children (n = 206), in whom venipuncture was applied in a laboratory for examination between the dates january-september 2006, were included in the study. the data were obtained by a form determining introductory features of the children and wong-baker faces pain rating scale and visual analogue scale evaluating the pain. descriptive statistics was used in the assessment of the data and t-test was used in comparisons of dependent-independent groups.   results pain levels of the children according to both scales in intervention group were lower than those of control group. but, it was detected that the distinction between score averages of intervention and control group of wong-baker faces pain rating scale, not visual analogue scale, was statistically significant (p < 0.001).   conclusion it was detected that the distraction made with kaleidoscope effectively reduced the pain related to venipuncture in healthy school children and that some features of the children influenced the perception of pain.   relevance to clinical practice distraction with kaleidoscope is a method, which the nurse will be able to use for venipuncture to obtain optimal pain control. in addition, it is important for a nurse to know some features about the children for a pain free and positive experience.
disease resistance in the drywood termite, incisitermes schwarzi: does nesting ecology affect immunocompetence? abstract the benefit of sociality in relation to disease susceptibility was studied in the dampwood termite zootermopsis angusticollis. although contact with high concentrations of fungal conidia is lethal, the survivorship of nymphs exposed to spore suspensions ranging from 6 × 106 to 2 × 108 spores/ml of the fungus metarhizium anisopliae increased with group size. the survivorship (measured as lt50) of isolated individuals ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 days, but infected nymphs living in groups of 10 and 25 individuals survived significantly longer (5.6–8.3 and 5.6–9.1 days, respectively). in most cases, there were no significant differences in the survival distributions of the 10- and 25-termite groups. when nymphs were infected with concentrations of 7 × 101–7 × 104 spores/ml and allowed to interact with healthy nestmates, fungal infections were not contracted by the unexposed termites. moreover, infected termites benefitted from social contact with unexposed nestmates: their survival rates were significantly higher than those of infected termites living with similarly infected nestmates. allogrooming, which increased in frequency during and after exposure to conidia, appeared to remove potentially infectious spores from the cuticle, thus increasing termite survivorship. these results suggest that allogrooming plays a crucial role in the control of disease and its death hazard in termites. the infection-reducing advantage of group living may have been significant in the evolution of social behavior in the isoptera.
patterns of comorbidity in community-dwelling older people hospitalised for fall-related injury: a cluster analysis objectives to document the burden of in-hospital falls and fractures, and to identify factors that may increase the risk of these events. design a retrospective cohort analysis setting the study was set in the state of victoria, australia. participants hospital episode data collected in the victoria admitted episodes dataset, for all multiday-stay patients 18 years or more admitted to victorian public hospitals; 1 july 1998 to 30 june 2008. diagnoses were defined by the international classification of disease, 10th revision, australian modification (icd-10-am), which includes an in-hospital diagnostic timing code. outcome measures included rates of in-hospital falls and fractures, length of hospital stay and mortality. variables included in risk adjustment included financial year, individual demographic and comorbidity data, and hospital characteristics. results there were 3 345 415 episodes: 21 250 (0.64%) in-hospital falls and 4559 (0.14%) fractures. in-hospital fall (ihf) episode rates increased over the study period, but fracture episode rates were stable. mortality (hr 1.3, ci 1.3 to 1.5) and length of stay (median 19 days vs 5 days, p<0.0001) were increased with ihf. risk factors for ihf included dementia (rate ratio 1.7, ci 1.6 to 1.8) and delirium (rate ratio 1.8, ci 1.6 to 2.0). conclusions routinely collected data that include a hospital diagnostic timing code offer a standard method of quantifying in-hospital falls and fractures. unselected in-hospital falls data may be subject to reporting and documentation bias. the utility of using robust selected injuries such as ihf-related fracture as a quality-of-care indicator requires further investigation.
impact of energy policy instruments on the estimated level of underlying energy efficiency in the eu residential sector energy demand, and in particular electricity demand in india has been growing at a very rapid rate over the last decade. given, current trends in population growth, industrialisation, urbanisation, modernisation and income growth, electricity consumption is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades as well. tariff reforms could play a potentially important role as a demand side management tool in india. however, the effects of any price revisions on consumption will depend on the price elasticity of demand for electricity. in the past, electricity demand studies for india published in international journals have been based on aggregate macro data at the country or sub-national/ state level. in this paper, price and income elasticities of electricity demand in the residential sector of all urban areas of india are estimated for the first time using disaggregate level survey data for over thirty thousand households. three electricity demand functions have been estimated using monthly data for the following seasons: winter, monsoon and summer. the results show electricity demand is income and price inelastic in all three seasons, and that household, demographic and geographical variables are important in determining electricity demand, something that is not possible to determine using aggregate macro models alone.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
investigating the effects of noise-estimation errors in simulated cochlear implant speech intelligibility the present study investigates the most important factors that limit the intelligibility of the cochlear implant (ci) processed speech in noisy environments. the electrical stimulation sequences provided in cis are affected by the noise in the following three manners. first of all, the natural gaps in the speech are filled, which distorts the low-frequency on/off modulations of the speech signal. secondly, speech envelopes are distorted to include modulations of both speech and noise. lastly, the n-of-m type of speech coding strategies may select the noise dominated channels instead of the dominant speech channels at low signal-to-noise ratio's (snrs). different stimulation sequences are tested with ci subjects to study how these three noise effects individually limit the intelligibility of the ci processed speech. tests are also conducted with normal hearing (nh) subjects using vocoded speech to identify any significant differences in the noise reduction requirements and speech distortion limitations between the two subject groups. results indicate that compared to nh subjects ci subjects can tolerate significantly lower levels of steady state speech shaped noise in the speech gaps but at the same time can tolerate comparable levels of distortions in the speech segments. furthermore, modulations in the stimulus current level have no effect on speech intelligibility as long as the channel selection remains ideal. finally, wrong maxima selection together with the introduction of noise in the speech gaps significantly degrades the intelligibility. at low snrs wrong maxima selection introduces interruptions in the speech and makes it difficult to fuse noisy and interrupted speech signals into a coherent speech stream.
early head movements elicited by visual stimuli or collicular electrical stimulation in the cat 1. the input-output connectivity, in cat, of tectoreticular (trns) and tectoreticulospinal (trsns) neurons [together called tr(s)ns] suggests a role for these cells in the sensorimotor transformations necessary for controlling orienting behavior. multimodal sensory information converges directly onto these tectal neurons, and they project to several brain stem and spinal cord centers involved in the control of eye- and head-orienting movements. in this and the following two papers, we describe the sensorimotor discharges of antidromically identified tr(s)ns. here we describe the process of localizing and identifying them, characteristics of both their antidromic and sensory responses, and effects of behavioral context on these responses. 2. in 13 alert, chronically prepared cats, a total of 293 neurons were antidromically identified from either the predorsal bundle (pdb) immediately rostral to abducens nucleus or the ventromedial funiculus of the spinal cord at the level of the first cervical vertebra (c1). the cell bodies of all identified tr(s)ns were confined to the intermediate and deep laminae of the superior colliculus (sc). the antidromic nature of the action potential evoked by stimulating either the pdb or c1 was verified by the use of a number of established criteria, including collision testing. 3. the mean antidromic latency from the pdb (trns + trsns) was 0.84 +/- 0.59 (sd) ms (n = 217). the conduction velocities of all cells activated by pdb stimulation ranged from 4 to 40 m/s. the mean latency from c1 (trsns) was 1.03 +/- 0.52 ms (sd) (n = 64), whereas conduction velocities ranged from 14 to 80 m/s. 4. one hundred thirty-eight tr(s)ns were studied long enough to yield significant data regarding their involvement in visuomotor-orienting behavior. ninety-eight percent (130/133) of the tr(s)ns tested for visual responses could be induced to discharge action potentials in response to some form of visual stimulation. the other three neurons remained silent, even in response to the most provocative stimuli. these silent neurons nevertheless were shown to be depolarized by visual stimuli. tr(s)ns were occasionally tested for auditory and somatosensory responses and some were multimodal. 5. tr(s)ns had visual receptive fields that conformed to the retinotopic map of the visual field that is represented within the sc. cells found in the lateral sc had receptive fields located in the lower visual field, whereas neurons that were situated medially had receptive fields in the upper visual field. cells found in the rostral sc had small fields that included a representation of the area centralis.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
intervention strategies for spatial orientation disorders in dementia: a selective review cognitive decline associated with old age and consistent with the diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia is a unique clinical syndrome with characteristic phenomena and progression. the authors describe a global deterioration scale for the assessment of primary degenerative dementia and delineation of its stages. the authors have used the global deterioration scale successfully for more than 5 years and have validated it against behavioral, neuroanatomic, and neurophysiologic measures in patients with primary degenerative dementia.
design, data, and theory regarding a digital hand inclinometer: a portable device for studying slant perception a dramatic failure of orientation constancy is documented in the perception of downhill slopes. contrary to naïve expectation, steep downhill slopes look shallower from the edge than they do from back from the edge. three experiments document and quantify this failure of constancy for real and virtual surfaces using a variety of dependent measures. two additional studies document overestimation of both non-visually perceived head pitch and perceived gaze declination. a model of orientation constancy failure is fit to the data that combine exaggerations in perceived gaze declination with exaggerated scaling of perceived optical slant. these findings support a functional scale-expansion model of error in slope perception.
cutting the visual world into bigger slices for improved video concept detection. (amélioration de la détection des concepts dans les vidéos en coupant de plus grandes tranches du monde visuel) we present a learning-based approach to the semantic indexing of multimedia content using cues derived from audio, visual, and text features. we approach the problem by developing a set of statistical models for a predefined lexicon. novel concepts are then mapped in terms of the concepts in the lexicon. to achieve robust detection of concepts, we exploit features from multiple modalities, namely, audio, video, and text. concept representations are modeled using gaussian mixture models (gmm), hidden markov models (hmm), and support vector machines (svm). models such as bayesian networks and svms are used in a late-fusion approach to model concepts that are not explicitly modeled in terms of features. our experiments indicate promise in the proposed classification and fusion methodologies: our proposed fusion scheme achieves more than 10% relative improvement over the best unimodal concept detector.
competitive effects of non-native plants are lowest in native plant communities that are most vulnerable to invasion ecological restoration typically seeks to shift species composition toward that of existing reference sites. yet, comparing the assemblages in restored and reference habitats assumes that similarity to the reference habitat is the optimal outcome of restoration and does not provide a perspective on regionally rare off-site species. when no such reference assemblages of species exist, an accurate assessment of the habitat affinities of species is crucial. we present a method for using a species by habitat data matrix generated by biodiversity surveys to evaluate community responses to habitat restoration treatments. habitats within the region are rated on their community similarity to a hypothetical restored habitat, other habitats of conservation concern, and disturbed habitats. similarity scores are reinserted into the species by habitat matrix to produce indicator (i) scores for each species in relation to these habitats. we apply this procedure to an open woodland restoration project in north mississippi (u.s.a.) by evaluating initial plant community responses to restoration. results showed a substantial increase in open woodland indicators, a modest decrease in generalists historically restricted to floodplain forests, and no significant change in disturbance indicators as a group. these responses can be interpreted as a desirable outcome, regardless of whether species composition approaches that of reference sites. the broader value of this approach is that it provides a flexible and objective means of predicting and evaluating the outcome of restoration projects involving any group of species in any region, provided there is a biodiversity database that includes habitat and location information.
multivariate analysis of founder specific inbreeding depression effects in pirenaica beef cattle the severity of inbreeding depression appears to vary among taxa, but few ecological or other patterns have been identified that predict accurately which taxa are most sensitive to inbreeding. to examine the causes of heterogeneity in inbreeding depression, the effects of inbreeding on reproduction, survival, and growth were measured in three replicate experimental stocks for each of three subspecies of peromyscus polionotus mice. inbreeding of the dam reduced the probability of breeding, the probability of producing a second litter, and litter size. inbreeding of the litter caused depression of litter size, juvenile viability, and mass at weaning, and caused an increase in the within‐litter variance in mass. in spite of differences between the subspecies in natural population sizes, genetic variation, and mean rates of reproduction and survival, all variation observed between experimental populations in their responses to inbreeding could be attributed to random founder effects. the genetic load of deleterious alleles in each replicate was unequally partitioned among its founder pairs, and different founders contributed to the load affecting different fitness components. thus, inbreeding depression for any one fitness component, in our experimental environment, must be due to relatively few deleterious alleles with major effects. genetic loads so comprised would be expected to diverge among natural populations due to both random drift and selective removal of recessive deleterious alleles during population bottlenecks. the near universality of inbreeding depression would be maintained, however, if different alleles contribute to inbreeding depression of different fitness components and in different environments.
how does the carboxyl terminus assist folding and er export of the serotonin transporter? the transporters for serotonin (sert), dopamine, and noradrenaline have a conserved hydrophobic core but divergent n and c termini. the c terminus harbors the binding site for the coat protein complex ii (copii) cargo-binding protein sec24. here we explored which sec24 isoform was required for export of sert from the endoplasmic reticulum (er). three lines of evidence argue that sert can only exit the er by recruiting sec24c: (i) mass spectrometry showed that a peptide corresponding to the c terminus of sert recruited sec24c-containing copii complexes from mouse brain lysates. (ii) depletion of individual sec24 isoforms by sirnas revealed that sert was trapped in the er only if sec24c was down-regulated, in both, cells that expressed sert endogenously or after transfection. the combination of all sirnas was not more effective than that directed against sec24c. a sert mutant in which the sec24c-binding motif (607ri608) was replaced by alanine was insensitive to down-regulation of sec24c levels. (iii) overexpression of a sec24c variant with a mutation in the candidate cargo-binding motif (sec24c-d796v/d797n) but not of the corresponding mutant sec24d-d733v/d734n reduced sert surface levels. in contrast, noradrenaline and dopamine transporters and the more distantly related gaba transporter 1 relied on sec24d for er export. these observations demonstrate that closely related transporters are exclusive client cargo proteins for different sec24 isoforms. the short promoter polymorphism results in reduced sert cell surface levels and renders affected individuals more susceptible to depression. by inference, variations in the sec24c gene may also affect sert cell surface levels and thus be linked to mood disorders.
high‐speed whole‐brain oximetry by golden‐angle radial mri in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (mri) studies, the motion kinetics or the contrast variability are often hard to predict, hampering an appropriate choice of the image update rate or the temporal resolution. a constant azimuthal profile spacing (111.246deg), based on the golden ratio, is investigated as optimal for image reconstruction from an arbitrary number of profiles in radial mri. the profile order is evaluated and compared with a uniform profile distribution in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (snr) and artifact level. the favorable characteristics of such a profile order are exemplified in two applications on healthy volunteers. first, an advanced sliding window reconstruction scheme is applied to dynamic cardiac imaging, with a reconstruction window that can be flexibly adjusted according to the extent of cardiac motion that is acceptable. second, a contrast-enhancing k-space filter is presented that permits reconstructing an arbitrary number of images at arbitrary time points from one raw data set. the filter was utilized to depict the t1-relaxation in the brain after a single inversion prepulse. while a uniform profile distribution with a constant angle increment is optimal for a fixed and predetermined number of profiles, a profile distribution based on the golden ratio proved to be an appropriate solution for an arbitrary number of profiles
interaction between prenatal growth and high-risk genotypes in the development of type 2 diabetes we have recently proposed a series of indexes for β-cell function and insulin sensitivity to be calculated from glucose and insulin concentrations obtained during a classic world health organization oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) (1). the models were validated by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic and the hyperglycemic clamp technique, respectively. the generation of these indexes was based on simple statistical models using stepwise linear regression analysis. the variables in the model assumed the availability of determinations at 0, 30, …
genome-wide association study in east asians identifies novel susceptibility loci for breast cancer the authors describe the design and implementation of a large multiethnic cohort established to study diet and cancer in the united states. they detail the source of the subjects, sample size, questionnaire development, pilot work, and approaches to future analyses. the cohort consists of 215,251 adult men and women (age 45-75 years at baseline) living in hawaii and in california (primarily los angeles county) with the following ethnic distribution: african-american (16.3%), latino (22.0%), japanese-american (26.4%), native hawaiian (6.5%), white (22.9%), and other ancestry (5.8%). from 1993 to 1996, participants entered the cohort by completing a 26-page, self-administered mail questionnaire that elicited a quantitative food frequency history, along with demographic and other information. response rates ranged from 20% in latinos to 49% in japanese-americans. as expected, both within and among ethnic groups, the questionnaire data show substantial variations in dietary intakes (nutrients as well as foods) and in the distributions of non-dietary risk factors (including smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical activity). when compared with corresponding ethnic-specific cancer incidence rates, the findings provide tentative support for several current dietary hypotheses. as sufficient numbers of cancer cases are identified through surveillance of the cohort, dietary and other hypotheses will be tested in prospective analyses.
combination of angiotensin ii receptor blockers promotes proton pump inhibitor-based healing of reflux esophagitis reflux esophagitis is divided into four grades, i.e. grade a to d, according to the severity of its mucosal break in the endoscopic classification of reflux esophagitis (los angels classification). in our study, only 14.3% of patients with heartburn had grade a to d during endoscopy. this means that los angels classification is insufficient at least in japan. then we have claimed that grade m and grade n are to be included in this classification, which mean minimal change and no lesions, respectively.
multiple windowed spectral features for emotion recognition the aim of this paper is to find a multiple window estimator that is mean square error optimal for cepstrum estimation. the estimator is compared with some known multiple window methods as well as with the parametric ar-estimator. the results show that the new estimator has high performance, especially for data with large spectral dynamics, and that it is also robust against parameter choices. simulated speech data is used for the evaluation. it is also shown that the windows of the estimator can be approximated with the sinusoidal multiple windows and that the weighting factors of the different periodograms can be analytically computed.
sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning in this paper we describe a method for simplifying sentences using phrase based machine translation, augmented with a re-ranking heuristic based on dissimilarity, and trained on a monolingual parallel corpus. we compare our system to a word-substitution baseline and two state-of-the-art systems, all trained and tested on paired sentences from the english part of wikipedia and simple wikipedia. human test subjects judge the output of the different systems. analysing the judgements shows that by relatively careful phrase-based paraphrasing our model achieves similar simplification results to state-of-the-art systems, while generating better formed output. we also argue that text readability metrics such as the flesch-kincaid grade level should be used with caution when evaluating the output of simplification systems.
atom decomposition with adaptive basis selection strategy for matrix completion low rank matrix completion has been applied successfully in a wide range of machine learning applications, such as collaborative filtering, image inpainting and microarray data imputation. however, many existing algorithms are not scalable to large-scale problems, as they involve computing singular value decomposition. in this paper, we present an efficient and scalable algorithm for matrix completion. the key idea is to extend the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit from the vector case to the matrix case. in each iteration, we pursue a rank-one matrix basis generated by the top singular vector pair of the current approximation residual and update the weights for all rank-one matrices obtained up to the current iteration. we further propose a novel weight updating rule to reduce the time and storage complexity, making the proposed algorithm scalable to large matrices. we establish the linear convergence of the proposed algorithm. the fast convergence is achieved due to the proposed construction of matrix bases and the estimation of the weights. we empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm on many real-world large-scale datasets. results show that our algorithm is much more efficient than state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms while achieving similar or better prediction performance.
a sustainability assessment of a health equity fund initiative in cambodia. sustainability continues to be a serious concern for primary health care (phc) interventions targeting the death of millions of children in developing countries each year. our work with over 30 non-governmental organizations (ngos) implementing usaid's child survival and health grants program (cshgp)-funded projects revealed the need for a study to develop a framework for sustainability assessment in these projects. we surveyed ngo informants and project managers through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. this paper summarizes our study findings. the ngos share key values about sustainability, but are skeptical about approaches perceived as disconnected from field reality. in their experience, sustainable achievements occur through the interaction of capable local stakeholders and communities. this depends strongly on enabling conditions, which ngo projects should advance. sustainability assessment is multidimensional, value-based and embeds health within a larger sustainable development perspective. it reduces, but does not eliminate, the unpredictability of long-term outcomes. it should start with the consideration of the 'local systems' which need to develop a common purpose. our ability to address the complexity inherent to sustainability thinking rests with the validity of the models used to design interventions. a participant, qualitative research approach helped us make sense of sustainability in ngo field practice.
tubulin-based structure-affinity relationships for antimitotic vinca alkaloids. we are pushed willy-nilly into this incredibly complex universe at a particular point in time, in n-dimensional space, for an almost instantaneous blick around and then pass into oblivion. first, consider the usual three dimensions. a single human is about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times smaller than the earth it momentarily inhabits, but the earth is so insignificant. it is a speck circling the sun that is 2,000,000 times larger. however, the sun is an ordinary star embedded with 100,000,000,000 stars in our galaxy. but our galaxy is only one of around 50,000,000,000 galaxies. only very slowly during the past 500 years have people begun to develop some feeling for the fact that they and the earth are not the center of the universe. fifty years ago, there were astronomers who thought that the earth, with man, was possibly unique in the universe. today most have little doubt that life something like ours occurs elsewhere. however, even communicating with a very near star, say 20 light years away, would be virtually impossible. an exchange of messages would require 40 years! it is about 10–15 billion light years to the edge of the universe. almost everything is beyond our reach for the foreseeable future, but that does not mean it is of no importance (a light year is about 5,000,000,000,000 miles). now considering a fourth dimension, time, we shrink still further in significance. life on earth has been evolving for over a billion years, but only in the last few 1,000 years have we begun to leave some kind of written record. it is highly likely that the earth will survive another billion or more years. what will the history of the last (primitive) few 1,000 years mean in 500,000 years, or 10,000,000 years! the accumulation of data in the form of history (even at the present very slow rate) will be gargantuan. this leads to a fifth dimension that is overwhelming. already we are adrift in a huge cloud of information from the past brief moment of recorded history. for example, the library of congress acquired its 100,000,000th item in 1992. the collection at that time contained about 15,000,000 books, 39,000,000 manuscripts, 13,000,000 photographs, 4,000,000 maps, 3,500,000 pieces of music and 500,000 motion pictures. how many of these books can a person consider in say, 50 years? one might read 5,000 books, but which ones? what the many older libraries of europe and asia contain is incredible. of course much of our reading is squandered on escape literature, such as mysteries, light headed novels, cheap newspapers, etc. from my own point of view, i am aghast at what is happening in the single area of chemistry. with most of the world not yet participating, the abstracts of over 2,000 articles and patents appear daily! if you miss 10 days, you fall behind over 20,000 reports. libraries are finally beginning to realize that they cannot continue to collect such huge volumes of work on paper. just in time, the internet, on which anyone or everyone can have one or more web sites and on which unlimited information can be stored, has arrived. people are now publishing their own novels and scientific papers on the web. it has been said that within a few years, a billion computers around the world will be connected via the internet and the web. the distillation of honest and relevant information out of this babble remains a work in progress. how much of it has already been lost or buried? c. hansch (&) pomona college, claremont, ca, usa e-mail: cselassie@pomona.edu
the effects of local, buffer zone and geographical variables on lake plankton metacommunities summary  1. statistical tests partitioning community variation into environmental and spatial components have been widely used to test ecological theories and explore the determinants of community structure for applied conservation questions. despite the wide use of these tests, there is considerable debate about their relative effectiveness.    2. we used simulated communities to evaluate the most commonly employed tests that partition community variation: regression on distance matrices and canonical ordination using a third-order polynomial, principal components of neighbour matrices (pcnm) or moran’s eigenvector maps (mem) to model spatial components. each test was evaluated under a variety of realistic sampling scenarios.    3. all tests failed to correctly model spatial and environmental components of variation, and in some cases produced biased estimates of the relative importance of components. regression on distance matrices under-fit the spatial component, and ordination models consistently under-fit the environmental component. the pcnm and mem approaches often produced inflated r2 statistics, apparently as a result of statistical artefacts involving selection of superfluous axes. this problem occurred regardless of the forward-selection technique used.    4. both sample configuration and the underlying linear model used to analyse species–environment relationships also revealed strong potential to bias results.    5. synthesis and applications. several common applications of variation partitioning in ecology now appear inappropriate. these potentially include decisions for community conservation based on inferred relative strengths of niche and dispersal processes, inferred community responses to climate change, and numerous additional analyses that depend on precise results from multivariate variation-partitioning techniques. we clarify the appropriate uses of these analyses in research programmes, and outline potential steps to improve them.
probabilistic forecast for twenty-first-century climate based on uncertainties in emissions (without policy) and climate parameters. we derive joint probability density distributions for three key uncertain properties of the climate system, using an optimal fingerprinting approach to compare simulations of an intermediate complexity climate model with three distinct diagnostics of recent climate observations. on the basis of the marginal probability distributions, the 5 to 95% confidence intervals are 1.4 to 7.7 kelvin for climate sensitivity and −0.30 to −0.95 watt per square meter for the net aerosol forcing. the oceanic heat uptake is not well constrained, but ocean temperature observations do help to constrain climate sensitivity. the uncertainty in the net aerosol forcing is much smaller than the uncertainty range for the indirect aerosol forcing alone given in the intergovernmental panel on climate change third assessment report.
rhob is associated with the anti-angiogenic effects of celiac patient transglutaminase 2-targeted autoantibodies coeliac disease is characterized by immunoglobulin‐a (iga)‐class autoantibodies targeted against transglutaminase 2 (tg2), a multi‐functional protein also with a role in angiogenesis. these antibodies are present in patient serum but are also found bound to tg2 below the epithelial basement membrane and around capillaries in the small intestinal mucosa. based on these facts and the information that the mucosal vasculature of coeliac patients on a gluten‐containing diet is disorganized, we studied whether the coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies targeted against tg2 would disturb angiogenesis. the effects of coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies on in vitro angiogenesis were studied in angiogenic cell cultures. the binding of the antibodies to cells, endothelial sprouting, migration of both endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells, the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton in both cell types and the differentiation of vascular mesenchymal cells were recorded. in vitro, iga derived from coeliac disease patients on a gluten‐containing diet binds to surface tg2 on endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells and this binding can be inhibited by the removal of tg2. in addition, coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies targeting tg2 disturb several steps of angiogenesis: endothelial sprouting and the migration of both endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells. furthermore, the autoantibodies cause disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in both capillary cell types that account most probably for the defective cellular migration. we conclude that coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies recognizing tg2 inhibit angiogenesis in vitro. this disturbance of the angiogenic process could lead in vivo to the disruption of the mucosal vasculature seen in coeliac disease patients on a gluten‐containing diet.
neck muscle afferents influence oromotor and cardiorespiratory brainstem neural circuits choline acetyltransferase (chat; ec ) catalyzes the reversible synthesis of acetylcholine (ach) from acetyl coa and choline at cholinergic synapses. mutations in genes encoding chat affecting motility exist in caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila, but no chat mutations have been observed in humans to date. here we report that mutations in chat cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome associated with frequently fatal episodes of apnea (cms-ea). studies of the neuromuscular junction in this disease show a stimulation-dependent decrease of the amplitude of the miniature endplate potential and no deficiency of the ach receptor. these findings point to a defect in ach resynthesis or vesicular filling and to chat as one of the candidate genes. direct sequencing of chat reveals 10 recessive mutations in five patients with cms-ea. one mutation (523inscc) is a frameshifting null mutation. three mutations (i305t, r420c, and e441k) markedly reduce chat expression in cos cells. kinetic studies of nine bacterially expressed chat mutants demonstrate that one mutant (e441k) lacks catalytic activity, and eight mutants (l210p, p211a, i305t, r420c, r482g, s498l, v506l, and r560h) have significantly impaired catalytic efficiencies.
bounded outcome score modeling: application to treating psoriasis with ustekinumab subject withdrawal from a study (also called dropout, or right censoring), is common in late phase clinical trials. a number of methods dealing with dropouts have been used in practice, the most common being “last observation carried forward” (locf). many of these methods, including locf, can result in biased estimates of the efficacy or potency of the drug, especially in the modeling context. if the likelihood of dropout is correlated to the underlying unobserved data, the dropout is informative and should not be ignored in the modeling process. the topic of informative dropout in the context of longitudinal data has received much attention in the statistical literature, in the setting of linear and generalized linear models. we extend the approach to nonlinear models. the dropout hazard, as well as the longitudinal data, is modeled parametrically. parameters are estimated by maximizing the approximate joint likelihood as implemented in the software nonmem. using data from actual clinical trials, we explore the impact of the dropout model on the ability of the joint model to predict observed longitudinal data patterns.
value of the proximal flow convergence method for quantification of the regurgitant volume in mitral regurgitation objectives this study was designed to examine the accuracy of proximal accelerating flow calculations in estimating regurgitant flow rate or volume in patients with different types of mitral valve disease.   background flow acceleration proximal to a regurgitant orifice, observed with doppler color flow mapping, is constituted by isovelocity surfaces centered at the orifice. by conservation of mass, the flow rate through each isovelocity surface equals the flow rate through the regurgitant orifice.   methods forty-six adults with mitral regurgitation of angiographic grades i to iv were studied. the proximal accelerating flow rate (q) was calculated by: q = 2 pi r2.vn, where pi r2 is the area of the hemisphere and vn is the nyquist velocity. radius of the hemisphere (r) was measured from two-dimensional or m-mode doppler color recording. from the m-mode color study, integration of accelerating flow rate throughout systole yielded stroke accelerating flow volume and mean flow rate. mitral regurgitant flow rate and stroke regurgitant volume were measured by using a combination of pulsed wave doppler and two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of aortic forward flow and mitral inflow.   results the proximal accelerating flow region was observed in 42 of 46 patients. maximal accelerating flow measured from either two-dimensional (372 +/- 389 ml/s) or m-mode (406 +/- 421 ml/s) doppler color study tended to overestimate the mean regurgitant flow rate (306 +/- 253 ml/s, p < 0.05). mean doppler accelerating flow rate correlated well with mean regurgitant flow rate (r = 0.95, p < 0.001), although there was a tendency toward slight overestimation of mean regurgitant flow by mean accelerating flow in severe mitral regurgitation. however, there was no significant difference between the mean accelerating flow rate (318 +/- 304 ml/s) and the mean regurgitant flow rate (306 +/- 253 ml/s, p = ns) for all patients. a similar relation was found between accelerating flow stroke volume (78.27 +/- 62.72 ml) and regurgitant flow stroke volume (76.06 +/- 59.76 ml) (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). the etiology of mitral regurgitation did not appear to affect the relation between accelerating flow and regurgitant flow.   conclusions proximal accelerating flow rate calculated by the hemispheric model of the isovelocity surface was applicable and accurate in most patients with mitral regurgitation of a variety of causes. there was slight overestimation of regurgitant flow rate by accelerating flow rate when the regurgitant lesion was more severe.
identification and phylogenetic analyses of vast, an uncharacterized protein domain associated with lipid-binding domains in eukaryotes backgroundprediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. the community-wide critical assessment of structure prediction (casp) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where i-tasser was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th casp experiment. our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the i-tasser algorithm and the usage of the i-tasser predictions.resultsan on-line version of i-tasser is developed at the ku center for bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. a scoring function (c-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the i-tasser predictions. a large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the c-score and the tm-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. using a c-score cutoff > -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. combining c-score and protein length, the accuracy of the i-tasser models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for tm-score and 2 å for rmsd.conclusionthe i-tasser server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3d protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the i-tasser models. the output of the i-tasser server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated tm-score and rmsd, and the standard deviation of the estimations. the i-tasser server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/i-tasser.
elevated autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the smith–lemli–opitz syndrome our aim is to verify the validity of a rat model proposed for smith-lemli-opitz (slo) syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by a defect in 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7 (7dhc)-reductase and by facial dysmorphism close to the holoprosencephaly caused by the teratogen ay9944. we investigated the sterol profile in rats treated with ay9944 blocking 7dhc-reductase. ay9944 was given orally to rats on gestation day 3 (d3). the sera were sampled for kinetic data on d3, d6, d9, d12, and d21. cholesterol was measured in parallel by the routine enzymatic method and by the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc-ms) procedure used in slo diagnosis. in addition to sterols, we dosed steroid hormones punctually on d4 and on d10, and examined d21 fetuses in other animals. the enzymatic method was not specific for cholesterol, and measured 70% pure 7dhc added to a normal serum. on d21, 77% live fetuses showed pituitary agenesis. cholesterol was rapidly reduced by more than 50% on d6 involving an accumulation of 7dhc, 8dhc, and trienols, as identified in slo-affected children. the most abundant 7dhc reached a maximum from d9 to d12, equaling cholesterol on d9 (11 mg/dl). on d10, the magnitudes of hypocholesterolemic and of 7dhc accumulation were found to be dose-dependent. progesterone was reduced as early as 24 hr after treatment and dropped to 40% of the levels in the controls on d10, correlating to the decrease in cholesterolemia. this rat model reproduces the same biochemical perturbations as seen in slo, strongly suggesting that aberrant sterols (7dhc, 8dhc, or nortrienol) may contribute to the developmental defects.
test-time adaptation for 3d human pose estimation in this work, we address the problem of 3d pose estimation of multiple humans from multiple views. this is a more challenging problem than single human 3d pose estimation due to the much larger state space, partial occlusions as well as across view ambiguities when not knowing the identity of the humans in advance. to address these problems, we first create a reduced state space by triangulation of corresponding body joints obtained from part detectors in pairs of camera views. in order to resolve the ambiguities of wrong and mixed body parts of multiple humans after triangulation and also those coming from false positive body part detections, we introduce a novel 3d pictorial structures (3dps) model. our model infers 3d human body configurations from our reduced state space. the 3dps model is generic and applicable to both single and multiple human pose estimation. in order to compare to the state-of-the art, we first evaluate our method on single human 3d pose estimation on humaneva-i [22] and kth multiview football dataset ii [8] datasets. then, we introduce and evaluate our method on two datasets for multiple human 3d pose estimation. in order to compare to the state-of-the art, we first evaluate our method on single human 3d pose estimation on humaneva-i [22] and kth multiview football dataset ii [8] datasets. then, we introduce and evaluate our method on two datasets for multiple human 3d pose estimation.
the diaphragm and lubricant gel for prevention of cervical sexually transmitted infections: results of a randomized controlled trial the protective effect of barrier-method contraception against pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) was examined by analyzing data from the women's health study, a large multicenter case-control study. we compared the contraceptive methods used by 645 women hospitalized for initial episodes of pid with the contraceptive methods used by 2,509 control subjects reporting no history of pid. the risk of hospitalization for pid in women currently using barrier methods relative to women using all other methods and to women using no method of contraception was 0.6 (95% confidence limits, 0.5 to 0.9) for both comparisons. this protective effect was observed for both chemical and mechanical barrier methods, although it was not statistically significant for the former. the prevention of pid and its sequelae is one of the most important noncontraceptive benefits of barrier methods of contraception.
recognizing activities and spatial context using wearable sensors in the near future, it will be possible to continuously record and store the entire audio–visual lifetime of a person together with all digital information that the person perceives or creates. while the storage of this data will be possible soon, retrieval and indexing into such large data sets are unsolved challenges. since today’s retrieval cues seem insufficient we argue that additional cues, obtained from body-worn sensors, make associative retrieval by humans possible. we present three approaches to create such cues, each along with an experimental evaluation: the user’s physical activity from acceleration sensors, his social environment from audio sensors, and his interruptibility from multiple sensors.
semisupervised metric learning by kernel matrix adaptation many supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are very sensitive to the choice of an appropriate distance metric. while classification tasks can make use of class label information for metric learning, such information is generally unavailable in conventional clustering tasks. some recent research sought to address a variant of the conventional clustering problem called semi-supervised clustering, which performs clustering in the presence of some background knowledge or supervisory information expressed as pairwise similarity or dissimilarity constraints. however, existing metric learning methods for semi-supervised clustering mostly perform global metric learning through a linear transformation. in this paper, we propose a new metric learning method which performs nonlinear transformation globally but linear transformation locally. in particular, we formulate the learning problem as an optimization problem and present two methods for solving it. through some toy data sets, we show empirically that our locally linear metric adaptation (llma) method can handle some difficult cases that cannot be handled satisfactorily by previous methods. we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on some real data sets.
smoothing syntax-based semantic spaces: let the winner take it all the recently introduced continuous skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. in this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. by subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. we also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling.    an inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. for example, the meanings of "canada" and "air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "air canada". motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.
should we have blind faith in bioinformatics software? illustrations from the snap web-based tool consider table 1. it represents in its formal characteristics a situation which arises in the clinical-social-personality areas of psychology, where it frequently occurs that the only useful level of measurement obtainable is nominal scaling (stevens, 1951, pp. 2526), i.e. placement in a set of k unordered categories. because the categorizing of the units is a consequence of some complex judgment process performed by a &dquo;two-legged meter&dquo; (stevens, 1958), it becomes important to determine the extent to which these judgments are reproducible, i.e., reliable. the procedure which suggests itself is that of having two (or more) judges independently categorize a sample of units and determine the degree, significance, and
low-dose tibolone (1.25 mg/d) does not affect muscle strength in older women the aim of our study was to test grip strength and assess the effects of various degrees of standardization on repeatability and level of peak force. sixteen healthy persons and eight subjects with an impaired hand function have been tested using a strain-gauge dynamometer. we compared four measurement protocols: (a) the subject is free to assume a comfortable arm position; (b) the subject is also free to assume a comfortable arm position but in addition a challenging stimulus to exceed a previous maximal effort, is given; (c) the arm was held in a predescribed and partly fixated position, as recommended by the american society of hand therapists; (d) the position of the dynamometer is standardized using two reference points both on the hand and on the dynamometer. we found high test-retest reliabilities for each measurement protocol without any significant difference. there were, however, significant differences in strength level. with measurements according to protocol b the highest peak values were noted. since the measurement protocol b combined good reliability with realistic peak forces, this procedure seems most suitable for grip strength measurements.
software quality economics for defect-detection techniques using failure prediction how can we determine the added value of software verification techniques over the more readily available conventional testing techniques? formal verification techniques introduce both added costs and potential benefits. can we show objectively when the benefits will outweigh the cost?
the importance of listening: juvenile allocation shifts in response to acoustic cues of the social environment the acquisition of resources is an important determinant of patterns of variation in and covariation among traits that are costly to produce and are dependent on condition for their expression. however, the extent to which variation in female mate choice behavior is condition dependent, and how this is related to other life‐history traits, remains largely unknown. we manipulated the acquisition of dietary protein in the black field cricket, teleogryllus commodus, and measured the effects of this on several important life‐history traits and on female mate choice behavior. females reared on a high‐protein diet developed faster, were heavier at eclosion, and lived longer than females reared on a low‐protein diet. two lines of evidence suggest that female mate choice behavior in t. commodus is condition dependent. first, females reared on the high‐protein diet were more sexually responsive and expressed stronger linear and quadratic preference functions for call rate and dominant frequency, respectively. second, within treatments, females that developed faster were lighter, generally less sexually responsive, and, in the high‐protein‐diet treatment, expressed weaker preferences than slower‐developing females. collectively, our findings suggest an important role for resource acquisition in generating variation in mate choice behavior.
potential health impact of ultrafine particles under clean and polluted urban atmospheric conditions: a model-based study in order to assess the effect of air pollution on pediatric respiratory morbidity, we carried out a time series study using daily levels of pm10, so2, no2, ozone, and co and daily numbers of pediatric respiratory emergency room visits and hospital admissions at the children's institute of the university of sao paulo medical school, from august 1996 to august 1997. in this period there were 43,635 hospital emergency room visits, 4534 of which were due to lower respiratory tract disease. the total number of hospital admissions was 6785, 1021 of which were due to lower respiratory tract infectious and/or obstructive diseases. the three health end-points under investigation were the daily number of emergency room visits due to lower respiratory tract diseases, hospital admissions due to pneumonia, and hospital admissions due to asthma or bronchiolitis. generalized additive poisson regression models were fitted, controlling for smooth functions of time, temperature and humidity, and an indicator of weekdays. no2 was positively associated with all outcomes. interquartile range increases (65.04 microg/m3) in no2 moving averages were associated with an 18.4% increase (95% confidence interval, 95% ci = 12.5-24.3) in emergency room visits due to lower respiratory tract diseases (4-day moving average), a 17.6% increase (95% ci = 3.3-32.7) in hospital admissions due to pneumonia or bronchopneumonia (3-day moving average), and a 31.4% increase (95% ci = 7.2-55.7) in hospital admissions due to asthma or bronchiolitis (2-day moving average). the study showed that air pollution considerably affects children's respiratory morbidity, deserving attention from the health authorities.
multi-task gaussian process learning of robot inverse dynamics multitask learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. it does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. this paper reviews prior work on mtl, presents new evidence that mtl in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for mtl with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. in this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. we explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. we present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.
accelerating reachability query processing based on $$\varvec{dag}$$dag reduction reachability query is a fundamental graph operation which answers whether a vertex can reach another vertex over a large directed graph g with n vertices and m edges, and has been extensively studied. in the literature, all the approaches compute a label for every vertex in a graph g by index construction offline. the query time for answering reachability queries online is affected by the quality of the labels computed in index construction. the three main costs are the index construction time, the index size, and the query time. some of the up-to-date approaches can answer reachability queries efficiently, but spend non-linear time to construct an index. some of the up-to-date approaches construct an index in linear time and space, but may need to depth-first search g at run-time in o(n + m). in this paper, as the first, we propose a new randomized labeling approach to answer reachability queries, and the randomness is by independent permutation. we conduct extensive experimental studies to compare with the up-to-date approaches using 19 large real datasets used in the existing work and synthetic datasets. we confirm the efficiency of our approach.
potential reporting bias in fmri studies of the brain a widely used technique for coordinate‐based meta‐analyses of neuroimaging data is activation likelihood estimation (ale). ale assesses the overlap between foci based on modeling them as probability distributions centered at the respective coordinates. in this human brain project/neuroinformatics research, the authors present a revised ale algorithm addressing drawbacks associated with former implementations. the first change pertains to the size of the probability distributions, which had to be specified by the used. to provide a more principled solution, the authors analyzed fmri data of 21 subjects, each normalized into mni space using nine different approaches. this analysis provided quantitative estimates of between‐subject and between‐template variability for 16 functionally defined regions, which were then used to explicitly model the spatial uncertainty associated with each reported coordinate. secondly, instead of testing for an above‐chance clustering between foci, the revised algorithm assesses above‐chance clustering between experiments. the spatial relationship between foci in a given experiment is now assumed to be fixed and ale results are assessed against a null‐distribution of random spatial association between experiments. critically, this modification entails a change from fixed‐ to random‐effects inference in ale analysis allowing generalization of the results to the entire population of studies analyzed. by comparative analysis of real and simulated data, the authors showed that the revised ale‐algorithm overcomes conceptual problems of former meta‐analyses and increases the specificity of the ensuing results without loosing the sensitivity of the original approach. it may thus provide a methodologically improved tool for coordinate‐based meta‐analyses on functional imaging data. hum brain mapp 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
comparing bona fide psychotherapies of depression in adults with two meta-analytical approaches although the subject has been debated and examined for more than 3 decades, it is still not clear whether all psychotherapies are equally efficacious. the authors conducted 7 meta-analyses (with a total of 53 studies) in which 7 major types of psychological treatment for mild to moderate adult depression (cognitive-behavior therapy, nondirective supportive treatment, behavioral activation treatment, psychodynamic treatment, problem-solving therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and social skills training) were directly compared with other psychological treatments. each major type of treatment had been examined in at least 5 randomized comparative trials. there was no indication that 1 of the treatments was more or less efficacious, with the exception of interpersonal psychotherapy (which was somewhat more efficacious; d = 0.20) and nondirective supportive treatment (which was somewhat less efficacious than the other treatments; d = -0.13). the drop-out rate was significantly higher in cognitive-behavior therapy than in the other therapies, whereas it was significantly lower in problem-solving therapy. this study suggests that there are no large differences in efficacy between the major psychotherapies for mild to moderate depression.
plasmodium falciparum nima-related kinase pfnek-1: sex specificity and assessment of essentiality for the erythrocytic asexual cycle the kinome of the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum includes two genes encoding mitogen‐activated protein kinase (mapk) homologues, pfmap‐1 and pfmap‐2, but no clear orthologue of the mapk kinase (mapkk) family, raising the question of the mode of activation and function of the plasmodial mapks. functional studies in the rodent malaria model plasmodium berghei recently showed the map‐2 gene to be dispensable for asexual growth and gametocytogenesis, but essential for male gametogenesis in the mosquito vector. here, we demonstrate by using a reverse genetics approach that the map‐2 gene is essential for completion of the asexual cycle of p. falciparum, an unexpected result in view of the non‐essentiality of the orthologous gene for p. berghei erythrocytic schizogony. this validates pfmap‐2 as a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention. in contrast, the other p. falciparum mapk, pfmap‐1, is required neither for in vitro schizogony and gametocytogenesis in erythrocytes, nor for gametogenesis and sporogony in the mosquito vector. however, pfmap‐2 protein levels are elevated in pfmap‐1‐ parasites, suggesting that pfmap‐1 fulfils an important function in asexual parasites that necessitates compensatory adaptation in parasites lacking this enzyme.
complementary anti-inflammatory effects of a β-blocker and a corticosteroid in an asthma model for many years, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers or betaar antagonists) have provided significant morbidity and mortality benefits in patients who have sustained acute myocardial infarction. more recently, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been found to provide survival benefits in patients suffering from heart failure, although the efficacy of different beta-blockers varies widely in this condition. one drug, carvedilol, a nonsubtype-selective betaar antagonist, has proven particularly effective in the treatment of heart failure, although the mechanism(s) responsible for this are controversial. here, we report that among 16 clinically relevant betaar antagonists, carvedilol displays a unique profile of in vitro signaling characteristics. we observed that in beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2ar)-expressing hek-293 cells, carvedilol has inverse efficacy for stimulating g(s)-dependent adenylyl cyclase but, nonetheless, stimulates (i) phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail on previously documented g protein-coupled receptor kinase sites; (ii) recruitment of beta-arrestin to the beta2ar; (iii) receptor internalization; and (iv) activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (erk 1/2), which is maintained in the g protein-uncoupled mutant beta2ar(t68f,y132g,y219a) (beta2ar(tyy)) and abolished by beta-arrestin2 sirna. taken together, these data indicate that carvedilol is able to stabilize a receptor conformation which, although uncoupled from g(s), is nonetheless able to stimulate beta-arrestin-mediated signaling. we hypothesize that such signaling may contribute to the special efficacy of carvedilol in the treatment of heart failure and may serve as a prototype for a new generation of therapeutic beta2ar ligands.
intelligent approaches to mining the primary research literature: techniques, systems, and examples support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world learning tasks. however, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance. in many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based active learning. instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. we introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. we provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space. we present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.
towards a global it system for personalized medicine: the medicine safety code initiative the pharmacogenetics knowledge base (pharmgkb; http://www.pharmgkb.org/) contains genomic, phenotype and clinical information collected from ongoing pharmacogenetic studies. tools to browse, query, download, submit, edit and process the information are available to registered research network members. a subset of the tools is publicly available. pharmgkb currently contains over 150 genes under study, 14 coriell populations and a large ontology of pharmacogenetics concepts. the pharmacogenetic concepts and the experimental data are interconnected by a set of relations to form a knowledge base of information for pharmacogenetic researchers. the information in pharmgkb, and its associated tools for processing that information, are tailored for leading-edge pharmacogenetics research. the pharmgkb project was initiated in april 2000 and the first version of the knowledge base went online in february 2001.
swarm aggregation using emotional learning based intelligent controller in this paper, we consider a control strategy of multiagent systems, or simply, swarms, based on artificial potential functions and the sliding-mode control technique. first, we briefly discuss a "kinematic" swarm model in n-dimensional space introduced in an earlier paper. in that model, the interindividual interactions are based on artificial potential functions, and the motion of the individuals is along the negative gradient of the combined potential. after that, we consider a general model for vehicle dynamics of each agent (swarm member), and use sliding-mode control theory to force their motion to obey the dynamics of the kinematic model. in this context, the results for the initial model serve as a "proof of concept" for multiagent coordination and control (swarm aggregation), whereas the present results serve as a possible implementation method for engineering swarms with given vehicle dynamics. the presented control scheme is robust with respect to disturbances and system uncertainties.
bayesian sparsification of recurrent neural networks we explore a recently proposed variational dropout technique that provided an elegant bayesian interpretation to gaussian dropout. we extend variational dropout to the case when dropout rates are unbounded, propose a way to reduce the variance of the gradient estimator and report first experimental results with individual dropout rates per weight. interestingly, it leads to extremely sparse solutions both in fully-connected and convolutional layers. this effect is similar to automatic relevance determination effect in empirical bayes but has a number of advantages. we reduce the number of parameters up to 280 times on lenet architectures and up to 68 times on vgg-like networks with a negligible decrease of accuracy.
basin hopping graph: a computational framework to characterize rna folding landscapes both the 68-base 5' leader (omega) and the 205-base 3' untranslated region (utr) of tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) promote efficient translation. a 35-base region within omega is necessary and sufficient for the regulation. within the 3' utr, a 52-base region, composed of two rna pseudoknots, is required for regulation. these pseudoknots are phylogenetically conserved among seven viruses from two different viral groups and one satellite virus. the pseudoknots contained significant conservation at the secondary and tertiary levels and at several positions at the primary sequence level. mutational analysis of the sequences determined that the primary sequence in several conserved positions, particularly within the third pseudoknot, was essential for function. the higher-order structure of the pseudoknots was also required. both the leader and the pseudoknot region were specifically recognized by, and competed for, the same proteins in extracts made from carrot cell suspension cells and wheat germ. binding of the proteins is much stronger to omega than the pseudoknot region. synergism was observed between the tmv 3' utr and the cap and to a lesser extent between omega and the 3' utr. the functional synergism and the protein binding data suggest that the cap, tmv 5' leader, and 3' utr interact to establish an efficient level of translation.
genomic structure, transcriptional control, and tissue distribution of herg1 and kcnq1 genes. the long qt syndrome gene human ether-a-go-go related gene (herg) encodes a k(+) channel critical to cardiac repolarization. it peculiarly overexpresses in cancer cells of different histogenesis and promotes tumorigenesis. to decipher the molecular mechanisms for herg overexpression, we identified and characterized the promoter region of the herg gene, which contains cis-elements for multiple oncoproteins and tumor suppressors. oncoprotein sp1 was found to be essential to driving the herg promoter thereby transcription. another oncoprotein nf-kappab transactivated, while tumor suppressor nkx3.1 repressed herg promoter activity and endogenous herg transcription. loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding cis-elements rendered a loss of the ability of the oncoproteins sp1 and nf-kappab to transactivate, and of the tumor repressor nkx3.1 to repress, herg transcription. either activation of sp1 and nf-kappab or silencing of nkx3.1 promoted tumor cell growth, and the effects were abrogated by herg inhibition or knockdown, but facilitated by overexpression of herg, indicating that herg mediates the cell growth signals generated by activation of oncoproteins or inactivation of tumor suppressors. binding of sp1, nf-kappab, and nkx3.1 to their respective cis-elements in the herg promoter in vitro and their presence on the herg promoter in vivo were confirmed. therefore, the herg promoter region is characterized by multiple sp1 binding sites that are responsible for transcription initiation of the herg gene and by binding sites for multiple other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes being important for regulating herg expression. the herg k(+) channel is likely a mediator of growth-promoting processes induced by oncoproteins and/or by silencing of tumor suppressors.
ultrabroadband infrared nanospectroscopic imaging fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy is a widely used analytical tool for chemical identification of inorganic, organic and biomedical materials, as well as for exploring conduction phenomena. because of the diffraction limit, however, conventional ftir cannot be applied for nanoscale imaging. here we demonstrate a novel ftir system that allows for infrared-spectroscopic nanoimaging of dielectric properties (nano-ftir). based on superfocusing of thermal radiation with an infrared antenna, detection of the scattered light, and strong signal enhancement employing an asymmetric ftir spectrometer, we improve the spatial resolution of conventional infrared spectroscopy by more than two orders of magnitude. by mapping a semiconductor device, we demonstrate spectroscopic identification of silicon oxides and quantification of the free-carrier concentration in doped si regions with a spatial resolution better than 100  nm. we envisage nano-ftir becoming a powerful tool for chemical identification of nanomaterials, as well as for quantitative and contact-free measurement of the local free-carrier concentration and mobility in doped nanostructures.
dairy products consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis meta-analysis often requires pooling of correlated estimates to compute regression slopes (trends) across different exposure or treatment levels. the authors propose two methods that account for the correlations but require only the summary estimates and marginal data from the studies. these methods provide more efficient estimates of regression slope, more accurate variance estimates, and more valid heterogeneity tests than those previously available. one method also allows estimation of nonlinear trend components, such as quadratic effects. the authors illustrate these methods in a meta-analysis of alcohol use and breast cancer.
differentially private maximal frequent sequence mining sequential data is being increasingly used in a variety of applications. publishing sequential data is of vital importance to the advancement of these applications. however, as shown by the re-identification attacks on the aol and netflix datasets, releasing sequential data may pose considerable threats to individual privacy. recent research has indicated the failure of existing sanitization techniques to provide claimed privacy guarantees. it is therefore urgent to respond to this failure by developing new schemes with provable privacy guarantees. differential privacy is one of the only models that can be used to provide such guarantees. due to the inherent sequentiality and high-dimensionality, it is challenging to apply differential privacy to sequential data. in this paper, we address this challenge by employing a variable-length n-gram model, which extracts the essential information of a sequential database in terms of a set of variable-length n-grams. our approach makes use of a carefully designed exploration tree structure and a set of novel techniques based on the markov assumption in order to lower the magnitude of added noise. the published n-grams are useful for many purposes. furthermore, we develop a solution for generating a synthetic database, which enables a wider spectrum of data analysis tasks. extensive experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
identification of novel diphenyl urea inhibitors of mt-guab2 active against mycobacterium tuberculosis. there is an urgent need for the discovery and development of new antitubercular agents that target novel biochemical pathways and treat drug-resistant forms of the disease. one approach to addressing this need is through high-throughput screening of drug-like small molecule libraries against the whole bacterium in order to identify a variety of new, active scaffolds that will stimulate additional biological research and drug discovery. through the molecular libraries screening center network, the niaid tuberculosis antimicrobial acquisition and coordinating facility tested a 215,110-compound library against mycobacterium tuberculosis strain h37rv. a medicinal chemistry survey of the results from the screening campaign is reported herein.
hyperphagia, not hypometabolism, causes early onset obesity in melanocortin-4 receptor knockout mice. to investigate the underlying mechanisms for leptin receptor (lepr)-mediated regulation of leptin gene (lep) expression in brown (bat) and white (wat) adipose tissue and resultant effects on plasma leptin concentrations (plasma-lep), we examined effects of sympathetic nervous system (sns) activity, caloric balance, and body fat content on leptin mrna levels in bat and wat in 10-day-old rat pups segregating for lepr(fa). in mother-reared pups, lep mrna levels were fa/fa > +/fa = +/+ in bat and was fa/fa > +/fa > +/+ in wat. the genotype effects on lep expression in bat and plasma-lep were virtually eliminated when the differences in sns activity between fa/fa and +/fa pups were equalized by artificial rearing of pups under thermoneutral conditions with or without oral norepinephrine (ne) administration. ne administration alone had little effect on the lepr(fa)-dependent stratification of lep expression in wat. bat-lep mrna was the main determinant of plasma-lep. metabolic rate, a surrogate indicator of sns activity, explained 87% of the variation in bat-lep mrna (r(2) = 0.93), whereas caloric balance (40%) and body fat mass (6%) accounted for most of the variation in wat-lep mrna (r(2) = 0.53). we conclude that feedback regulation of lep expression in bat is primarily via central nervous system-mediated effects of leptin on sns activity, whereas the control of leptin expression in wat is more likely via mechanisms not directly dependent on sns activity.
correction: an in-silico model of lipoprotein metabolism and kinetics for the evaluation of targets and biomarkers in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway our aim was to identify and quantify the major in vivo pathways of lipoprotein cholesteryl ester transport in humans. normal (n = 7), bile fistula (n = 5), and familial hypercholesterolemia (fh; n = 1) subjects were studied. each received isotopic free cholesterol in hdl, ldl, or particulate form, along with another isotope of free or esterified cholesterol or mevalonic acid. vldl, intermediate density lipoprotein (idl), ldl, hdl, blood cells, and bile were collected for up to 6 days for analysis of radioactivity and mass of free and esterified cholesterol. these raw data were subjected to compartmental analysis using the saam program. results in all groups corroborated net transport of free cholesterol to the liver from hdl, shown previously in fistula subjects. new findings revealed that 70% of ester was produced from free cholesterol in hdl and 30% from free cholesterol in ldl, idl, and vldl. no evidence was found for tissue-produced ester in plasma. there was net transfer of cholesteryl ester to vldl and idl from hdl and considerable exchange between ldl and hdl. irreversible ester output was from vldl, idl, and ldl, but very little was from hdl, suggesting that selective and holoparticle uptakes of hdl ester are minor pathways in humans. it follows that 1) they contribute little to reverse transport, 2) very high hdl would not result from defects thereof, and 3) the clinical benefit of high hdl is likely explained by other mechanisms. reverse transport in the subjects with bile fistula and fh was facilitated by ester output to the liver from vldl plus idl.
prevalence and clinical implication of double mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: revisiting the gene-dose effect 5march2015 the american college of medical genetics and genomics (acmg) previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence variants.1 in the past decade, sequencing technology has evolved rapidly with the advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. by adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. by virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. in this context the acmg convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the acmg, the association for molecular pathology (amp), and the college of american pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. the group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. this report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from acmg, amp, and college of american pathologists stakeholders. these recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. this report recommends the use of specific standard terminology—“pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely benign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified in genes that cause mendelian disorders. moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the acmg strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a clinical laboratory improvement amendments–approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.
physiological equivalent temperature as indicator for impacts of climate change on thermal comfort of humans abstract with considerably increased coverage of weather information in the news media in recent years in many countries, there is also more demand for data that are applicable and useful for everyday life. both the perception of the thermal component of weather as well as the appropriate clothing for thermal comfort result from the integral effects of all meteorological parameters relevant for heat exchange between the body and its environment. regulatory physiological processes can affect the relative importance of meteorological parameters, e.g. wind velocity becomes more important when the body is sweating. in order to take into account all these factors, it is necessary to use a heat-balance model of the human body. the physiological equivalent temperature (pet) is based on the munich energy-balance model for individuals (memi), which models the thermal conditions of the human body in a physiologically relevant way. pet is defined as the air temperature at which, in a typical indoor setting (without wind and solar radiation), the heat budget of the human body is balanced with the same core and skin temperature as under the complex outdoor conditions to be assessed. this way pet enables a layperson to compare the integral effects of complex thermal conditions outside with his or her own experience indoors. on hot summer days, for example, with direct solar irradiation the pet value may be more than 20 k higher than the air temperature, on a windy day in winter up to 15 k lower.
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (iap) antagonists demonstrate divergent immunomodulatory properties in human immune subsets with implications for combination therapy lcl161, a smac mimetic, was tested against the pptp in vitro panel (1.0 nm to 10.0 µm) and the pptp in vivo panels (30 or 75 mg/kg [solid tumors] or 100 mg/kg [all]) administered orally twice in a week. lcl161 showed a median relative ic50 value of >10 µm, being more potent against several leukemia and lymphoma lines. in vivo lcl161 induced significant differences in efs distribution in approximately one‐third of solid tumor xenografts (osteosarcoma and glioblastoma), but not in all xenografts. no objective tumor responses were observed. in vivo lcl161 demonstrated limited single agent activity against the pediatric preclinical models studied. pediatr blood cancer 2012; 58: 636–639. © 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.
molecular effects of doxorubicin on choline metabolism in breast cancer12 choline kinase is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and activated by oncogenes and mitogenic signals, making it a potential target for cancer therapy. here, we have examined, for the first time, the effects of rna interference (rnai)-mediated down-regulation of choline kinase in nonmalignant and malignant human breast epithelial cell lines using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) as well as molecular analyses of proliferation and differentiation markers. rnai knockdown of choline kinase reduced proliferation, as detected by proliferating cell nuclear antigen and ki-67 expression, and promoted differentiation, as detected by cytosolic lipid droplet formation and expression of galectin-3. the functional importance of rnai-mediated choline kinase down-regulation on choline phospholipid metabolism was confirmed by the significant reduction of phosphocholine detected by mrs. these results strongly support the targeting of choline kinase in breast cancer cells with rnai and show the potential ability of noninvasive mrs to detect and evaluate future treatments incorporating such strategies.
mapping short dna sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores. we describe an algorithm, ssaha (sequence search and alignment by hashing algorithm), for performing fast searches on databases containing multiple gigabases of dna. sequences in the database are preprocessed by breaking them into consecutive k-tuples of k contiguous bases and then using a hash table to store the position of each occurrence of each k-tuple. searching for a query sequence in the database is done by obtaining from the hash table the "hits" for each k-tuple in the query sequence and then performing a sort on the results. we discuss the effect of the tuple length k on the search speed, memory usage, and sensitivity of the algorithm and present the results of computational experiments which show that ssaha can be three to four orders of magnitude faster than blast or fasta, while requiring less memory than suffix tree methods. the ssaha algorithm is used for high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) detection and very large scale sequence assembly. also, it provides web-based sequence search facilities for ensembl projects.
two new approaches for detecting a maneuvering air target in strong sea-clutter the chirp function is one of the most fundamental functions in nature. many natural events, for example, most signals encountered in seismology and the signals in radar systems, can be modeled as the superposition of short-lived chirp functions. hence, the chirp-based signal representation, such as the gaussian chirplet decomposition, has been an active research area in the field of signal processing. a main challenge of the gaussian chirplet decomposition is that gaussian chirplets do not form an orthogonal basis. a promising solution is to employ adaptive type signal decomposition schemes, such as the matching pursuit. the general underlying theory of the matching pursuit method has been well accepted, but the numerical implementation, in terms of computational speed and accuracy, of the adaptive gaussian chirplet decomposition remains an open research topic. we present a fast refinement algorithm to search for optimal gaussian chirplets. with a coarse dictionary, the resulting adaptive gaussian chirplet decomposition is not only fast but is also more accurate than other known adaptive schemes. the effectiveness of the algorithm introduced is demonstrated by numerical simulations.
cognition and health literacy in patients with hypertension we describe the development of an abbreviated version of the test of functional health literacy in adults (tofhla) to measure patients' ability to read and understand health-related materials. the tofhla was reduced from 17 numeracy items and 3 prose passages to 4 numeracy items and 2 prose passages (s-tofhla). the maximum time for administration was reduced from 22 minutes to 12. in a group of 211 patients given the s-tofhla, cronbach's alpha was 0.68 for the 4 numeracy items and 0.97 for the 36 items in the 2 prose passages. the correlation (spearman) between the s-tofhla and the rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine (realm) was 0.80, although there were important disagreements between the two tests. the s-tofhla is a practical measure of functional health literacy with good reliability and validity that can be used by health educators to identify individuals who require special assistance to achieve learning goals.
actor–critic models of reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia: from natural to artificial rats the goal of this study was to help better understand the importance of the nucleus accumbens (nacc) in the processing of position and reward value information for goal-directed orientation behaviors. sixteen male long-evans rats, under partial water deprivation, were trained in a plus-maze to find water rewards in the respective arms which were lit in pseudo-random sequence (training trials). each day one reward arm was selected to deliver six drops of water (at 1 s intervals) the others provided only one drop per visit. after 32 visits, probe trials were intermittently presented among training trials. here, all four arms were lit and offered the previously assigned reward. the rats rapidly learned to go to the highly rewarded arm. six trained rats were given bilateral electrolytic lesions in the nacc shell, two others had unilateral lesions and eight had sham operations (with approved protocols). field potentials evoked by fornix stimulation were recorded in lesion electrodes to guide placements. only the lesioned rats showed significant impairments (p<0.05) in selecting the greater reward on probe trials. however on training trials, lesioned (and sham-operated) rats made only rare errors. while the motivation to drink and the capacity for cue-guided goal-directed orientation behavior was spared, lesioned rats were impaired in learning the location of the larger reward. the accumbens lesions apparently impaired integration of position and reward value information, consistent with anatomical and electrophysiological data showing the convergence of hippocampal, amygdalar, ventral tegmental area (vta) and prefrontal cortical inputs there.
a fusion approach to spoken language identification based on combining multiple phone recognizers and speech attribute detectors recently, the hybrid model combining deep neural network (dnn) with context-dependent hmms has achieved some dramatic gains over the conventional gmm/hmm method in many speech recognition tasks. in this paper, we study how to compete with the state-of-the-art dnn/hmm method under the traditional gmm/hmm framework. instead of using dnn as acoustic model, we use dnn as a front-end bottleneck (bn) feature extraction method to decorrelate long feature vectors concatenated from several consecutive speech frames. more importantly, we have proposed two novel incoherent training methods to explicitly de-correlate bn features in learning of dnn. the first method relies on minimizing coherence of weight matrices in dnn while the second one attempts to minimize correlation coefficients of bn features calculated in each mini-batch data in dnn training. experimental results on a 70-hr mandarin transcription task and the 309-hr switchboard task have shown that the traditional gmm/hmms using bn features can yield comparable performance as dnn/hmm. the proposed incoherent training can produce 2-3% additional gain over the baseline bn features. at last, the discriminatively trained gmm/hmms using incoherently trained bn features have consistently surpassed the state-of-the-art dnn/hmms in all evaluated tasks.
shifts from glucose to certain secondary carbon-sources result in activation of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor sigmae in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. four starvation‐inducible loci (stia, stib, stic, and stie) of salmonella typhimurium have been extensively characterized as to their genetic and physiologic regulation, and their roles in survival during prolonged simultaneous phosphate (p)‐, carbon (c)‐and nitrogen (n)‐starvation (pcn‐starvation). strains of s. typhimurium lt‐2, isogenic with the exception of lacking either the stia, stib or stic locus, died off more quickly and survived at much reduced levels compared with their wild‐type parent. when certain sti mutations were combined in the same strain, we found that viability of these cultures declined even more rapidly, and starvation‐survival was affected to leveis over‐and‐above the additive effects of each individual mutation, indicating an epistatic relationship between these loci. all four sti loci were, directly or indirectly, under negative control by the crp gene product (camp receptor protein, crp). with the exception of stib, all were similarly regulated by the cya gene product (i.e., camp). this suggests that crp acts alone, or with a signal molecule other than camp, to cause repression of the stib locus. in addition, all four loci are under positive regulation by the rela gene product (i.e., ppgpp) during c‐ or n‐starvation, but not p‐starvation. since not all rela‐depen‐dent sti loci are induced during both c‐ and n‐starvation, we propose that two separate ppgpp‐dependent pathways function during c‐starvation and n‐starvation, respectively. possible models for separate p‐, c‐and n‐starvation‐induction pathways are discussed.
how to implement monitoring tools for sedation, pain and delirium in the intensive care unit: an experimental cohort study &na; the measurement of subjective pain intensity continues to be important to both researchers and clinicians. although several scales are currently used to assess the intensity construct, it remains unclear which of these provides the most precise, replicable, and predictively valid measure. five criteria for judging intensity scales have been considered in previous research: (a) ease of administration of scoring; (b) relative rates of incorrect responding; (c) sensitivity as defined by the number of available response categories; (d) sensitivity as defined by statistical power; and (e) the magnitude of the relationship between each scale and a linear combination of pain intensity indices. in order to judge commonly used pain intensity measures, 75 chronic pain patients were asked to rate 4 kinds of pain (present, least, most, and average) using 6 scales. the utility and validity of the scales was judged using the criteria listed above. the results indicate that, for the present sample, the scales yield similar results in terms of the number of subjects who respond correctly to them and their predictive validity. however, when considering the remaining 3 criteria, the 101‐point numerical rating scale appears to be the most practical index.
clinical usefulness of pit patterns for detecting colonic lesions requiring surgical treatment in colorectal cancers, although flat and depressed-type lesions are found by regular endoscopic view, magnification and pit-pattern observation are vital parts of the precise diagnosis of the lesion. the depressed-type lesions appear to have a prominent tendency to show malignant characteristics, and the recognition and timely treatment of such lesions is important for improving the morbidity and mortality of colorectal cancer. chromoscopy is mandatory for an accurate diagnosis of these lesions. the pit-pattern classification correlates well with actual histological findings and can provide important additional information prior to endoscopic treatment of the lesion.
low-complexity variable forgetting factor techniques for rls algorithms in interference rejection applications in this paper, a new control mechanism for the variable forgetting factor (vff) of the recursive least square (rls) adaptive algorithm is presented. the control algorithm is basically a gradient-based method of which the gradient is derived from an improved mean square error analysis of rls. the new mean square error analysis exploits the correlation of the inverse of the correlation matrix with itself that yields improved theoretical results, especially in the transient and steady-state mean square error. it is shown that the theoretical analysis is close to simulation results for different forgetting factors and different model orders. the analysis yields a dynamic equation of mean square error that can be used to derive a dynamic equation of the gradient of mean square error to control the forgetting factor. the dynamic equation can produce a positive gradient when the error is large and a negative gradient when the error is in the steady state. compared with other variable forgetting factor algorithms, the new control algorithm gives fast tracking and small mean square model error for different signal-to-noise ratios (snrs).
empathy in schizophrenia: impaired resonance background several clinical and research applications require an estimation of therapeutic dose equivalence across antipsychotic medications. since the advent of the newer atypical antipsychotics, new dose equivalent estimations have been needed.   method the reported minimum effective dose was identified for each newer atypical antipsychotic medication and for haloperidol across all available fixed-dose placebo-controlled studies. reported minimum effective dose equivalence ratios to haloperidol were then converted to chlorpromazine equivalents using the "2 mg of haloperidol equals 100 mg of chlorpromazine" convention.   data sources and study selection to identify the fixed-dose studies, the following sources were searched until june 2002: medline, the bibliographies of identified reports, published meta-analyses and reviews, cochrane reviews, freedom of information act material available from the food and drug administration, and abstracts from several scientific meetings from 1997 to 2002.   results doses equivalent to 100 mg/day of chlorpromazine were 2 mg/day for risperidone, 5 mg/day for olanzapine, 75 mg/day for quetiapine, 60 mg/day for ziprasidone, and 7.5 mg/day for aripiprazole.   conclusion these equivalency estimates may be useful for clinical and research purposes. the source of the dose equivalency estimation is evidence-based and consistent across medication.
microtubule-associated proteins map65-1 and map65-2 positively regulate axial cell growth in etiolated arabidopsis hypocotyls[w] microtubules (mts) are highly dynamic polymers that serve as tracks for vesicular movement during interphase and as structural components of the mitotic spindle, which is used to segregate the genetic material. mt dynamics are highly regulated wherein mts turnover differentially between interphase and mitosis. within the mitotic spindle, there are distinct classes of mts with different dynamic properties. to understand how cellular proteins regulate the dynamics of mts, it is necessary to have methods to assess their turnover properties. in this chapter we present approaches to assess mt dynamics in cultured mammalian cells using fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching. we include a discussion of cell culture and imaging conditions that maintain cell viability. we also provide an extensive discussion of both data collection and analysis that are utilized to estimate the turnover dynamics of mts.
respiratory impedances and acinar gas transfer in a canine model for emphysema. we calculated respiratory system resistance (rrs) and elastance (ers) from pressure and flow at the mouth in six seated subjects relaxed at frc (cheeks tightly compressed) during sinusoidal volume forcing (250, 500, and 750 ml) at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 hz. dependencies of rrs and ers on frequency and tidal volume were generally the same in each subject; rrs tended to decrease with frequency and tidal volume, whereas ers tended to increase with frequency and decrease with tidal volume. multiple linear regression of combined data indicated that the frequency and tidal volume effects on rrs and ers were significant (p less than 0.05), and that the effects on rrs decreased at higher flows. average rrs was highest (4.43 cm h2o/l/s +/- 0.21 se) at 0.2 hz-250 ml, and lowest (3.07 cm h2o/l/s +/- 0.37) at 0.6 hz-750 ml. average ers was highest (12.1 cm h2o/l +/- 1.1) at 0.6 hz-250 ml, and lowest (7.1 cm h2o/l +/- 0.6) at 0.2 hz-750 ml. we conclude that frequency and tidal volume dependencies in rrs and ers in the normal range of breathing should be considered when interpreting measurements of respiratory system impedance or developing models to describe the mechanical behavior of the respiratory system.
modelling bacterial behaviour close to a no-slip plane boundary: the influence of bacterial geometry this textbook on parallel scientific computing presents state-of-the-art material in scientific algorithm design for modem parallel computers. the first volume of this textbook (published in 1986) described the art of scientific computing in fortran 77 on single-processor syslg, tems. the first edition of the second volume was published in 1996. in the current second edition, all codes have been corrected according to version 2.06 of fortran 90. volume 2 deals with fortran 90 compilers, which are now widely available, and is devoted to parallel scientific computing. the book, written with support of the us national science foundation, can be very useful for graduate and postgraduate courses and also for all specialists who are interested in parallel scientific computing. it's well known that fortran is excellent for scientific computing. but in scientific computing, multiprocessor systems are widely used now, instead of single-processor systems. thus, the actual problem is to modify wellknown recipes according to parallel-programming ideas. this book has successfully solved this problem. first, the authors introduce fortran 90, parallel programming, and parallel utility functions for fortran 90. these functions include the move data, returning a location, argument checking and error handling, outer operations on vectors, scatter with combine, skew operations on matrices, polynomials, and recurrences routines. next, the authors consider the most popular scientific numerical algorithms previously coded in fortran 77 and present new codes elaborated by fortran 90 with parallel facilities. they discuss the solution of linear algebra equations, interpolation and extrapolation problems, integration and evaluation of functions, computing of special functions and random numbers, sorting, solution of nonlinear sets of equation and eigenvalue problems, minimization and maximization of functions, fourier transformation, statistical algorithms, integration of ode and pde, and less-numerical algorithms. by studying the presented fortran 90 parallel codes, readers can get good experience in fortran 90 and in parallel programming. t o read this book, you only need basic skills in numerical methods and in fortran programming. thus, it is an excellent practical guide in modern parallel scientific programming, and it can be used for self-instruction. unfortunately, the mathematical background of all the algorithms described in the book are only presented in volume 1. therefore, to properly study all the routines, the reader must have volume 1. the book's reference list is not large and contains only about 40 examples of fortran textbooks, well-known textbooks on numerical methods, and a few books dedicated to parallel programming directly connected with the book's subject. all 3 so routines considered in the book are available on diskettes or cd rom for ibm pc, macintosh, and unix computers. readers can purchase this software by mail.
patterns of federated identity management systems as architectural reconfigurations we introduce architectural design rewriting (adr), an  approach to deal with the design of reconfigurable software  architectures. the key features we promote are:  (i) rule-based approach (over graphs);  (ii) hierarchical design;  (iii) algebraic presentation; and  (iv) inductively-defined reconfigurations.  architectures are suitably modeled by graphs whose edges and nodes respectively represent components and connection ports.  architectures are designed hierarchically by a set  of edge replacement rules that fix the architectural style.  depending on their reading, productions allow:  (i) top-down design by refinement,  (ii) bottom-up typing of actual architectures, and  (iii) well-formed composition of architectures.  the key idea is to encode style proofs as terms and to exploit such  information at run-time for guiding reconfigurations.  the main advantages of adr are that: (i) instead of reasoning on flat  architectures, adr specifications provide a convenient hierarchical  structure, by exploiting the architectural classes introduced by the style,  (ii) complex reconfiguration schemes can be defined inductively, and (iii)  style-preservation is guaranteed.
front-face fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to classify seven bovine muscles according to their chemical and rheological characteristics. this paper reports the potential of synchronous front-face fluorescence spectroscopy in the characterization at the molecular level of milk changes during mild heating from 4 to 50 °c and acidification in the ph range of 6.8 to 5.1. synchronous fluorescence spectra were collected in the 250–550 nm excitation wavelength range using offsets of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, and 240 nm between excitation and emission monochromators. the potential of parallel factor (parafac) analysis in the decomposition of the whole synchronous fluorescence data set into the contribution of each of the fluorescent compounds present in milk has been investigated for heating and acidification data sets. models were fitted from 1 to 7 components. considering the core consistency values, parafac models with three components have been considered. the first three components explained 94.43% and 94.13% of the total variance for heating and acidification data sets, respectively. the loading profiles of the first and second components derived from parafac analysis performed on heating and acidification data sets corresponded quite well with the characteristics of tryptophan and vitamin a fluorescence spectra, respectively. the third component corresponded to the riboflavin fluorescence spectrum. considering the heating experiment, the profile of the concentration mode for the second component showed large variations according to the temperature, which were assigned to the melting of triglycerides between 4 and 50 °c. for the acidification experiment, drastic changes in the concentration modes of the three components were observed for ph below 5.6, in agreement with structural changes in casein micelles.
remediation of waterways in agricultural settings using organic mulch the antimicrobial activity of manuka honey has been well documented (molan, 1992a,b,c, 1997) [molan, p.c., 1992. the antibacterial activity of honey. 1: the nature of the antibacterial activity. bee world 73 (1) 5-28; molan, p.c., 1992. the antibacterial activity of honey. 2: variation in the potency of the antibacterial activity. bee world 73 (2) 59-76; molan, p.c., 1992. medicinal uses for honey. beekeepers quarterly 26; molan, p.c., 1997. finding new zealand honeys with outstanding antibacterial and antifungal activity. new zealand beekeeper 4 (10) 20-26]. the current bioassays for determining this antimicrobial effect employ a well diffusion (ahn and stiles, 1990) [ahn, c., stiles, m.e., 1990. antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from vacuum-packed meats. journal of applied bacteriology 69, 302-310], (weston et al., 1999) [weston, r.j., mitchell, k.r., allen, k.l., 1999. antibacterial phenolic components of new zealand manuka honey. j. food chem. 64, 295-301] or disc diffusion (taormina et al., 2001) [taormina, peter j., niemira, brendan a., beuchat, larry r., 2001. inhibitory activity of honey against food borne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power. int. j. food microbiol. 69, 217-225] assay using zones of inhibition as indicators of bacterial susceptibility. the development of a 24-h spectrophotometric assay employing 96-well microtiter plates, that is more sensitive and more amenable to statistical analysis than the assays currently employed, was undertaken. this simple and rapid assay permits extensive kinetic studies even in the presence of low honey concentrations, and is capable of detecting inhibitory levels below those recorded for well or disc diffusion assays. in this paper, we compare the assay to both well and disc diffusion assays. the results we obtained for the spectrophotometric method mic values show that this method has greater sensitivity than the standard well and disc diffusion assays. in addition, inter- and intra-assay variance for this method was investigated, demonstrating the methods reproducibility and repeatability.
altered default-mode network activation in mild cognitive impairment compared with healthy aging abstract the need for a simply applied quantitative assessment of handedness is discussed and some previous forms reviewed. an inventory of 20 items with a set of instructions and response- and computational-conventions is proposed and the results obtained from a young adult population numbering some 1100 individuals are reported. the separate items are examined from the point of view of sex, cultural and socio-economic factors which might appertain to them and also of their inter-relationship to each other and to the measure computed from them all. criteria derived from these considerations are then applied to eliminate 10 of the original 20 items and the results recomputed to provide frequency-distribution and cumulative frequency functions and a revised item-analysis. the difference of incidence of handedness between the sexes is discussed.
nonunified integral imaging elemental image array generation method based on selective pixel sampling algorithm. in this paper, we propose a tilted elemental image array generation method for computer generated integral imaging display with reduced moiré patterns. the pixels of the tilted elemental image array are divided into border pixels and effective pixels. according to the optimal tilted angle, the effective pixels are arranged with uniform arrangement. also, a pixel mapping method is proposed. appropriate experiments are carried out and the experimental results show that not only the color moiré patterns are reduced remarkably, but also the resolution of the reconstructed 3d images are improved through the proposed method.
genomic analysis of the appearance of testicular oocytes in mrl/mpj mice from scandinavia to the black sea there is a narrow zone of hybrid populations where the western european (mus domesticus) and eastern european (mus musculus) house mouse species meet (see figs. 1 and 3 in sage et al. 1993). the clines for sex chromosomes were found to be appreciably steeper than those for most autosomal loci and mitochondrial dna (mtdna) wherever they have been assessed (vanlerberghe et al. 1986, 1988a, 1988b; tucker et al. 1992; orth et al. 1996; refs. therein; r.d. sage and e.m. prager, unpublished). explanations involving disruption of coadapted gene complexes (hybrid breakdown) and an important role for sex chromosomes in mus speciation have been put forth (for example, vanlerberghe et al. 1986; tucker et al. 1992). in northern denmark, sweden, finland, and east holstein (eastern schleswig-holstein in northern germany), unlike elsewhere, mtdnas from a single species are found within and on both sides of the hybrid zone owing to complete introgression of m. domesticus mtdna into the m. musculus populations. further, in east holstein, which is the apparent staging ground for house mouse colonization of scandinavia, high proportions of mice on both sides of the hybrid zone carry the same types of closely related mtdnas (prager et al. 1993). to test the possibility that the nature of the cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) genome could influence the extent of sex chromosomal introgression, we have now determined the y chromosome (chr) variation across the east holstein transect. tanooka and associates (1995) and ohtsuka and colleagues (1996) have recently found a processed p53 pseudogene (wp53) on chr 17 to be a variable marker in mus. though there is variation with respect to the presence and absence of this q~p53 among commensal house mice collectively (tanooka et al. 1995; ohtsuka et al. 1996; e.m. prager and r.d. sage, unpublished), in the european portion of their range this marker is present in m. domesticus and absent in m. musculus (see also below). we therefore determined the frequency of the wp53 allele across the east holstein transect, so as to compare the cline for a nonfunctional gene and a locus on an additional chromosome with previous results for functional autosomal loci (prager et al. 1993). to study y chr and q~p53 variation via the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), we developed three pairs of primers that (1) amplify specific portions of the genome (89-167 bp between primers), (2) provide a positive control for amplification by yielding products regardless of which variant state is present, and (3) yield fragments short enough (137-215 bp) that they can be used to assess nuclear genotypes with dna retrieved from museum skins,
job sharing in the endomembrane system: vacuolar acidification requires the combined activity of v-atpase and v-ppase there is a growing demand for methods that allow rapid and reliable in situ localization of proteins in plant cells. the immunocytochemistry protocol presented here can be used routinely to observe protein localization patterns in tissue sections of various plant species. this protocol is especially suitable for plant species with more-complex tissue architecture (such as maize, zea mays), which makes it difficult to use an easier whole-mount procedure for protein localization. to facilitate the antibody-antigen reaction, it is necessary to include a wax-embedding and tissue-sectioning step. the protocol consists of the following procedures: chemical fixation of tissue, dehydration, wax embedding, sectioning, dewaxing, rehydration, blocking and antibody incubation. the detailed protocol, recommended controls and troubleshooting are presented here, along with examples of applications.

perceptual decisions formed by accumulation of audiovisual evidence in prefrontal cortex electrophysiological studies in nonhuman primates and other mammals have shown that sensory cues from different modalities that appear at the same time and in the same location can increase the firing rate of multisensory cells in the superior colliculus to a level exceeding that predicted by summing the responses to the unimodal inputs. in contrast, spatially disparate multisensory cues can induce a profound response depression. we have previously demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) that similar indices of crossmodal facilitation and inhibition are detectable in human cortex when subjects listen to speech while viewing visually congruent and incongruent lip and mouth movements. here, we have used fmri to investigate whether similar bold signal changes are observable during the crossmodal integration of nonspeech auditory and visual stimuli, matched or mismatched solely on the basis of their temporal synchrony, and if so, whether these crossmodal effects occur in similar brain areas as those identified during the integration of audio-visual speech. subjects were exposed to synchronous and asynchronous auditory (white noise bursts) and visual (b/w alternating checkerboard) stimuli and to each modality in isolation. synchronous and asynchronous bimodal inputs produced superadditive bold response enhancement and response depression across a large network of polysensory areas. the most highly significant of these crossmodal gains and decrements were observed in the superior colliculi. other regions exhibiting these crossmodal interactions included cortex within the superior temporal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, insula, and several foci in the frontal lobe, including within the superior and ventromedial frontal gyri. these data demonstrate the efficacy of using an analytic approach informed by electrophysiology to identify multisensory integration sites in humans and suggest that the particular network of brain areas implicated in these crossmodal integrative processes are dependent on the nature of the correspondence between the different sensory inputs (e.g. space, time, and/or form).
neural acceleration for gpu throughput processors this paper introduces mcpat, an integrated power, area, and timing modeling framework that supports comprehensive design space exploration for multicore and manycore processor configurations ranging from 90nm to 22nm and beyond. at the microarchitectural level, mcpat includes models for the fundamental components of a chip multiprocessor, including in-order and out-of-order processor cores, networks-on-chip, shared caches, integrated memory controllers, and multiple-domain clocking. at the circuit and technology levels, mcpat supports critical-path timing modeling, area modeling, and dynamic, short-circuit, and leakage power modeling for each of the device types forecast in the itrs roadmap including bulk cmos, soi, and double-gate transistors. mcpat has a flexible xml interface to facilitate its use with many performance simulators. combined with a performance simulator, mcpat enables architects to consistently quantify the cost of new ideas and assess tradeoffs of different architectures using new metrics like energy-delay-area2 product (eda2p) and energy-delay-area product (edap). this paper explores the interconnect options of future manycore processors by varying the degree of clustering over generations of process technologies. clustering will bring interesting tradeoffs between area and performance because the interconnects needed to group cores into clusters incur area overhead, but many applications can make good use of them due to synergies of cache sharing. combining power, area, and timing results of mcpat with performance simulation of parsec benchmarks at the 22nm technology node for both common in-order and out-of-order manycore designs shows that when die cost is not taken into account clustering 8 cores together gives the best energy-delay product, whereas when cost is taken into account configuring clusters with 4 cores gives the best eda2p and edap.
neural network-based abstract generation for opinions and arguments human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused. we propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. we present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.
a comparative study between different pain rating scales in patients of osteoarthritis. aims and objectives this review aims to explore the research available relating to three commonly used pain rating scales, the visual analogue scale, the verbal rating scale and the numerical rating scale. the review provides information needed to understand the main properties of the scales.   background data generated from pain-rating scales can be easily misunderstood. this review can help clinicians to understand the main features of these tools and thus use them effectively.   method a medline review via pubmed was carried out with no restriction of age of papers retrieved. papers were examined for methodological soundness before being included. the search terms initially included pain rating scales, pain measurement, visual analogue scale, vas, verbal rating scale, vrs, numerical/numeric rating scale, nrs. the reference lists of retrieved articles were used to generate more papers and search terms. only english language papers were examined.   conclusions all three pain-rating scales are valid, reliable and appropriate for use in clinical practice, although the visual analogue scale has more practical difficulties than the verbal rating scale or the numerical rating scale. for general purposes the numerical rating scale has good sensitivity and generates data that can be statistically analysed for audit purposes. patients who seek a sensitive pain-rating scale would probably choose this one. for simplicity patients prefer the verbal rating scale, but it lacks sensitivity and the data it produces can be misunderstood.   relevance to clinical practice in order to use pain-rating scales well clinicians need to appreciate the potential for error within the tools, and the potential they have to provide the required information. interpretation of the data from a pain-rating scale is not as straightforward as it might first appear.
demand forecasting by temporal aggregation: using optimal or multiple aggregation levels? intermittent demand patterns are characterised by infrequent demand arrivals coupled with variable demand sizes. such patterns prevail in many industrial applications, including it, automotive, aerospace and military. an intuitively appealing strategy to deal with such patterns from a forecasting perspective is to aggregate demand in lower-frequency ‘time buckets’ thereby reducing the presence of zero observations. however, such aggregation may result in losing useful information, as the frequency of observations is reduced. in this paper, we explore the effects of aggregation by investigating 5000 stock keeping units from the royal air force (uk). we are also concerned with the empirical determination of an optimum aggregation level as well as the effects of aggregating demand in time buckets that equal the lead-time length (plus review period). this part of the analysis is of direct relevance to a (periodic) inventory management setting where such cumulative lead-time demand estimates are required. our study allows insights to be gained into the value of aggregation in an intermittent demand context. the paper concludes with an agenda for further research.
automaton meets algebra: a hybrid paradigm for xml stream processing while standardization efforts for xml query languages have been progressing, researchers and users increasingly focus on the database technology that has to deliver on the new challenges that the abundance of xml documents poses to data management: validation, performance evaluation and optimization of xml query processors are the upcoming issues. following a long tradition in database research, we provide a framework to assess the abilities of an xml database to cope with a broad range of different query types typically encountered in real-world scenarios. the benchmark can help both implementors and users to compare xml databases in a standardized application scenario. to this end, we offer a set of queries where each query is intended to challenge a particular aspect of the query processor. the overall workload we propose consists of a scalable document database and a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries which covers the major aspects of xml query processing ranging from textual features to data analysis queries and ad hoc queries. we complement our research with results we obtained from running the benchmark on several xml database platforms. these results are intended to give a first baseline and illustrate the state of the art.
role of renal nerves in stimulation of renin, cox-2, and nnos in rat renal cortex during salt deficiency. this study sought to examine the involvement of prostaglandins and of nitric oxide (no) in the macula densa-dependent activation of the renin system in vivo. for this purpose, male sprague-dawley rats were chronically infused with furosemide (12 mg/day) for 6 days to inhibit macula densa salt transport. to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and of no, animals were injected with indomethacin (2 mg/kg twice daily) and with nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name; 40 mg/kg twice daily) for the last 2 days of the experiment, respectively. furosemide infusion increased plasma renin activity (pra) from 8.8 +/- 1.4 to 41 +/- 5.2 ng angiotensin i (ang i).h-1.ml-1 and renin mrna levels from 112 +/- 8 of standard to 249 +/- 18% of standard. after treatment with indomethacin, the furosemide-induced increases in renin mrna levels was attenuated to 190 +/- 11% of standard. after injections of l-name, both the furosemide-induced increases of renin mrna levels and of pra were reduced to 126 +/- 14% of standard and 22 +/- 5 ng ang i.h-1.ml-1, respectively. these findings suggest that activation of renin gene expression by blockade of the macula densa function is dependent on intact no and prostaglandin formation, whereas for stimulation of renin secretion mainly intact no formation appears to be necessary.
a regularized compression method to unsupervised word segmentation several results in the word segmentation literature suggest that description length provides a useful estimate of segmentation quality in fully unsupervised settings. however, since the space of potential segmentations grows exponentially with the length of the corpus, no tractable algorithm follows directly from the minimum description length (mdl) principle. therefore, it is necessary to generate a set of candidate segmentations and select between them according to the mdl principle. we evaluate several algorithms for generating these candidate segmentations on a range of natural language corpora, and show that the bootstrapped voting experts algorithm consistently outperforms other methods when paired with mdl.

model-driven test case design for model-to-model semantics preservation uppaal is a tool suite for automatic verification of safety and bounded liveness properties of real-time systems modeled as networks of timed automata. it includes: a graphical interface that supports graphical and textual representations of networks of timed automata, and automatic transformation from graphical representations to textual format, a compiler that transforms a certain class of linear hybrid systems to networks of timed automata, and a model-checker which is implemented based on constraint-solving techniques. uppaal also supports diagnostic model-checking providing diagnostic information in case verification of a particular real-time systems fails.
fetal electrocardiogram extraction and analysis using adaptive noise cancellation and wavelet transformation techniques abstract achievement of good reconstruction performance by most of existing greedy algorithms is possible only when signal sparsity has been known well in advance. however, it is difficult in practice to ensure signal sparsity making the reconstruction performance of the greedy algorithms stable. moreover, some greedy algorithms with previous unknown signal sparsity are time-consuming in the process of adaptive adjustment of signal sparsity, and thereby making the reconstruction time too long. to address these concerns, the greedy algorithm from signal sparsity estimation proposed in this paper. based on the restricted isometry property criterion, signal sparsity is estimated before atoms selection and the step size of atoms selection adjusted adaptively based on the relations between of the signal residuals in each iteration. the research which solves the problem of sparsity estimation in the greedy algorithm provides the compressed sensing available to the applications where the signal sparsity is un-known. it has important academic and practical values. experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the performance of proposed algorithm to the greedy algorithms with previous unknown signal sparsity, no matter on the performance stability and reconstruction precision.
association of the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance protein 1 (bcar1) and bcar3 scaffolding proteins in cell signaling and antiestrogen resistance* the adapter molecule p130cas (cas) plays a role in cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, cell adhesion, and migration. the ability of cas to promote migration has been shown to be dependent upon its carboxyl terminus, which contains a bipartite binding site for the protein tyrosine kinase c-src (src). the association between src and cas enhances src kinase activity, and like cas, src plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration. in this study, we show that src and cas function cooperatively to promote cell migration in a manner that depends upon kinase-active src. another carboxyl-terminal binding partner of cas, and-34/bcar3 (and-34), functions synergistically with cas to enhance src activation and cell migration. the carboxyl-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of and-34, as well as the activity of its putative target rap1, contribute to these events. a mechanism through which and-34 may regulate cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by the finding that cas becomes redistributed from focal adhesions to lamellipodia located at the leading edge of and-34 overexpressing cells. these data thus provide insight into how cas and and-34 may function together to stimulate src signaling pathways and promote cell migration.
increased cytosolic free mg2+and ca2+ in platelets of patients with vasospastic angina. there is controversy as to whether platelet intracellular free calcium ([ca2+]i) is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) as compared with wistar-kyoto (wky) rats. discrepant results may be due to methodological problems including platelet activation during the collection process and leakage of intracellular dye used for [ca2+]i measurement. to provide further insight into this problem, [ca2+]i was estimated in fura-2-loaded platelets isolated from eight shr and seven wky rats at 12-14 weeks of age by using a two-syringe blood collection method and a correction method for fura-2 leakage. basal [ca2+]i was higher in shr than in wky rats (61.6 +/- 5.6 vs. 54.0 +/- 3.9 nm, p less than 0.02). however, the difference disappeared when a correction for fura-2 leakage was not used (109.7 +/- 18.4 vs. 94.9 +/- 9.2 nm, p less than 0.1). thus, differences in [ca2+]i between shr and wky rats may be obscured if dye leakage from platelets is not taken into account. thrombin (0.1 units/ml) induced a rise in [ca2+]i that was greater in shr than wky rats, both in the presence (491.4 +/- 31.6 vs. 377.5 +/- 21.7 nm, p less than 0.002) and absence (264.9 +/- 33.6 vs. 228.2 +/- 30.1 nm, p less than 0.05) of calcium in the media. these results indicate that thrombin-stimulated calcium influx as well as discharge of calcium from intracellular stores is increased in shr platelets. thus, under both basal and stimulated conditions, platelet calcium handling is abnormal in the shr.
secure semantic web data management: confidentiality, integrity, and compliant availability in open and distributed networks computational ontologies in the context of information systems are artifacts that encode a description of some world, for some purpose. under the assumption that there exist classes of problems that can be solved by applying common solutions (as it has been experienced in software engineering), we envision small, task-oriented ontologies with explicit documentation of design rationales. in this chapter, we describe components called ontology design patterns (op), and methods that support pattern-based ontology design.
consensus genes of the literature to predict breast cancer recurrence as vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display becomes critical. a mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided at http://genome.ucsc.edu. this browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mrna and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. one-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the university of california, santa cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. the conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying mysql database, and overall use are described. the web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000 different users.
gurls: a toolbox for regularized least squares learning biological visual systems are currently unrivaled by artificial systems in their ability to recognize faces and objects in highly variable and cluttered real-world environments. biologically-inspired computer vision systems seek to capture key aspects of the computational architecture of the brain, and such approaches have proven successful across a range of standard object and face recognition tasks (e.g. [23, 8, 9, 18]). here, we explore the effectiveness of these algorithms on a large-scale unconstrained real-world face recognition problem based on images taken from the face-book social networking website. in particular, we use a family of biologically-inspired models derived from a high-throughput feature search paradigm [19, 15] to tackle a face identification task with up to one hundred individuals (a number that approaches the reasonable size of real-world social networks). we show that these models yield high levels of face-identification performance even when large numbers of individuals are considered; this performance increases steadily as more examples are used, and the models outperform a state-of-the-art commercial face recognition system. finally, we discuss current limitations and future opportunities associated with datasets such as these, and we argue that careful creation of large sets is an important future direction.
effect of work and recovery duration on skeletal muscle oxygenation and fuel use during sustained intermittent exercise abstract in this study we compared substrate oxidation and muscle oxygen availability during sustained intermittent intense and continuous submaximal exercise with similar overall (i.e. work and recovery) oxygen consumption (v˙o2). physically active subjects (n = 7) completed 90 min of an intermittent intense (12 s work:18 s recovery) and a continuous submaximal treadmill running protocol on separate days. in another experiment (n = 5) we compared oxygen availability in the vastus lateralis muscle between these two exercise protocols using near-infrared spectroscopy. initially, overall v˙o2 (i.e. work and recovery) was matched, and from 37.5 min to 67.5 min of exercise was similar, although slightly higher during continuous exercise (8%; p < 0.05). energy expenditure was constant (22.5–90 min of exercise) and was not different in intermittent intense [0.81 (0.01) kj · min−1 · kg−1] and continuous submaximal [0.85 (0.01) kj · min−1 · kg−1] exercise. overall exercise intensity, represented as a proportion of peak aerobic power (v˙o2peak), was 68.1 (2.5)% v˙o2peak and 71.8 (1.8)% v˙o2peak for intermittent and continuous exercise protocols, respectively. fat oxidation was almost 3 times lower (p < 0.05) and carbohydrate oxidation was approximately 1.2 times higher (p < 0.05) during intermittent compared to continuous exercise, despite the same overall energy expenditure. capillary plasma lactate was constant from 15 to 90 min of exercise, and pyruvate was constant from 15 to 75 min, although both were higher (p < 0.0001, lactate; p < 0.001, pyruvate) during intermittent [5.05 (0.28) mm, 200 (7) μm, respectively] compared to continuous exercise [2.41 (0.10) mm, 114 (4) μm, respectively]. there was no difference between protocols for either plasma glycerol or non-esterified fatty acids. the decrease in muscle oxygenation during work periods of intermittent exercise resulted in a lower nadir oxygenation [54.62 (0.41)%] compared to continuous exercise [58.82 (0.21)%, p < 0.001]. the decline in oxygenation was correlated with treadmill speed (r = 0.72; p < 0.05). these results show a difference in substrate utilisation and muscle oxygen availability during sustained intermittent intense and continuous submaximal exercise, despite a similar overall v˙o2 and identical energy expenditure.
effects of ankle dorsiflexion on range and reliability of straight leg raising. the purpose of this study was to analyze the straight-leg-raising (slr) maneuver while the ankle was fixed in dorsiflexion or relaxed in plantar flexion. twenty-two healthy subjects underwent active and passive slr with the ankle in each position. we used cinematography to document movement of the right lower limb and pelvis and electromyography to document hamstring muscle activity. analyses of variance of the angles of maximum slr and change in the pelvic position showed a significant f ratio (p = .01) among the active and passive trials. post hoc analyses demonstrated significant differences (p = .01) between slr with dorsiflexion and slr with plantar flexion. the emg activity among trials was not significantly different. the possible causes of the effects of dorsiflexion on slr are discussed. we encourage clinicians to document and compare slr with dorsiflexion and slr with plantar flexion, and we recommend additional research to examine the relative influence of tissue structures on slr.
early blood glucose profile and neurodevelopmental outcome at two years in neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy aims: to examine the predictive value of early developmental testing for identifying neuromotor and perceptual-motor impairment at school age in children with neonatal encephalopathy (ne). methods: eighty full term infants with ne were followed longitudinally. where possible, children were tested on the griffiths scales at 1 and 2 years and at 5–6 years, on the touwen examination, movement abc, and wppsi. the relation between the griffiths scores and later outcome measures was examined using correlation coefficients and sensitivity and specificity values. results: by 2 years, 25 children with cerebral palsy were too severely impaired to be formally assessed and remained so at 5–6 years. abnormal griffiths scores were obtained by 12% and 7% of the children at 1 and 2 years respectively. at 5–6 years, 33% had poor movement abc scores and 15% poor wppsi scores. the highest correlation between griffiths scores and the outcome measures was for the movement abc (0.72), although this accounted for only 50% of the variance. sensitivity scores for the movement abc were below 70% but specificity was 100%. conclusions: a poor score on the griffiths scales at 1 and/or 2 years is a good predictor of impairment at school age. however, a normal score in the early years cannot preclude later neurological, perceptual-motor, or cognitive abnormalities.
fatty acids acutely enhance insulin-induced oxidative stress and cause insulin resistance by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ros) generation and nuclear factor-κb inhibitor (iκb)–nuclear factor-κb (nfκb) activation in rat muscle, in the absence of mitochondrial dysfunction we previously showed that insulin has a profound effect to suppress pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (pdk) 4 expression in rat skeletal muscle. in the present study, we examined whether insulin’s effect on pdk4 expression is impaired in acute insulin-resistant states and, if so, whether this change is accompanied by decreased insulin’s effects to stimulate akt and forkhead box class o (foxo) 1 phosphorylation. to induce insulin resistance, conscious overnight-fasted rats received a constant infusion of intralipid or lactate for 5 h, while a control group received saline infusion. following the initial infusions, each group received saline or insulin infusion (n = 6 or 7 each) for an additional 5 h, while saline, intralipid, or lactate infusion was continued. plasma glucose was clamped at basal levels during the insulin infusion. compared with the control group, intralipid and lactate infusions decreased glucose infusion rates required to clamp plasma glucose by ∼60% (p < 0.01), confirming the induction of insulin resistance. insulin’s ability to suppress pdk4 mrna level was impaired in skeletal muscle with intralipid and lactate infusions, resulting in two- to threefold higher pdk4 mrna levels with insulin (p < 0.05). insulin stimulation of akt and foxo1 phosphorylation was also significantly decreased with intralipid and lactate infusions. these data suggest that insulin’s effect to suppress pdk4 gene expression in skeletal muscle is impaired in insulin-resistant states, and this may be due to impaired insulin signaling for stimulation of akt and foxo1 phosphorylation. impaired insulin’s effect to suppress pdk4 expression may explain the association between pdk4 overexpression and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
the role of mtor signaling in the regulation of protein synthesis and muscle mass during immobilization in mice non‐technical summary  chronic mechanical loading (cml) of skeletal muscle induces growth and this effect can be blocked by the drug rapamycin. rapamycin is considered to be a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), and thus, many have concluded that mtor plays a key role in cml‐induced growth. however, direct evidence that mtor confers the cml‐induced activation of growth promoting events such as hypertrophy, hyperplasia and ribosome biogenesis is lacking. this study addressed that gap in knowledge by using a specialized line of transgenic mice. surprisingly, the results indicate that only a few of the growth promoting events induced by cml are fully dependent on mtor signalling (e.g. hypertrophy). these results advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass and should help future studies aimed at identifying targets for therapies that can prevent the loss of muscle mass during conditions such as bedrest, immobilization, and ageing.
celljoin: a parallel stream join operator for the cell processor we present an adaptive load shedding approach for windowed stream joins. in contrast to the conventional approach of dropping tuples from the input streams, we explore the concept ofselective processing for load shedding. we allow stream tuples to be stored in the windows and shed excessive cpu load by performing the join operations, not on the entire set of tuples within the windows, but on a dynamically changing subset of tuples that are learned to be highly beneficial. we support such dynamic selective processing through three forms of runtimeadaptations: adaptation to input stream rates, adaptation to time correlation between the streams and adaptation to join directions. our load shedding approach enables us to integrateutility-based load shedding withtime correlation-based load shedding. indexes are used to further speed up the execution of stream joins. experiments are conducted to evaluate our adaptive load shedding in terms of output rate and utility. the results show that our selective processing approach to load shedding is very effective and significantly outperforms the approach that drops tuples from the input streams.
clinical characteristics of elderly patients with a cautious gait of unknown origin a new geriatric depression scale (gds) designed specifically for rating depression in the elderly was tested for reliability and validity and compared with the hamilton rating scale for depression (hrs-d) and the zung self-rating depression scale (sds). in constructing the gds a 100-item questionnaire was administered to normal and severely depressed subjects. the 30 questions most highly correlated with the total scores were then selected and readministered to new groups of elderly subjects. these subjects were classified as normal, mildly depressed or severely depressed on the basis of research diagnostic criteria (rdc) for depression. the gds, hrs-d and sds were all found to be internally consistent measures, and each of the scales was correlated with the subject's number of rdc symptoms. however, the gds and the hrs-d were significantly better correlated with rdc symptoms than was the sds. the authors suggest that the gds represents a reliable and valid self-rating depression screening scale for elderly populations.
in vivo rna interference screens identify regulators of antiviral cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cell differentiation. t follicular helper cell differentiation when b cells respond to an infection, they often require help from cd4+ t cells to mount a proper response. it is thought that a subset of cd4+ effector t cells, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), performs this function. several subsets of effector cd4+ t cells arise, depending on the type of infection, which have distinct transcriptional programs driving their differentiation. whether this is also the case for tfh cells has not been clear (see the perspective by awasthi and kuchroo). nurieva et al. (p. 1001, published online 23 july) and johnston et al. (p. 1006; published online 16 july) now demonstrate that the transcription factor bcl6 is both necessary and sufficient for tfh differentiation and subsequent b cell–mediated immunity, suggesting that it is a master regulator of this lineage. johnston et al. also show that expression of bcl6 and the transcription factor, blimp-1, are reciprocally regulated in tfh cells and that, when ectopically expressed, blimp-1 inhibits tfh development. the transcription factors that regulate follicular t helper cell differentiation are identified. effective b cell–mediated immunity and antibody responses often require help from cd4+ t cells. it is thought that a distinct cd4+ effector t cell subset, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), provides this help; however, the molecular requirements for tfh differentiation are unknown. we found that expression of the transcription factor bcl6 in cd4+ t cells is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo tfh differentiation and t cell help to b cells in mice. in contrast, the transcription factor blimp-1, an antagonist of bcl6, inhibits tfh differentiation and help, thereby preventing b cell germinal center and antibody responses. these findings demonstrate that tfh cells are required for proper b cell responses in vivo and that bcl6 and blimp-1 play central but opposing roles in tfh differentiation.
food group intake and the risk of oral epithelial dysplasia in a united states population oral epithelial dysplasia (oed) is a histopathological diagnosis that is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. the purpose of this case-control study was to measure the association between oed and the use of smoking tobacco and alcoholic beverages. incident cases of oed (n = 127) were identified through two oral pathology laboratories. controls, pair-matched 1:1 to cases on age (+/- 5 years), gender, appointment date (+/- 1 year), and surgeon, were identified through the office in which the respective case had been biopsied. exposure information regarding smoking, drinking, and other potential risk factors was obtained through a standardized telephone interview. conditional logistic regression was used to calculate measures of association and statistical significance. the odds ratio (or) for current smoking adjusted for drinking, mouthwash use, denture status, and education was 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-7.9) relative to never/ex-smokers. the risk of oed increased with increasing levels of smoking and declined following smoking cessation, with ex-smokers of 15+ years demonstrating no excess risk relative to never smokers. individuals drinking 7+ drinks/week, relative to less than that amount, had over twice the risk of oed (or, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.8) after controlling for smoking, mouthwash use, denture status, and education. adjusted ors tended to increase with increasing levels of alcohol intake. an exploratory analysis suggests that the joint effect of smoking and drinking may be more than additive as regards the risk of oed. the findings of this case-control study implicate smoking and drinking as important risk factors for oed.
benthic cyanobacteria of the genus nodularia are non-toxic, without gas vacuoles, able to glide and genetically more diverse than planktonic nodularia. the heterocytous cyanobacteria form a monophyletic group according to 16s rrna gene sequence data. within this group, phylogenetic and morphological studies have shown that genera such as anabaena and aphanizomenon are intermixed. moreover, the phylogeny of the genus trichormus, which was recently separated from anabaena, has not been investigated. the aim was to study the taxonomy of the genera anabaena, aphanizomenon, nostoc and trichormus belonging to the family nostocaceae (subsection iv.i) by morphological and phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene, rpob and rbclx sequences. new strains were isolated to avoid identification problems caused by morphological changes of strains during cultivation. morphological and phylogenetic data showed that benthic and planktic anabaena strains were intermixed. in addition, the present study confirmed that anabaena and aphanizomenon strains were not monophyletic, as previously demonstrated. the evolutionary distances between the strains indicated that the planktic anabaena and aphanizomenon strains as well as five benthic anabaena strains in cluster 1 could be assigned to a single genus. on the basis of the 16s rrna, rpob and rbclx gene sequences, the anabaena/aphanizomenon strains (cluster 1) were divided into nine supported subclusters which could also be separated morphologically, and which therefore might represent different species. trichormus strains were morphologically and phylogenetically heterogeneous and did not form a monophyletic cluster. these trichormus strains, which were representatives of three distinct species, might actually belong to three genera according to the evolutionary distances. nostoc strains were also heterogeneous and seemed to form a monophyletic cluster, which may contain more than one genus. it was found that certain morphological features were stable and could be used to separate different phylogenetic clusters. for example, the width and the length of akinetes were useful features for classification of the anabaena/aphanizomenon strains in cluster 1. this morphological and phylogenetic study with fresh isolates showed that the current classification of these anabaenoid genera needs to be revised.
crk adaptor proteins act as key signaling integrators for breast tumorigenesis introductionthe phenotypic and functional differences between cells that initiate human breast tumors (cancer stem cells) and those that comprise the tumor bulk are difficult to study using only primary tumor tissue. we embarked on this study hypothesizing that breast cancer cell lines would contain analogous hierarchical differentiation programs to those found in primary breast tumors.methodseight human breast cell lines (human mammary epithelial cells, and mcf10a, mcf7, sum149, sum159, sum1315 and mda.mb.231 cells) were analyzed using flow cytometry for cd44, cd24, and epithelial-specific antigen (esa) expression. limiting dilution orthotopic injections were used to evaluate tumor initiation, while serial colony-forming unit, reconstitution and tumorsphere assays were performed to assess self-renewal and differentiation. pulse-chase bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine [brdu]) labeling was used to examine cell cycle and label-retention of cancer stem cells. cells were treated with paclitaxol and 5-fluorouracil to test selective resistance to chemotherapy, and gene expression profile after chemotherapy were examined.resultsthe percentage of cd44+/cd24- cells within cell lines does not correlate with tumorigenicity, but as few as 100 cells can form tumors when sorted for cd44+/cd24-/low/esa+. furthermore, cd44+/cd24-/esa+ cells can self-renew, reconstitute the parental cell line, retain brdu label, and preferentially survive chemotherapy.conclusionthese data validate the use of cancer cell lines as models for the development and testing of novel therapeutics aimed at eradicating cancer stem cells.
hypothesis only baselines in natural language inference understanding entailment and contradiction is fundamental to understanding natural language, and inference about entailment and contradiction is a valuable testing ground for the development of semantic representations. however, machine learning research in this area has been dramatically limited by the lack of large-scale resources. to address this, we introduce the stanford natural language inference corpus, a new, freely available collection of labeled sentence pairs, written by humans doing a novel grounded task based on image captioning. at 570k pairs, it is two orders of magnitude larger than all other resources of its type. this increase in scale allows lexicalized classifiers to outperform some sophisticated existing entailment models, and it allows a neural network-based model to perform competitively on natural language inference benchmarks for the first time.
typologies of violence exposure and cognitive processing in incarcerated male adolescents the authors used a predictable, externally cued task-switching paradigm to investigate executive control in a severe closed-head injury (chi) population. eighteen individuals with severe chi and 18 controls switched between classifying whether a digit was odd or even and whether a letter was a consonant or vowel on every 4th trial. the target stimuli appeared in a circle divided into 8 equivalent parts. presentation of the stimuli rotated clockwise. participants performed the switching task at both a short (200 ms) and a long (1,000 ms) preparatory interval. although the participants with chi exhibited slower response times and greater switch costs, similar to controls, additional preparatory time reduced the switch costs, and the switch costs were limited to the 1st trial in the run. these findings indicate that participants with severe chi were able to take advantage of time to prepare for the task switch, and the executive control processes involved in the switch costs were completed before the 1st trial of the run ended.
digital breast tomosynthesis parenchymal texture analysis for breast cancer risk estimation: a preliminary study rationale and objectives mammographic density and parenchymal patterns have been shown to be related to the risk of developing breast cancer. thus, computerized texture analysis of breast parenchymal patterns on mammograms may be useful in assessing breast cancer risk.   materials and methods a comparative evaluation was conducted of various computer-extracted texture features of mammographic parenchymal patterns of women with brca1/brca2 gene mutations and those of women at low risk of developing breast cancer. mammograms from 172 subjects (30 women with either the brca1 or brca2 gene mutation and 142 low-risk women) were analyzed. computerized texture features were extracted from regions-of-interest to assess the mammographic parenchymal patterns in the images. receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the performance of these features in the task of distinguishing between the two groups of women.   results quantitative texture analysis on digitized mammograms demonstrated that gene-mutation carriers and low-risk women have different mammographic parenchymal patterns. gene-mutation carriers presented with parenchymal patterns that were denser, coarser, and lower in contrast than those of the low-risk group. for the gene-mutation carriers, their mammographic patterns appear to contain less high-frequency component as indicated by higher coarseness values, lower fractal dimensions, and smaller edge gradients, which yielded corresponding a(z) values of 0.79, 0.84, and 0.78, respectively, in the task of distinguishing between gene-mutation carriers and the low-risk group with the entire dataset. the contrast measure calculated from co-occurrence matrix method, which describes local image variation, yielded an a(z) value of 0.86 in distinguishing between the two groups of women.   conclusion computerized texture analysis of mammograms provides radiographic descriptors of mammographic parenchymal patterns. the computer-extracted features may be useful for identifying women at high risk for breast cancer and for monitoring the treatment of breast cancer patients.
legitimacy, boundary objects & participation in transnational diy biology for years the hci community has struggled to integrate design in research and practice. while design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the hci research community. in this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within hci. following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of hci research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. this model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. to formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.
free virtual navigation using motor imagery through an asynchronous braincomputer interface a brain-computer interface (bci) application focused on the control of a wheelchair must consider the danger which a wrong command would involve in a real situation. virtual reality is a suitable tool to provide subjects with the opportunity to train and test the application before using it under real conditions. recent studies aimed at such control let the subject decide the timing of the interaction, those are the so-called asynchronous bci. one way to reduce the probability of misclassification is to achieve control with only two different mental tasks. the system presented in this paper combines the mentioned advantages in a paradigm that enables the control of a virtual wheelchair with three commands: move forward, turn left and turn right. the results obtained over three subjects support the viability of the proposed system.
prey-mediated effects of transgenic canola on a beneficial, non-target, carabid beetle transgenic crops that express genes targeted against insect pests may also affect non-target insects. for example, lacewings and monarch butterflies have been reported to be susceptible to toxins from bacillus thuringiensis (bt) that are expressed in bt transgenic plants, although these results were obtained in small-scale laboratory assays in which insects were exposed to high levels of transgenically expressed toxin in no-choice tests. we show here that the behaviour of non-target insects can also play a part in determining how their populations will be affected by bt plants.

a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of caffeine and l-theanine both alone and in combination on cerebral blood flow, cognition and mood in this study, we have preformed simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) along with bold (blood oxygen level dependent) and asl (arterial spin labeling)-based fmri during an event-related motor activity in human subjects in order to compare the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic responses recorded in each method. these measurements have allowed us to examine the validity of the biophysical models underlying each modality and, as a result, gain greater insight into the hemodynamic responses to neuronal activation. although prior studies have examined the relationships between these two methodologies through similar experiments, they have produced conflicting results in the literature for a variety of reasons. here, by employing a short-duration, event-related motor task, we have been able to emphasize the subtle temporal differences between the hemodynamic parameters with a high contrast-to-noise ratio. as a result of this improved experimental design, we are able to report that the fmri measured bold response is more correlated with the nirs measure of deoxy-hemoglobin (r = 0.98; p < 10(-20)) than with oxy-hemoglobin (r = 0.71), or total hemoglobin (r = 0.53). this result was predicted from the theoretical grounds of the bold response and is in agreement with several previous works [toronov, v.a.w., choi, j.h., wolf, m., michalos, a., gratton, e., hueber, d., 2001. "investigation of human brain hemodynamics by simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging." med. phys. 28 (4) 521-527.; macintosh, b.j., klassen, l.m., menon, r.s., 2003. "transient hemodynamics during a breath hold challenge in a two part functional imaging study with simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy in adult humans". neuroimage 20 1246-1252.; toronov, v.a.w., walker, s., gupta, r., choi, j.h., gratton, e., hueber, d., webb, a., 2003. "the roles of changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration and regional cerebral blood volume in the fmri bold signal" neuroimage 19 (4) 1521-1531]. these data have also allowed us to examine more detailed measurement models of the fmri signal and comment on the roles of the oxygen saturation and blood volume contributions to the bold response. in addition, we found high correlation between the nirs measured total hemoglobin and asl measured cerebral blood flow (r = 0.91; p < 10(-10)) and oxy-hemoglobin with flow (r = 0.83; p < 10(-05)) as predicted by the biophysical models. finally, we note a significant amount of cross-modality, correlated, inter-subject variability in amplitude change and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic response. the observed co-variance in these parameters between subjects is in agreement with hemodynamic models and provides further support that fmri and nirs have similar vascular sensitivity.
scp160p is required for translational efficiency of codon-optimized mrnas in yeast the yeast spindle pole body (spb), the functional equivalent of mammalian centrosome, duplicates in g1/s phase of the cell cycle and then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. here we describe a link between spb duplication and targeted translation control. when insertion of the newly formed spb into the nuclear envelope fails, the sesa network comprising the gyf domain protein smy2, the translation inhibitor eap1, the mrna-binding protein scp160 and the asc1 protein, specifically inhibits initiation of translation of pom34 mrna that encodes an integral membrane protein of the nuclear pore complex, while having no impact on other mrnas. in response to sesa, pom34 mrna accumulates in the cytoplasm and is not targeted to the er for cotranslational translocation of the protein. reduced level of pom34 is sufficient to restore viability of mutants with defects in spb duplication. we suggest that the sesa network provides a mechanism by which cells can regulate the translation of specific mrnas. this regulation is used to coordinate competing events in the nuclear envelope.

intratumoral therapy of glioblastoma multiforme using genetically engineered transferrin for drug delivery. targeted protein toxins are a new class of reagents with the potential for great tumor selectivity and cytotoxic potency. two such compounds were studied: 1) tf-crm107, a conjugate of human transferrin (tf) and diphtheria toxin with a point mutation (crm107); and 2) 454a12-rra, a conjugate of a monoclonal antibody (454a12) to the human tf receptor and recombinant ricin a chain (rra). both compounds are potent and specific in killing human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro. the authors investigated the activity of these reagents administered intratumorally against solid u251 mg human gliomas in vivo. nude mice with established u251 mg flank tumors (0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter) were randomly assigned to be treated with 100-microliters intratumoral injections of tf-crm107 (10 micrograms) or 454a12-rra (10 micrograms), equimolar doses of crm107 (4.3 micrograms), 454a12 antibody (7.5 micrograms), or rra (1.5 micrograms), or phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) every 2 days for a total of four doses. tumor volume and animal weight were assessed by a blinded observer before each treatment and biweekly for 30 days after initiating therapy. with tf-crm107 administration, tumor regression of greater than 95% occurred by day 14 (p < 0.01) and tumors did not recur by day 30. treatment with 454a12-rra caused a 30% decrease in tumor volume by day 14 (p < 0.01). treatment with equimolar doses of the unconjugated targeted protein toxin components crm107, 454a12, or rra caused significant u251 mg tumor growth inhibition, but the effects were less potent than the antitumor effects of the conjugates. this study also characterized the dose-response effect of tf-crm107 on tumor growth and tumor weight on day 30. nude mice with established u251 mg flank tumors (0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter) were treated with 100-microliters intratumoral injections of 10, 1.0, or 0.1 microgram of tf-crm107 or pbs every 2 days for a total of four doses. all three doses of tf-crm107 significantly inhibited tumor growth by day 14 (p < 0.01) and at day 30 (p < 0.05), with a significant dose-response relationship. this study demonstrated in vivo efficacy of the targeted toxins tf-crm107 and 454a12-rra against a human glioma. with intratumoral administration, the effect of tf-crm107 was tumor-specific and in some animals curative. regional therapy with these potent tumor-specific agents using direct intratumoral infusion should limit systemic toxicity and may be efficacious against brain tumors.
new methods for innovation: the development of a toolbox for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (notes) procedures background the ability to place sutures under eus control might allow development of a new type of transluminal endosurgery. the aim of this study was to develop endoscopic methods for suturing to variable predetermined depths in the wall of the gi tract and to allow fixation of adjacent hollow organs under eus control.   methods a suturing device was constructed for suturing under eus control to any desired depth. sutures can also be placed into hollow or solid organs within 5 cm of the endoscope tip. the device allows multiple sutures to be placed without withdrawing the endoscope. stitching, knot-tying, and thread-cutting are achieved through a 2.8-mm accessory channel.   results multiple (>100) sutures were placed in predetermined gut wall layers in pigs. sutures were placed in the gallbladder (n = 7) and small intestine (n = 8) to fix the gallbladder/small intestine to the stomach and allow traction for the insertion of stents and other devices through the 2 lumens.   conclusion a new method for stitching under flexible eus control is described. this technology was used to place sutures at precise depths in the gi tract. it allowed fixation of other organs to the accessible gi tract for various purposes including delivery of stents and devices for creating anastomoses.
detecting translational regulation by change point analysis of ribosome profiling data sets. the ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the information they encode. here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mrna fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. we exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. these include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both aug and non-aug codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. we also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding rnas (sprcrnas) that encode small proteins. our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.
couples-focused behavioral interventions for prevention of hiv: systematic review of the state of evidence context many hispanic women are at elevated risk for hiv infection because of the sexual behavior of their male partner. yet, couple-based risk-reduction interventions for this population have not been developed and scientifically evaluated.   methods a sample of 146 hispanic couples who received either a risk reduction intervention or the community educational standard of care were followed up at three months (men and women) and six months (women only) to measure the consistency of both condom use and effective contraceptive use, and the frequency of unprotected vaginal sex. analyses were conducted to identify differences between the two groups at baseline and follow-up interviews, and changes over time.   results at follow-up, the two groups did not differ on any risk-related outcomes; over time, both groups increased the reported consistency of condom use and of use of effective contraceptive methods, and reduced their frequency of unprotected sex.   conclusions if further research confirms that simply bringing couples together for a single-session, culturally appropriate risk reduction intervention helps them adopt protective behaviors, more intensive (and costly) interventions may not be necessary.
nitrate-responsive narx-narl represses arginine-mediated induction of the pseudomonas aeruginosa arginine fermentation arcdabc operon. overlap extension represents a new approach to genetic engineering. complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) primers and the polymerase chain reaction are used to generate two dna fragments having overlapping ends. these fragments are combined in a subsequent 'fusion' reaction in which the overlapping ends anneal, allowing the 3' overlap of each strand to serve as a primer for the 3' extension of the complementary strand. the resulting fusion product is amplified further by pcr. specific alterations in the nucleotide (nt) sequence can be introduced by incorporating nucleotide changes into the overlapping oligo primers. using this technique of site-directed mutagenesis, three variants of a mouse major histocompatibility complex class-i gene have been generated, cloned and analyzed. screening of mutant clones revealed at least a 98% efficiency of mutagenesis. all clones sequenced contained the desired mutations, and a low frequency of random substitution estimated to occur at approx. 1 in 4000 nt was detected. this method represents a significant improvement over standard methods of site-directed mutagenesis because it is much faster, simpler and approaches 100% efficiency in the generation of mutant product.
trafficking of the egfr ligand spitz regulates its signaling activity in polarized tissues the star gene is a member of the egfr signaling pathway which has diverse functions throughout drosophila development. in order to investigate the protein distribution for star, we have generated a polyclonal antibody. here, we show that the star protein is expressed perinuclearly in the early female germline and later is found in the oocyte cytoplasm. star is expressed at low levels in other tissues. the subcellular localization of the protein has been determined when star is overexpressed in the eye disc. star is located in the nuclear and contiguous endoplasmic reticulum membranes. a functional assay in the wing disc demonstrates that star expression can activate a nonprocessed membrane-bound form of the egfr ligand spitz and overexpression of star in the eye disc promotes the formation of smaller spitz proteins. based on these results, we propose that the star protein is likely to be involved in spitz ligand processing.
parallel processing in face perception. a series of studies assessed perceptual-motor transmission of stimulus information by measuring lateralization of movement-related brain potentials in a choice reaction task with no-go trials. when stimuli varied in shape and size, lateralized potentials on no-go trials suggested that easily recognized shape information was used to initiate motor preparation and that this preparation was aborted when size analysis signified that the response should be withheld. this indicates that movement preparation can begin once partial perceptual information about a stimulus becomes available, contrary to an assumption of fully discrete models of information processing. by contrast, when stimuli varied only in size, no evidence for preliminary response preparation was obtained, contrary to an assumption of fully continuous models but consistent with asynchronous discrete coding models (miller, 1982, 1988).
optimized linear, quadratic and cubic interpolators for elementary function hardware implementations describes a table compression method employing finite-precision linear interpolation in reciprocal tables. the interpolation method employs a compressed look-up table and a small-sized multiplier to yield an output reciprocal as a simple direct operation. the leading bits of the arbitrarily precise input are used to index the table, and a limited number of succeeding fractional bits are used to interpolate on the table employing a multiply/add operation. the low-order bits of the product are rounded off so that the output reciprocals are guaranteed to be correct to a unit in the last place and provide a round-to-nearest reciprocal for over 90% of arbitrarily precise input arguments. the interpolation method generates 2k-bit faithful reciprocals employing a k-bits-in, (2k+2)-bits-out table and a (k+3)/spl times/(k+3)-bit multiplier. a single-precision faithful reciprocal can be generated employing a table of size 13 kbytes and a 15/spl times/15-bit multiplier, compared to a table size of 46 mbytes for conventional reciprocal tables. the table and dedicated small multiplier efficiently characterize a functional reciprocator unit with, at most, a 2-cycle latency.
"you are getting too old, find a man and marry": social aspects of motivation to choose teacher education abstract the present study explored reasons behind graduates’ decisions to pursue teaching as a career, in a 1-year pre-service teacher education program at an australian university, located in melbourne ( n = 74 ) . a survey collected data about respondents’ reasons for choosing teaching as a career, with open-ended questions eliciting rich qualitative data to elaborate on rating-scale responses. five factors relating to social status, career fit, prior considerations, financial reward and time for family were identified through factor analyses. respondents’ ratings were independent of previous level of qualification and having children or not, with little evidence for gender differences. three distinct clusters of students showed that different combinations of reasons were relevant to each group's choice of teaching as a career, and these reasons were further illustrated and discussed in relation to qualitative data from open-ended survey questions.
moderate and heavy metabolic stress interval training improve arterial stiffness and heart rate dynamics in humans primary objective in order to corroborate the rported performance advantage of poincaré plot indexes as autonomic activity markers, the correlation among these indexes and those computed from the time and frequency domains were obtained.   methods and procedures starting from the rr series derived from the ecg of 21 healthy volunteers during five manoeuvres, longitudinal (l), transverse (t) axis, and autocorrelation (r) from poincaré plots, rmssd and standard deviation (sd) in the temporal domain, and frequency domain indexes were computed.   main outcomes and results poincaré plot indexes were correlated in a better way with the time indexes, rather than the spectral measures. a strong correlation (0.997) between l and sd was observed, while an underlying mathematical relationship was established for t vs rmssd.   conclusions poincaré plot indexes may be considered as equivalent or surrogates of the temporal ones, and they do not have a better performance as autonomic markers.
frequency and patterns of early recanalization after vasectomy family health international (fhi) and engenderhealth conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate a fascial interposition (fi) component of a vas occlusion procedure for male sterilization. a data monitoring committee (dmc) was established to provide independent review of the interim report. the dmc met to review the interim report after enrollment of 552 men. as planned, an estimate of the hazard ratio (hr) for successful vasectomy for the fi group versus the no-fi group controlling for age of the participant and level of experience of the surgeon was obtained for the interim report using cox's proportional hazards regression. the main analysis comparing time to vasectomy success, defined as two consecutive azoospermic semen samples, was highly significant and met the prespecified level for stopping enrollment (hr=1.54, p<0.01). however, a troublesome age by vasectomy technique interaction became apparent in the analysis. fi was clearly beneficial for younger males. however, the trend for older men was not as clear. the dmc recommended continuing the trial to better study this interaction and obtain more data to clarify the effect of fi for older men. after consulting further with the dmc, the study statisticians presented the interim report to senior management at fhi. a meeting between fhi senior management and the dmc followed. after much deliberation, trial enrollment was terminated. follow-up of participants already enrolled in the study continued as planned. this paper presents the issues involved in the decision to terminate the study.
designing and tracking play styles in solving the incognitum education and psychology studies have used motivational constructs called achievement goals to predict learning success and response to failure. in this article we adapted classroom achievement goal scales to instead measure gaming achievement goals. we collected survey data from 432 university students to empirically examine the applicability and utility of achievement goal constructs from education research to gaming. we introduced a new approach to player types based on mastery and performance gaming achievement goals. four types are studied: super-achievers, mastery-only, performance-only, and non-achievers. we also examined the relationship between our four achievement goal player types to the traditional achiever, explorer player types. we found that interest in exploration in games can exist in any of the four types, but those with strong mastery goals have the lowest interest in exploration. gender and gaming frequency were significantly related to gaming achievement goals. the implications and suggestions for designing games for learning and entertainment are discussed.
eukaryotic regulatory element conservation analysis and identification using comparative genomics. analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mrna/dna and cross-species protein alignments. a new tool, blat, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mrna/dna alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. blat's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping k-mers in the genome. this index fits inside the ram of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. blat has several major stages. it uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. it performs an alignment between homologous regions. it stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). finally, blat revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. this paper describes how blat was optimized. effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various k-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. blat is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based blat server for the human genome.
rapid identification of urinary tract infection bacteria using hyperspectral whole-organism fingerprinting and artificial neural networks. the implementation of artificial neural networks (anns) to the analysis of multivariate data is reviewed, with particular reference to the analysis of pyrolysis mass spectra. the need for and benefits of multivariate data analysis are explained followed by a discussion of anns and their optimisation. finally, an example of the use of anns for the quantitative deconvolution of the pyrolysis mass spectra of staphylococcus aureus mixed with escherichia coli is demonstrated.
easy and efficient protocol for oomycete dna extraction suitable for population genetic analysis backgroundmicrosatellites or single sequence repeats (ssrs) are a powerful choice of marker in the study of phytophthora population biology, epidemiology, ecology, genetics and evolution. a strategy was tested in which the publicly available unigene datasets extracted from genome sequences of p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum were mined for candidate ssr markers that could be applied to a wide range of phytophthora species.resultsa first approach, aimed at the identification of polymorphic ssr loci common to many phytophthora species, yielded 171 reliable sequences containing 211 ssrs. microsatellites were identified from 16 target species representing the breadth of diversity across the genus. repeat number ranged from 3 to 16 with most having seven repeats or less and four being the most commonly found. trinucleotide repeats such as (aag)n, (agg)n and (agc)n were the most common followed by pentanucleotide, tetranucleotide and dinucleotide repeats. a second approach was aimed at the identification of useful loci common to a restricted number of species more closely related to p. sojae (p. alni, p. cambivora, p. europaea and p. fragariae). this analysis yielded 10 trinucleotide and 2 tetranucleotide ssrs which were repeated 4, 5 or 6 times.conclusionkey studies on inter- and intra-specific variation of selected microsatellites remain. despite the screening of conserved gene coding regions, the sequence diversity between species was high and the identification of useful ssr loci applicable to anything other than the most closely related pairs of phytophthora species was challenging. that said, many novel ssr loci for species other than the three 'source species' (p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum) are reported, offering great potential for the investigation of phytophthora populations. in addition to the presence of microsatellites, many of the amplified regions may represent useful molecular marker regions for other studies as they are highly variable and easily amplifiable from different phytophthora species.
impact + resistance training improves bone health and body composition in prematurely menopausal breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial targeted exercise training could reduce risk factors for fracture and obesity-related diseases that increase from breast cancer treatment, but has not been sufficiently tested. we hypothesized that progressive, moderate-intensity resistance + impact training would increase or maintain hip and spine bone mass, lean mass and fat mass and reduce bone turnover compared to controls who participated in a low-intensity, non-weight bearing stretching program. we conducted a randomized, controlled trial in 106 women with early stage breast cancer who were >1 year post-radiation and/or chemotherapy, ≥50 years of age at diagnosis and postmenopausal, free from osteoporosis and medications for bone loss, resistance and impact exercise naïve, and cleared to exercise by a physician. women were randomly assigned to participate in 1 year of thrice-weekly progressive, moderate-intensity resistance + impact (jump) exercise or in a similar frequency and length control program of progressive, low-intensity stretching. primary endpoints were bone mineral density (bmd; g/cm2) of the hip and spine and whole body bone-free lean and fat mass (kg) determined by dxa and biomarkers of bone turnover—serum osteocalcin (ng/ml) and urinary deoxypyrodiniline cross-links (nmol/mmolcr). women in the resistance + impact training program preserved bmd at the lumbar spine (0.47 vs. −2.13%; p = 0.001) compared to controls. the resistance + impact group had a smaller increase in osteocalcin (7.0 vs. 27%, p = 0.03) and a larger decrease in deoxypyrodinoline (−49.9 vs. −32.6%, p = 0.06) than controls. increases in lean mass from resistance + impact training were greatest among women currently taking aromatase inhibitors compared to controls not on this therapy (p = 0.01). our combined program of resistance + impact exercise reduced risk factors for fracture among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (bcs) and may be particularly relevant for bcs on aromatase inhibitors (ais) because of the additional benefit of exercise on muscle mass that could reduce falls.
the production of highly effective enzyme complexes of cellulases and hemicellulases based on the penicillium verruculosum strain for the hydrolysis of plant raw materials in 1944 nelson (1) described a calorimetric method which represented a distinct step forward. he devised a new arsenophosphate solution as the chromogenic agent, and for copper reagent selected one of our older carbonate-tartrate solutions which was devised for the iodometric technique. in the following year, in a new alkaline copper reagent, we replaced the carbonate-bicarbonate buffer by phosphate as the alkali (2) and suggested that this reagent could be used for the calorimetric technique with nelson’s reagent. subsequent observations convinced us, however, that this reagent is not suitable for accurate calorimetric work, because it interferes with the stability of the colors developed with chromogenic reagents, whereas, when carbonate is the alkali, nelson’s reagent yields very stable colors. the copper-carbonate-tartrate reagent that nelson selected (as weli as the phosphate reagent we recommended) has, however, definite disadvantages when used for calorimetry. since the reagent was devised for the iodometric technique, its copper content is far above the concentration needed in calorimetry and this excess copper requires a commensurate amount of tartrate to be kept in solution. since tartrate measurably reduces copper, especially when the reagent is heated, in calorimetry it is the main cause of deviations from beer’s law. we have therefore decreased the copper content of the reagent to the amount actually usable in calorimetry, and reduced the concentration of tartrate to the minimum required. the self-reduction of such a solution, we found, is virtually negligible. 1 liter of this reagent. contains 4 gm. of cus04.5hz0, 24 gm. of anhydrous na2c03, 16 gm. of nahc03, 12 gm. of rochelle salt, and 18 gm. of anhydrous na&os. preparation of reagent-the carbonate and rochelle salt are dissolved
improved information structure analysis of scientific documents through discourse and lexical constraints argumentative zoning (az) -- analysis of the argumentative structure of a scientific paper -- has proved useful for a number of information access tasks. current approaches to az rely on supervised machine learning (ml). requiring large amounts of annotated data, these approaches are expensive to develop and port to different domains and tasks. a potential solution to this problem is to use weakly-supervised ml instead. we investigate the performance of four weakly-supervised classifiers on scientific abstract data annotated for multiple az classes. our best classifier based on the combination of active learning and self-training outperforms our best supervised classifier, yielding a high accuracy of 81% when using just 10% of the labeled data. this result suggests that weakly-supervised learning could be employed to improve the practical applicability and portability of az across different information access tasks.
bayesian inference of plastosphere viscosities near the kunlun fault, northern tibet published slip rates for the owens valley fault zone in eastern california based on geodetic data and elastic half-space models (5–7 mm/yr) are faster than longer term geologic rates (2–3 mm/yr). we use global positioning system data spanning the central owens valley, a more realistic rheological model with an elastic upper crust over a viscoelastic lower crust and upper mantle, and paleoseismic data from adjacent faults, to show that this difference could reflect earthquake-cycle effects. we estimate a long-term rate (2.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr) and earthquake recurrence interval (2750 +350/−1000 yr) from the geodetic data, both in agreement with independent geologic estimates.
entertainment modeling through physiology in physical play this preliminary study explores the use of heart rate variability (hrv) as an indicator of user state. in the study, a visual display is used to vary the levels of a complexity factor to assess the impact on user mental effort in a monitoring task mental effort is measured both subjectively and physiologically. two findings indicate the potential value of hrv. first, user erv showed significant discriminatory sensitivity to the manipulation of the independent variable on the basis of domain experience. second, hrv appeared to indicate the point at which user capacity to process targets was exceeded. results warrant further investigation but suggest the use of hrv as a tool for design and analysis of user interfaces, and as a research basis for use as component of an adaptive interface.
multiple granularity descriptors for fine-grained categorization semantic part localization can facilitate fine-grained categorization by explicitly isolating subtle appearance differences associated with specific object parts. methods for pose-normalized representations have been proposed, but generally presume bounding box annotations at test time due to the difficulty of object detection. we propose a model for fine-grained categorization that overcomes these limitations by leveraging deep convolutional features computed on bottom-up region proposals. our method learns whole-object and part detectors, enforces learned geometric constraints between them, and predicts a fine-grained category from a pose-normalized representation. experiments on the caltech-ucsd bird dataset confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-grained categorization methods in an end-to-end evaluation without requiring a bounding box at test time.
place of articulation and first formant transition pattern both affect perception of voicing in english voice quality variations include a set of voicing sound source modifications ranging from laryngealized to normal to breathy phonation. analysis of reiterant imitations of two sentences by ten female and six male talkers has shown that the potential acoustic cues to this type of voice quality variation include: (1) increases to the relative amplitude of the fundamental frequency component as open quotient increases; (2) increases to the amount of aspiration noise that replaces higher frequency harmonics as the arytenoids become more separated; (3) increases to lower formant bandwidths; and (4) introduction of extra pole zeros in the vocal-tract transfer function associated with tracheal coupling. perceptual validation of the relative importance of these cues for signaling a breathy voice quality has been accomplished using a new voicing source model for synthesis of more natural male and female voices. the new formant synthesizer, klsyn88, is fully documented here. results of the perception study indicate that, contrary to previous research which emphasizes the importance of increased amplitude of the fundamental component, aspiration noise is perceptually most important. without its presence, increases to the fundamental component may induce the sensation of nasality in a high-pitched voice. further results of the acoustic analysis include the observations that: (1) over the course of a sentence, the acoustic manifestations of breathiness vary considerably--tending to increase for unstressed syllables, in utterance-final syllables, and at the margins of voiceless consonants; (2) on average, females are more breathy than males, but there are very large differences between subjects within each gender; (3) many utterances appear to end in a "breathy-laryngealized" type of vibration; and (4) diplophonic irregularities in the timing of glottal periods occur frequently, especially at the end of an utterance. diplophonia and other deviations from perfect periodicity may be important aspects of naturalness in synthesis.
comprehensive study of cd compensation and carrier phase estimation in optical communication systems influenced by equalization enhanced phase noise we demonstrate unrepeated 200-km transmission of 40-gbit/s 16-qam signals using a digital coherent receiver, where the decision-directed carrier-phase estimation is employed. the phase fluctuation is effectively eliminated in the 16-qam system with such a phase-estimation method, when the linewidth of semiconductor lasers for the transmitter and the local oscillator is 150 khz. finite-impulse-response (fir) filters at the receiver compensate for 4,000-ps/nm group-velocity dispersion (gvd) of the 200-km-long single-mode fiber and a part of self-phase modulation (spm) in the digital domain. in spite of the launched power limitation due to spm, the acceptable bit-error rate performance is obtained owing to high sensitivity of the digital coherent receiver.
task-dependent intermuscular motor unit synchronization between medial and lateral vastii muscles during dynamic and isometric squats electromyograms (emgs) are measured by bipolar surface electrodes that quantify potential differences. bipolar potentials over penniform muscles may be associated with errors. our assumption was that muscle activity can be quantified more reliably and with a higher spatial resolution using current measurements. the purpose of this work is: (a) to introduce the concept of current measurements to detect muscle activity, (b) to show the coherences observed over a segment of a typical penniform muscle, the gastrocnemius medialis where one would expect a synchronicity of the activation, and (c) to show the amount of mixing that is caused by the finite inter electrode resistance. a current amplifier was developed. emgs were recorded at 40% of maximum voluntary contraction during isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius medialis. emgs of twelve persons were recorded with an array of four peripheral and one central electrode. monopolar emgs were recorded for "all-potential", "center at current" and "all-current" conditions. coherence revealed the similarity of signals recorded from neighboring electrodes. coherence was high for the "all-potential", significant for the "current at center" condition and disappeared in the "all-current" condition. it was concluded that emg array recordings strongly depends on the measurement configuration. the proposed current amplifier significantly improves spatial resolution of emg array recordings because the inter-electrode cross talk is reduced.
electromechanical feedback with reduced cellular connectivity alters electrical activity in an infarct injured left ventricle: a finite element model study. mechanoelectric transduction can initiate cardiac arrhythmias. to examine the origins of this effect at the cellular level, we made whole cell voltage-clamp recordings from acutely isolated rat ventricular myocytes under controlled strain. longitudinal stretch elicited noninactivating inward cationic currents that increased the action potential duration. these stretch-activated currents could be blocked by 100 microm gd(3+) but not by octanol. the current-voltage relationship was nearly linear, with a reversal potential of approximately -6 mv in normal tyrode solution. current density varied with sarcomere length (sl) according to i (pa/pf) = 8.3 - 5.0 sl (microm). repeated attempts to record single channel currents from stretch-activated ion channels failed, in accord with the absence of such data from the literature. the inability to record single channel currents may be a result of channels being located on internal membranes such as the t tubules or, possibly, inactivation of the channels by the mechanics of patch formation.
rfvp: rollback-free value prediction with safe-to-approximate loads a significant part of future microprocessor real estate will be dedicated to 12 or 13 caches. these on-chip caches will heavily impact processor performance, power dissipation, and thermal management strategies. there are a number of interconnect design considerations that influence power/performance/area characteristics of large caches, such as wire models (width/spacing/repeaters), signaling strategy (rc/differential/transmission), router design, etc. yet, to date, there exists no analytical tool that takes all of these parameters into account to carry out a design space exploration for large caches and estimate an optimal organization. in this work, we implement two major extensions to the cacti cache modeling tool that focus on interconnect design for a large cache. first, we add the ability to model different types of wires, such as rc-based wires with different power/delay characteristics and differential low-swing buses. second, we add the ability to model non-uniform cache access (nuca). we not only adopt state-of-the-art design space exploration strategies for nuca, we also enhance this exploration by considering on-chip network contention and a wider spectrum of wiring and routing choices. we present a validation analysis of the new tool (to be released as cacti 6.0) and present a case study to showcase how the tool can improve architecture research methodologies.
interactions of betulinic acid with xenobiotic metabolizing and antioxidative enzymes in dmba-treated sprague dawley female rats. we have completed a phase i trial in women of the proposed chemopreventive natural product indole-3-carbinol (i3c). women received oral doses of 400, 600, 800, 1,000, and 1,200 mg i3c. serial plasma samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for i3c and several of its condensation products. i3c itself was not detectable in plasma. the only detectable i3c-derived product was 3,3′-diindolylmethane (dim). mean cmax for dim increased from 61 ng/ml at the 400-mg i3c dose to 607 ng/ml following a 1,000-mg dose. no further increase was observed following a 1,200-mg dose. a similar result was obtained for the area under the curve, which increased from 329 h ng/ml at the 400-mg dose to 3,376 h ng/ml after a 1,000-mg dose of i3c. significant interindividual quantitative variation was seen in plasma dim values within each dosing group, but the overall profiles were qualitatively similar, with no quantifiable dim before dosing, tmax at ∼2 h, and dim levels near or below 15 ng/ml (the limit of quantitation), by 24 h. different results were obtained for 14 subjects who received a 400-mg dose of i3c after 8 weeks of twice-daily i3c dosing. although the predose sampling occurred at least 12 h after the last known ingestion of i3c, 6 of 14 subjects exhibited cmax for dim in their predose plasma. despite this high initial value, plasma dim for all subjects decreased to near or below the limit of quantitation within the 12-h sampling period. possible reasons for this disparity between apparent t1/2 of dim and the high predose values are discussed.

mers-coronavirus replication induces severe in vitro cytopathology and is strongly inhibited by cyclosporin a or interferon-α treatment the complete genomic nucleotide sequence (29.7kb) of a hong kong severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus (sars-cov) strain hk-39 is determined. phylogenetic analysis of the genomic sequence reveals it to be a distinct member of the coronaviridae family. 5′ race assay confirms the presence of at least six subgenomic transcripts all containing the predicted intergenic sequences. five open reading frames (orfs), namely orf1a, 1b, s, m, and n, are found to be homologues to other cov members, and three more unknown orfs (x1, x2, and x3) are unparalleled in all other known cov species. optimal alignment and computer analysis of the homologous orfs has predicted the characteristic structural and functional domains on the putative genes. the overall nucleotides conservation of the homologous orfs is low (<5%) compared with other known covs, implying that hk-39 is a newly emergent sars-cov phylogenetically distant from other known members. simplot analysis supports this finding, and also suggests that this novel virus is not a product of a recent recombinant from any of the known characterized covs. together, these results confirm that hk-39 is a novel and distinct member of the coronaviridae family, with unknown origin. the completion of the genomic sequence of the virus will assist in tracing its origin.
an automatic email distribution by using text mining and reinforcement learning the experimental evidence accumulated over the past 20 years indicates that textindexing systems based on the assignment of appropriately weighted single terms produce retrieval results that are superior to those obtainable with other more elaborate text representations. these results depend crucially on the choice of effective term weighting systems. this paper summarizes the insights gained in automatic term weighting, and provides baseline single term indexing models with which other more elaborate content analysis procedures can be compared.
testing the clinical implications of planned missing data designs. the authors describe 2 efficiency (planned missing data) designs for measurement: the 3-form design and the 2-method measurement design. the 3-form design, a kind of matrix sampling, allows researchers to leverage limited resources to collect data for 33% more survey questions than can be answered by any 1 respondent. power tables for estimating correlation effects illustrate the benefit of this design. the 2-method measurement design involves a relatively cheap, less valid measure of a construct and an expensive, more valid measure of the same construct. the cost effectiveness of this design stems from the fact that few cases have both measures, and many cases have just the cheap measure. with 3 brief simulations involving structural equation models, the authors show that compared with the same-cost complete cases design, a 2-method measurement design yields lower standard errors and a higher effective sample size for testing important study parameters. with a large cost differential between cheap and expensive measures and small effect sizes, the benefits of the design can be enormous. strategies for using these 2 designs are suggested.
temperament and character dimensions of patients with adult separation anxiety disorder. little attention has been given to measuring symptoms of separation anxiety (sa) in adulthood. the development of an adult separation anxiety questionnaire (asa-27) is described and compared to a previously derived adult separation anxiety semistructured interview (asa-si). principal components analysis revealed a coherent construct of sa with high internal consistency (cronbach's alpha =.95) and sound test-retest reliability (r =.86; p <.001). a receiver operation characteristic (roc) analysis against the semistructured interview yielded a high area under the curve index (auc = 0.9) suggesting that the questionnaire is an adequate alternative measure of sa. results of this study support previous research suggesting that a construct of sa may be readily measured in adults.
metric learning based data augmentation for environmental sound classification we present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. we describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. we give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. we experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
blood tests may predict early primary myelofibrosis in patients presenting with essential thrombocythemia to determine prognosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl) failing to front-line therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (atra) and anthracyclines, outcome of 52 patients (32 m/20 f; age: 37, 3–72) included in pethema trials lpa96 and lpa99 who presented with either molecular failure (molrel, n=16) or hematological relapse (hemrel, n=36) was analyzed. salvage therapy consisted of atra and high-dose ara-c-based chemotherapy (hdac) in most cases (83%), followed by stem-cell transplantation (autologous, 18; allogeneic, 10; syngeneic, 1). fourteen patients with molrel (88%) achieved second molecular complete response (molcr), whereas 81% hemrel patients responded to second-line treatment, with 58% molcr. after median follow-up of 45 months, four molrel and 18 hemrel patients, respectively, experienced a second relapse. outcome after molrel compared favorably to hemrel, with longer survival (5-year survival: 64±14 vs 24±8%, p=0.01) and lower relapse risk (5-year relapse risk: 30±13 vs 64±9%; p=0.044). additionally, age⩽40 and male gender were favorable variables for survival, whereas molecular response predicted longer leukemia-free survival. in conclusion, early institution of salvage therapy at molecular failure, before onset of hematological relapse, is beneficial in apl. moreover, given the poor outcome of hemrel managed with atra and hdac, use of alternative therapeutic strategies in this setting is warranted.
taurine inhibits apoptosis by preventing formation of the apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosome. the lack of a well‐characterized in‐vitro cell culture model of load‐induced cardiac ischaemia has hampered investigations into the mechanism of ischemic injury. we therefore developed a new in‐vitro model of cardiac ischaemia that mimics distinct features of ischaemic injury.
an empirical evaluation of techniques for ranking semantic associations discovering complex and meaningful relationships, which we call semantic associations, is an important challenge. just as ranking of documents is a critical component of today's search engines, ranking of relationships will be essential in tomorrow's semantic search engines that would support discovery and mining of the semantic web. building upon our recent work on specifying types of semantic associations in rdf graphs, which are possible to create through semantic metadata extraction and annotation, we discuss a framework where ranking techniques can be used to identify more interesting and more relevant semantic associations. our techniques utilize alternative ways of specifying the context using ontology. this enables capturing users' interests more precisely and better quality results in relevance ranking.
mobbing-like behavior by pilot whales towards killer whales: a response to resource competition or perceived predation risk? the strait of gibraltar is inhabited by around 216 pilot whales, which are present all year round, and nothing is known about their social structure. the aim of this study is to analyse the inter-individual association patterns within this pilot whales community to (1) provide an insight on their long-term social system and (2) to assess the relationship between sexes within this social system. between 1999 and 2006, 23,004 km was sampled in the strait of gibraltar, and 4,887 images of dorsal fins of pilot whales were taken from 226 groups. the sex of 56 of the individuals could be determined genetically. the strength of the behavioural relationships between dyads of individuals was calculated, and the temporal aspects of the social structure were evaluated, showing in a non-random social structure made by constant companions. the preferred associations between individuals consisted in associations of males–females. eight long-term units could be found with different degrees of association rates. consequently, we propose that, in the strait, the pilot whales exhibit a hierarchical social system composed of a population encompassing several clans of pilot whales each containing several pods. pods will then be formed by several line units, similar to killer whale matrilineal units.
justifying the judgment process a ff ects confidence but neither accuracy , nor strategy use the distinction between similarity-based and rule-based strategies has instigated a large body of research in categorization and judgment. within both domains, the task characteristics guiding strategy shifts are increasingly well documented. across domains, past research has observed shifts from rule-based strategies in judgment to similarity-based strategies in categorization, but limited these comparisons to 1 prototypical environment, a linear task structure, and a restricted set of strategies. to systematically compare the 2 domains, we considered several instantiations of rule-based and similarity-based strategies and examined strategy choice across different types of judgment and categorization tasks. between participants, we varied task characteristics from a 1-dimensional linear to a multidimensional linear and to 2 multidimensional nonlinear tasks. irrespective of domain, strategies considered, or model comparison technique used, we find that more participants relied on similarity-based strategies when the functional relationship between the cues and the criterion was nonlinear. shifts from rule-based strategies in judgment to similarity-based strategies in categorization, however, were rare and most pronounced in 1-dimensional environments. these results support the hypothesis that the cognitive strategies people select to solve a judgment or categorization task depend less on the domain but more on the complexity of the task.

contact irritant responses of aedes aegypti using sublethal concentration and focal application of pyrethroid chemicals abstract a modular and novel assay system for rapid mass screening of chemical compounds for contact irritant and spatial repellent actions against adult mosquitoes is described. the responses of aedes aegypti to various concentrations of 3 topical repellents, deet, bayrepel®, and ss220, were evaluated. at treatment concentrations ≥25 nmol/cm2 of ss220, mosquitoes exhibited significant contact irritant (escape) and spatial repellent (movement away from the chemical source) responses, whereas, a 10-fold increase in the treatment concentration of deet and bayrepel was required to produce similar responses. the novel bioassay system detected contact irritancy and spatial repellency activity with reproducible results and provided baseline data for determining minimum effective concentrations for other chemicals. the system is compact in size, easy to decontaminate, and requires only a minute quantity of chemical compound.
physical and psychosocial factors associated with wrist or hand pain among australian hospital-based nurses in study 1, the pain catastrophizing scale (pcs) was administered to 425 undergraduates. analyses yielded a three component solution comprising (a) rumination, (b) magnification, and (c) helplessness. in study 2, 30 undergraduate participants were classified as catastrophizers (n = 15) or noncatastrophizers (n = 15) on the basis of their pcs scores and participated in an cold pressor procedure. catastrophizers reported significantly more negative pain-related thoughts, greater emotional distress, and greater pain intensity than noncatastrophizers. study 3 examined the relation between pcs scores, negative pain-related thoughts, and distress in 28 individuals undergoing an aversive electrodiagnostic medical procedure. catastrophizers reported more negative pain-related thoughts, more emotional distress, and more pain than noncatastrophizers. study 4 examined the relation between the pcs and measures of depression, trait anxiety, negative affectivity, and fear of pain. analyses revealed moderate correlations among these measures, but only the pcs contributed significant unique variance t o the prediction of pain intensity.
ima genome-f 4 genome sequencing projects have been initiated for a wide range of eukaryotes. a few projects have reached completion, but most exist as draft assemblies. as one of the main reasons to sequence a genome is to obtain its catalog of genes, an important question is how complete or completable the catalog is in unfinished genomes. to answer this question, we have identified a set of core eukaryotic genes (cegs), that are extremely highly conserved and which we believe are present in low copy numbers in higher eukaryotes. from an analysis of a phylogenetically diverse set of eukaryotic genome assemblies, we found that the proportion of cegs mapped in draft genomes provides a useful metric for describing the gene space, and complements the commonly used n50 length and x-fold coverage values.
toward overcoming culture, skill and situation hurdles in human-computer interaction a novel definition of visual languages allows a uniform approach to satisfying the needs of visual reasoning faced in visual human-computer interaction. the way the machine associates a computational meaning with an image, and conversely, the way it generates an image on the screen from a computation are formally described. a definition of a visual sentence and of a visual language as a set of visual sentences is discussed. a hierarchy of visual languages is derived in relation to the requirements for intelligible, manageable and trustable interaction between humans and computers.
the clinicopathological significance of reic expression in colorectal carcinomas. aim to investigate the promoter methylation status and mrna expression of dkk-3 and wif-1 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).   methods dkk-3 and wif-1 acted as wnt-antagonists and tumor suppressors, but hypermethylation of the gene promoter and low mrna expression activated wnt signaling aberrantly and induced the development of hcc. methylation status of the dkk-3 and wif-1 gene promoter was investigated using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in tumor and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 33 hcc patients and 20 normal liver tissues served as control. the expression of dkk-3 and wif-1 mrna was also determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr. the relationship between methylation, mrna expression, and clinical data, as well as methylation and mrna expression of the two genes were analyzed.   results the methylation of dkk-3 and wif-1 genes in hcc increased significantly compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues and normal control tissues (chi(2) =7.79, p < 0.05; chi(2) = 4.89, p < 0.05), and no significant difference in methylation between adjacent non-cancerous tissues and normal control tissues was observed. in hcc tissues, significant differences in the dkk-3 promoter methylation were observed in age and cirrhosis, and significant differences of the wif-1 promoter methylation were observed in hbsag and cirrhosis. the average expression of dkk-3 mrna in hcc and adjacent non-cancerous tissues was increased significantly compared with normal control tissues. the average expression of wif-1 mrna showed no significant difference among the three tissues. the mrna expression of dkk-3 gene in hcc was decreased as the pathological grade increased.   conclusion the aberrant promoter methylation and decreased expression of dkk-3 and wif-1 may be an important mechanism in hcc, and may be a far-reaching significance in early diagnosis and therapy of hcc.
response to 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) vaccine in hiv-infected patients and the influence of prior seasonal influenza vaccination dialysis patients show impaired responses to several vaccines. limited recent data are available on influenza vaccination in these patients. in the 1998-1999 influenza season, 44 dialysis patients received a standard trivalent vaccination followed by a booster two months later. the serum antibody responses in these patients were compared with those found in healthy subjects. a fourfold rise in serum hemagglutination inhibition titre was achieved in 23-58% of all patients. protective titres were reached in 53-93% of the patients. since protective antibody titers can be induced, it is recommended to vaccinate dialysis patients annually against influenza.
long-term influence of recurrent acute otitis media on neural involuntary attention switching in 2-year-old children objectives: noise, as an unwanted sound, has become one of modern society’s environmental conundrums, and many children are exposed to higher noise levels than previously assumed. however, the effects of background noise on central auditory processing of toddlers, who are still acquiring language skills, have so far not been determined. the authors evaluated the effects of background noise on toddlers’ speech-sound processing by recording event-related brain potentials. the hypothesis was that background noise modulates neural speech-sound encoding and degrades speech-sound discrimination. design: obligatory p1 and n2 responses for standard syllables and the mismatch negativity (mmn) response for five different syllable deviants presented in a linguistic multifeature paradigm were recorded in silent and background noise conditions. the participants were 18 typically developing 22- to 26-month-old monolingual children with healthy ears. results: the results showed that the p1 amplitude was smaller and the n2 amplitude larger in the noisy conditions compared with the silent conditions. in the noisy condition, the mmn was absent for the intensity and vowel changes and diminished for the consonant, frequency, and vowel duration changes embedded in speech syllables. furthermore, the frontal mmn component was attenuated in the noisy condition. however, noise had no effect on p1, n2, or mmn latencies. conclusions: the results from this study suggest multiple effects of background noise on the central auditory processing of toddlers. it modulates the early stages of sound encoding and dampens neural discrimination vital for accurate speech perception. these results imply that speech processing of toddlers, who may spend long periods of daytime in noisy conditions, is vulnerable to background noise. in noisy conditions, toddlers’ neural representations of some speech sounds might be weakened. thus, special attention should be paid to acoustic conditions and background noise levels in children’s daily environments, like day-care centers, to ensure a propitious setting for linguistic development. in addition, the evaluation and improvement of daily listening conditions should be an ordinary part of clinical intervention of children with linguistic problems.
identification of human papillomavirus type 18 e6 polypeptide in cells derived from human cervical carcinomas. summary a human cell line designated as siha has been established from cancerous tissues of the cervix uteri. the studies with light and electron microscopy have revealed the definite epithelial characteristics of the siha cells.
expression analysis and in silico characterization of intronic long noncoding rnas in renal cell carcinoma: emerging functional associations background both the validity and the reproducibility of microarray-based clinical research have been challenged. there is a need for critical review of the statistical analysis and reporting in published microarray studies that focus on cancer-related clinical outcomes.   methods studies published through 2004 in which microarray-based gene expression profiles were analyzed for their relation to a clinical cancer outcome were identified through a medline search followed by hand screening of abstracts and full text articles. studies that were eligible for our analysis addressed one or more outcomes that were either an event occurring during follow-up, such as death or relapse, or a therapeutic response. we recorded descriptive characteristics for all the selected studies. a critical review of outcome-related statistical analyses was undertaken for the articles published in 2004.   results ninety studies were identified, and their descriptive characteristics are presented. sixty-eight (76%) were published in journals of impact factor greater than 6. a detailed account of the 42 studies (47%) published in 2004 is reported. twenty-one (50%) of them contained at least one of the following three basic flaws: 1) in outcome-related gene finding, an unstated, unclear, or inadequate control for multiple testing; 2) in class discovery, a spurious claim of correlation between clusters and clinical outcome, made after clustering samples using a selection of outcome-related differentially expressed genes; or 3) in supervised prediction, a biased estimation of the prediction accuracy through an incorrect cross-validation procedure.   conclusions the most common and serious mistakes and misunderstandings recorded in published studies are described and illustrated. based on this analysis, a proposal of guidelines for statistical analysis and reporting for clinical microarray studies, presented as a checklist of "do's and don'ts," is provided.
latent heterogeneity in long-term trajectories of body mass index in older adults objectives: to examine the relative importance of broad social change, cohort-specific change, and population composition on trends in adult obesity over the past two decades. methods: using the national health interview study from 1982 through 2002, 5-year birth cohorts are examined for differential trends in obesity. logistic regression is used to separate out the effects of population composition from broad social change and cohort-specific change. results: results confirm that age-specific obesity rates have been increasing for successively born cohorts, indicating broad social change. there is little evidence for cohort-specific change, and only small effects of compositional change. discussion: although increasing diversity in the older population will probably result in higher rates of obesity in the future, increasingly sedentary lives and the uncertain impact of smoking cessation on weight outweigh population composition effects. more research is needed on the impact of lifestyle behaviors on the american population.
ontogeny of positional behavior and support use among colobus angolensis palliatus of the diani forest, kenya the relationships between locomotion, body size, and habitat use in six sympatric old world monkeys are examined to test whether the associations found are consistent with those demonstrated in previous studies (fleagle and mittermeier [1980] am. j. phys. anthropol. 52:301-314; gebo and chapman [1995] am. j. phys. anthropol. 97:49-76). colobus polykomos, c. badius, c. verus, cercopithecus diana, c. campbelli, and cercocebus atys were studied for 14 months in the ivory coast's tai forest. analyses reveal that (1) larger monkeys tend to frequent those strata containing the greatest densities of large supports while smaller monkeys are more diverse in their canopy use; (2) high frequencies of leaping are not necessarily confined to the understory, and understory specialists are not necessarily frequent leapers; (3) body size does not consistently predict leaping or climbing frequencies; (4) in general, climbing is more frequent during foraging and leaping is more common during travel; (5) larger supports are used during travel while smaller supports are used during foraging; and (6) larger monkeys do not always use larger supports than do smaller monkeys. some of the factors contributing to the manner that locomotion, body size, and habitat use are related in cercopithecid monkeys are discussed.
usefulness of endoscopic biopsy using foxp3+ treg up-regulation in the duodenal papilla in the differential diagnosis between autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer background the rates of spontaneous remission and relapse of autoimmune pancreatitis (aip) are not known.   objective to study the clinicopathologic factors predictive of remission and relapse in cases of aip.   design retrospective study.   patients of the 20 patients with aip, complete response to steroid therapy was recognized in 12 patients, and the remaining 8 patients improved without steroid therapy. seven patients experienced a relapse.   results patients who were seronegative for immunoglobulin (ig) g4, had no obstructive jaundice, no diabetes mellitus, no swelling of the duodenal papilla, negative staining of the duodenal papilla for igg4, and focal pancreatic swelling showed a greater tendency toward spontaneous remission (p < .05). the results of multivariate analysis revealed that negative staining of the duodenal papilla for igg4 was the only independent predictor of spontaneous remission of aip (odds ratio [or] 1.395, p = .0304). seropositivity for igg4, diffuse swelling of the pancreas, and the presence of stricture in the lower part of the bile duct were significantly associated with a relapse of aip (p < .05) according to the results of univariate analysis, whereas the results of multivariate analysis revealed only diffuse pancreatic swelling as an independent predictor of a relapse of aip (or 26.197, p = .0331).   conclusions endoscopic findings are of useful prognostic value, because patients with aip and with negative staining of the duodenal papilla for igg4 appeared to have a higher frequency of remission without steroid therapy. patients with aip and with diffuse pancreatic swelling were found to be at an increased risk of relapse after the initial steroid administration.
short-term effects of unilateral lesion of the primary motor cortex (m1) on ipsilesional hand dexterity in adult macaque monkeys infant monkeys were subjected to unilateral lesions of the motor cortex (mainly its hand representation). after maturation, they showed normal use of the contralateral hand for global grip movements. however, as compared with the ipsilateral hand, precision grip tasks requiring relatively independent finger movements were performed with less dexterity, particularly if adjustments of the wrist position were necessary. the purpose of this study was to investigate mechanisms which may be responsible for the rather well, although not complete, preservation of manipulative behaviour of these adult monkeys. to this end, the hand representations were mapped bilaterally with intracortical microstimulation in the mature monkeys, and the dexterity of both hands assessed quantitatively in a precision grip task. the behavioural effects of reversible inactivations of the primary (m1) and supplementary (sma) motor cortical areas were then tested. the following were found. (i) the hand contralateral to the lesion exhibited subtle but significant dexterity deficits, as compared with the ipsilateral hand; the deficit was essentially for complex movements requiring dissociation of the thumb–index finger pinch from the other digits, involving also an arm rotation. (ii) reversible inactivation of the m1 hand representation in the intact hemisphere dramatically impaired dexterity of the opposite hand without affecting the ipsilateral hand (contralateral to the early lesion). (iii) a relatively complete hand representation was found to occupy a new territory, medial to the old lesion. (iv) the role of this new displaced representation was crucial for the preserved dexterity of the opposite hand, as evidenced by its functional inactivation. in contrast, inactivation of both sma cortices did not interfere with the manipulative behaviour. it is thus concluded that the preserved functional capacity of manipulations with the hand opposite the early lesion can be essentially attributed to a cortical reorganization around the old lesion. under the present experimental conditions, contributions from either the sma or the intact m1 appear not to be crucial.
evaluation of group genetic ancestry of populations from philadelphia and dakar in the context of sex-biased admixture in the americas we have analyzed 247 brazilian mtdnas for hypervariable segment (hvs)-i and selected restriction fragment-length-polymorphism sites, to assess their ancestry in different continents. the total sample showed nearly equal amounts of native american, african, and european matrilineal genetic contribution but with regional differences within brazil. the mtdna pool of present-day brazilians clearly reflects the imprints of the early portuguese colonization process (involving directional mating), as well as the recent immigrant waves (from europe) of the last century. the subset of 99 mtdnas from the southeastern region encompasses nearly all mtdna haplogroups observed in the total brazilian sample; for this regional subset, hvs-ii was analyzed, providing, in particular, some novel details of the african mtdna phylogeny.
brief report: regression timing and associated features in mecp2 duplication syndrome autism diagnostic observation schedule (ados) modules 1–3 item and domain total distributions were reviewed for 1,630 assessments of children aged 14 months to 16 years with an autism spectrum disorder (asd) or with heterogeneous non-spectrum disorders. children were divided by language level and age to yield more homogeneous cells. items were chosen that best differentiated between diagnoses and were arranged into domains on the basis of multi-factor item-response analysis. reflecting recent research, the revised algorithm now consists of two new domains, social affect and restricted, repetitive behaviors (rrb), combined to one score to which thresholds are applied, resulting in generally improved predictive value.
effect of antipyretic therapy on mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis receiving mechanical ventilation treatment sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock represent increasingly severe systemic inflammatory responses to infection. sepsis is common in the aging population, and it disproportionately affects patients with cancer and underlying immunosuppression. in its most severe form, sepsis causes multiple organ dysfunction that can produce a state of chronic critical illness characterized by severe immune dysfunction and catabolism. much has been learnt about the pathogenesis of sepsis at the molecular, cell, and intact organ level. despite uncertainties in hemodynamic management and several treatments that have failed in clinical trials, investigational therapies increasingly target sepsis induced organ and immune dysfunction. outcomes in sepsis have greatly improved overall, probably because of an enhanced focus on early diagnosis and fluid resuscitation, the rapid delivery of effective antibiotics, and other improvements in supportive care for critically ill patients. these improvements include lung protective ventilation, more judicious use of blood products, and strategies to reduce nosocomial infections.
prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation in sle inpatients: chinese experience in 1982, the diagnostic and therapeutic criteria committee of the american college of rheumatology (acr)published revised criteria for the classification of systemiclupus erythematosus (sle) (1). during the ensuing decade several investigators, including drs. graham hughes and donato alarcon-segovia, among others, have described the presence and clinical associations or antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with sle, as well as the occurrence of theprimary antiphospholipid syndrome (2-5). in 1992, piette and colleagues suggested that the acr revised criteria be reevaluated in light of the above discoveries (6).
psychometric properties of the anxiety inventory for respiratory disease in patients with copd in china reliability coefficients often take the form of intraclass correlation coefficients. in this article, guidelines are given for choosing among six different forms of the intraclass correlation for reliability studies in which n target are rated by k judges. relevant to the choice of the coefficient are the appropriate statistical model for the reliability and the application to be made of the reliability results. confidence intervals for each of the forms are reviewed.
genotype-by-environment interactions influencing the emergence of rpos mutations in escherichia coli populations the sigma(s) subunit of rna polymerase (encoded by the rpos gene) is a master regulator in a complex regulatory network that governs the expression of many stationary-phase-induced and osmotically regulated genes in escherichia coli. rpos expression is itself osmotically regulated by a mechanism that operates at the posttranscriptional level. cells growing at high osmolarity already exhibit increased levels of sigma(s) during the exponential phase of growth. osmotic induction of rpos can be triggered by addition of nacl or sucrose and is alleviated by glycine betaine. stimulation of rpos translation and a change in the half-life of sigma(s) from 3 to 50 min both contribute to osmotic induction. experiments with lacz fusions inserted at different positions within the rpos gene indicate that an element required for sigma(s) degradation is encoded between nucleotides 379 and 742 of the rpos coding sequence.
real-time human action recognition using individual body part locations and local joints structure recently released depth cameras provide effective estimation of 3d positions of skeletal joints in temporal sequences of depth maps. in this work, we propose an efficient yet effective method to recognize human actions based on the positions of joints. first, the body skeleton is decomposed in a set of kinematic chains, and the position of each joint is expressed in a locally defined reference system which makes the coordinates invariant to body translations and rotations. a multi-part bag-of-poses approach is then defined, which permits the separate alignment of body parts through a nearest-neighbor classification. experiments conducted on the florence 3d action dataset and the msr daily activity dataset show promising results.
a derivative-free trust-funnel method for equality-constrained nonlinear optimization abstract.we briefly describe the contents of the author’s phd thesis (see colson 2003) discussed on july 2003 at the university of namur (belgium) and supervised by philippe l. toint. the contributions presented in this thesis are the development of trust-region methods for solving two particular classes of mathematical programs, namely derivative-free optimization (dfo) problems and nonlinear bilevel programming problems. the thesis is written in english and is available via the author.
nutrient regulation of pkcε is mediated by leucine, not insulin, in skeletal muscle background the rate of protein synthesis is diminished after chronic alcohol consumption through changes in both mrna translation initiation and elongation. it remains unknown how long adverse effects of alcohol on protein synthesis persist after withdrawal from ethanol.   methods we examined the effect of removal of alcohol from the diet of rats for 72 hr after chronic alcohol exposure (16 weeks) on rates of protein synthesis and potential mechanisms for controlling mrna translation in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. rates of protein synthesis were measured after intravenous infusion of [3h]-l-phenylalanine. the formation of active eukaryotic initiation factor (eif)4e.eif4g complex, the cellular content of eukaryotic elongation factor (eef)1a and eef2, and the phosphorylation state of eef2 and s6k1 were measured in each tissue.   results withdrawal of alcohol from the diet restored protein synthesis in heart and skeletal muscle to values obtained in pair-fed control rats not exposed to alcohol. however, the organ weight and protein content per muscle was not affected by withdrawal of alcohol from the diet. in both heart and skeletal muscle, the restoration of protein synthesis correlated with reversal of defects in the formation of active eif4e.eif4g complex and eef1a content. myocardial eef2 content was also restored to control values after withdrawal of alcohol from the diet. in the gastrocnemius, there was a decrease in the cellular content of eef2. the lower eif2 content may have been counterbalanced by an increased activity of eef2 through a reduction in the phosphorylation state of eef2 allowing protein synthesis to proceed unimpeded.   conclusions these studies indicate that changes in protein metabolism observed during chronic alcohol intake are reversible and do not, at this stage, represent an irreversible change in cardiac or skeletal muscle.
tracking molecular recognition at the atomic level with a new protein scaffold based on the ob-fold hot spots constitute a small fraction of protein–protein interface residues, yet they account for a large fraction of the binding affinity. based on our previous method (kfc), we present two new methods (kfc2a and kfc2b) that outperform other methods at hot spot prediction. a number of improvements were made in developing these new methods. first, we created a training data set that contained a similar number of hot spot and non‐hot spot residues. in addition, we generated 47 different features, and different numbers of features were used to train the models to avoid over‐fitting. finally, two feature combinations were selected: one (used in kfc2a) is composed of eight features that are mainly related to solvent accessible surface area and local plasticity; the other (kfc2b) is composed of seven features, only two of which are identical to those used in kfc2a. the two models were built using support vector machines (svm). the two kfc2 models were then tested on a mixed independent test set, and compared with other methods such as robetta, foldef, hotpoint, minerva, and kfc. kfc2a showed the highest predictive accuracy for hot spot residues (true positive rate: tpr = 0.85); however, the false positive rate was somewhat higher than for other models. kfc2b showed the best predictive accuracy for hot spot residues (true positive rate: tpr = 0.62) among all methods other than kfc2a, and the false positive rate (fpr = 0.15) was comparable with other highly predictive methods. proteins 2011. © 2011 wiley‐liss, inc.
abscisic acid deficiency antagonizes high-temperature inhibition of disease resistance through enhancing nuclear accumulation of resistance proteins snc1 and rps4 in arabidopsis[c][w] the current challenge, now that two plant genomes have been sequenced, is to assign a function to the increasing number of predicted genes. in arabidopsis, approximately 55% of genes can be assigned a putative function, however, less than 8% of these have been assigned a function by direct experimental evidence. to identify these functions, many genes will have to undergo comprehensive analyses, which will include the production of chimeric transgenes for constitutive or inducible ectopic expression, for antisense or dominant negative expression, for subcellular localization studies, for promoter analysis, and for gene complementation studies. the production of such transgenes is often hampered by laborious conventional cloning technology that relies on restriction digestion and ligation. with the aim of providing tools for high throughput gene analysis, we have produced a gateway-compatible agrobacterium sp. binary vector system that facilitates fast and reliable dna cloning. this collection of vectors is freely available, for noncommercial purposes, and can be used for the ectopic expression of genes either constitutively or inducibly. the vectors can be used for the expression of protein fusions to the aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein and to the β-glucuronidase protein so that the subcellular localization of a protein can be identified. they can also be used to generate promoter-reporter constructs and to facilitate efficient cloning of genomic dna fragments for complementation experiments. all vectors were derived from pcambia t-dna cloning vectors, with the exception of a chemically inducible vector, for agrobacterium sp.-mediated transformation of a wide range of plant species.

neuroblastoma, body mass index, and survival purpose and methods: based on preliminary experience, there was a need for modifications and clarifications in the international neuroblastoma staging system (inss) and international neuroblastoma response criteria (inrc). in 1988, a proposal was made to establish an internationally accepted staging system for neuroblastoma, as well as consistent criteria for confirming the diagnosis and determining response to therapy (brodeur gm, et al: j clin oncol 6:1874-1881, 1988). a meeting was held to review experience with the inss and inrc and to revise or clarify the language and intent of the originally proposed criteria. substantial changes included a redefinition of the midline, restrictions on age and bone marrow involvement for stage 4s, and the recommendation that meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mibg) scanning be implemented for evaluating the extent of disease. other modifications and clarifications of the inss and inrc are presented. in addition, the criteria for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma were modified. ...
worldwide freshwater fish homogenization is driven by a few widespread non-native species there is growing interest in large-scale approaches to ecology, for both plants and animals. in particular, macroecological studies enable examination of the patterns and determinants of species richness of a variety of groups of organism throughout the world, which might have important implications for prediction and mitigation of the consequences of global change. here, we provide richness data for freshwater fishes, which, with more than 13,000 described species, comprise a quarter of all vertebrate species. we conducted an extensive literature survey of native, non-native (exotic), and endemic freshwater fish species richness. the resulting database, called fish-sprich, contains data from more than 400 bibliographic sources including published papers, books, and grey literature sources. fish-sprich contains richness values at the river basin grain for 1,054 river basins covering more than 80% of the earth’s continental surface. this database is currently the most comprehensive global database of native, non-native and endemic freshwater fish richness available at the river basin grain.
the impact of a community awareness strategy on caregiver treatment seeking behaviour and use of artemether-lumefantrine for febrile children in rural kenya using data from india, we estimate the relationship between household wealth and children’s school enrollment. we proxy wealth by constructing a linear index from asset ownership indicators, using principal-components analysis to derive weights. in indian data this index is robust to the assets included, and produces internally coherent results. state-level results correspond well to independent data on per capita output and poverty. to validate the method and to show that the asset index predicts enrollments as accurately as expenditures, or more so, we use data sets from indonesia, pakistan, and nepal that contain information on both expenditures and assets. the results show large, variable wealth gaps in children’s enrollment across indian states. on average a “rich” child is 31 percentage points more likely to be enrolled than a “poor” child, but this gap varies from only 4.6 percentage points in kerala to 38.2 in uttar pradesh and 42.6 in bihar.
population coding and decoding in a neural field: a computational study coarse codes are widely used throughout the brain to encode sensory and motor variables. methods designed to interpret these codes, such as population vector analysis, are either inefficient, i.e., the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possible variance, or biologically implausible, like maximum likelihood. moreover, these methods attempt to compute a scalar or vector estimate of the encoded variable. neurons are faced with a similar estimation problem. they must read out the responses of the presynaptic neurons, but, by contrast, they typically encode the variable with a further population code rather than as a scalar. we show how a non-linear recurrent network can be used to perform these estimation in an optimal way while keeping the estimate in a coarse code format. this work suggests that lateral connections in the cortex may be involved in cleaning up uncorrelated noise among neurons representing similar variables.
objective measures of physical activity and cardiometabolic and endocrine biomarkers blood pressure in children has consistently been related to adult blood pressure, with implications for long-term prevention of cardiovascular disease. the epidemic of obesity in children has resulted in corresponding increases in childhood blood pressure. in this paper, the authors develop norms for childhood blood pressure among normal-weight children (body mass index <85th percentile based on centers for disease control and prevention guidelines) as a function of age, sex, and height, using data from 49,967 children included in the database of the national high blood pressure education program working group on high blood pressure in children and adolescents (the pediatric task force). the authors considered three types of models for pediatric blood pressure data, including polynomial regression, restricted cubic splines, and quantile regression, with the latter providing the best fit. the sex-specific norms presented here are a nonlinear function of both age and height and are generally slightly lower than previously developed norms based on pediatric task force data including both normal-weight and overweight children.
market feedback does not eliminate biases in the perception of independence barberis et al. (j. financial econ. 49 (1998) 307), construct a model in which investors use the prevalence of past trend reversals as an indicator of the likelihood of future reversals. while such ‘‘regime-shifting’’ beliefs are consistent with a variety of psychological theories, other contrary predictions are consistent with the same theories. we report two experiments with mba-student participants that strongly support the existence of regime-shifting beliefs. we conclude that regime-shifting models can provide a useful framework for understanding market anomalies, including underreactions to earnings changes and overreactions to longterm earnings trends. r 2002 published by elsevier science b.v. jel classification: c91; g12; m41
cerebellar granule cell death induced by aluminum effects of glutamate and kainate on the intracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) in a large population (several thousand) of dissociated cerebellar granule cell neurons were evaluated using a flow-cytometer and a combination of two fluorescent dyes, fluo-3-am for estimating [ca2+]i and ethidium bromide for removing neurons that had compromised membranes from the cell population examined. the number of neurons responding to glutamate or kainate in augmenting the fluo-3 fluorescence increased in a dose-dependent manner. the number of neurons responding to kainate was much greater than that to glutamate. cnqx, a blocker of non-nmda receptors, completely blocked the response elicited by kainate while the complete blockade of this glutamate-induced response was made by a combination of mk-801, a nmda receptor blocker, and cnqx. nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, decreased the number of neurons responding to glutamate and kainate, suggesting involvement of voltage-dependent calcium channels. these results indicate that the flow-cytometric measurement of glutamate and kainate responses has the potential to provide answers to such questions as what percentage of the population of neurons respond to these amino acids and what is the resulting distribution of [ca2+]i.
a novel synthetic smoothened antagonist transiently inhibits pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts in a mouse model a smooth(ened) path to drug resistance the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway has emerged as a key contributor to the growth of medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. gdc-0449, a drug that ramps down this signaling pathway by binding to the hh pathway component smoothened, was recently shown to induce rapid and dramatic tumor regression in a patient with metastatic medulloblastoma, but the tumor eventually developed resistance to the drug. yauch et al. (p. 572, published online 3 september) show that resistance arose because the tumor acquired a mutation in smoothened that disrupts binding of the drug. identification of this resistance mechanism may facilitate the design of next-generation drugs for this type of cancer. a mutation that prevents binding of a promising drug lead to its target protein confers resistance in a human brain tumor. the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway is inappropriately activated in certain human cancers, including medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. gdc-0449, a drug that inhibits hh signaling by targeting the serpentine receptor smoothened (smo), has produced promising anti-tumor responses in early clinical studies of cancers driven by mutations in this pathway. to evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a medulloblastoma patient who had relapsed after an initial response to gdc-0449, we determined the mutational status of hh signaling genes in the tumor after disease progression. we identified an amino acid substitution at a conserved aspartic acid residue of smo that had no effect on hh signaling but disrupted the ability of gdc-0449 to bind smo and suppress this pathway. a mutation altering the same amino acid also arose in a gdc-0449–resistant mouse model of medulloblastoma. these findings show that acquired mutations in a serpentine receptor with features of a g protein–coupled receptor can serve as a mechanism of drug resistance in human cancer.

interval pattern concept lattice as a classifier ensemble personal credit scoring is the application of financial risk forecasting. it becomes an even important task as financial institutions have been experiencing serious competition and challenges. in this paper, the techniques used for credit scoring are summarized and classified and the new method—ensemble learning model is introduced. this article also discusses some problems in current study. it points out that changing the focus from static credit scoring to dynamic behavioral scoring and maximizing revenue by decreasing the type i and type ii error are two issues in current study. it also suggested that more complex models cannot always been applied to actual situation. therefore, how to use the assessment models widely and improve the prediction accuracy is the main task for future research.
detection of small rnas in bordetella pertussis and identification of a novel repeated genetic element bordetella pertussis, bordetella parapertussis and bordetella bronchiseptica are closely related gram-negative β-proteobacteria that colonize the respiratory tracts of mammals. b. pertussis is a strict human pathogen of recent evolutionary origin and is the primary etiologic agent of whooping cough. b. parapertussis can also cause whooping cough, and b. bronchiseptica causes chronic respiratory infections in a wide range of animals. we sequenced the genomes of b. bronchiseptica rb50 (5,338,400 bp; 5,007 predicted genes), b. parapertussis 12822 (4,773,551 bp; 4,404 genes) and b. pertussis tohama i (4,086,186 bp; 3,816 genes). our analysis indicates that b. parapertussis and b. pertussis are independent derivatives of b. bronchiseptica-like ancestors. during the evolution of these two host-restricted species there was large-scale gene loss and inactivation; host adaptation seems to be a consequence of loss, not gain, of function, and differences in virulence may be related to loss of regulatory or control functions.

3d tracker-level fusion for robust rgb-d tracking we present a real-time rgb-d object tracker which manages occlusions and scale changes in a wide variety of scenarios. its accuracy matches, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art algorithms for precision and it far exceeds most in speed. we build our algorithm on the existing colour-only kcf tracker which uses the ‘kernel trick’ to extend correlation filters for fast tracking. we fuse colour and depth cues as the tracker’s features and exploit the depth data to both adjust a given target’s scale and to detect and manage occlusions in such a way as to maintain real-time performance, exceeding on average 35fps when benchmarked on two publicly available datasets. we make our easy-to-extend modularised code available to other researchers.
phylogenetic reconstruction of orthology, paralogy, and conserved synteny for dog and human the relationships between synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates and between synonymous rate and codon usage bias are important to our understanding of the roles of mutation and selection in the evolution of drosophila genes. previous studies used approximate estimation methods that ignore codon bias. in this study we reexamine those relationships using maximum-likelihood methods to estimate substitution rates, which accommodate the transition/transversion rate bias and codon usage bias. we compiled a sample of homologous dna sequences at 83 nuclear loci from drosophila melanogaster and at least one other species of drosophila. our analysis was consistent with previous studies in finding that synonymous rates were positively correlated with nonsynonymous rates. our analysis differed from previous studies, however, in that synonymous rates were unrelated to codon bias. we therefore conducted a simulation study to investigate the differences between approaches. the results suggested that failure to properly account for multiple substitutions at the same site and for biased codon usage by approximate methods can lead to an artifactual correlation between synonymous rate and codon bias. implications of the results for translational selection are discussed.
detecting the potential sympatric range and niche divergence between asian endemic ungulates of procapra aim  various techniques model a species’ niche and potential distribution by comparing the environmental conditions of occurrence localities with those of the overall study region (via a background or pseudoabsence sample). here, we examine how changes in the extent of the study region (ignored or under-appreciated in most studies) affect models of two rodents, nephelomys caracolus and nephelomys meridensis.    location  north-central south america.    methods  we used maxent to model the species' potential distributions via two methods of defining the study region. in method 1 (typical of most studies to date), we calibrated the model in a large study region that included the ranges of both species. in method 2, we calibrated the model using a smaller study region surrounding the localities of the focal species, and then applied it to the larger region. because the study region of method 1 is likely to include areas of suitable conditions that are unoccupied because of dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions, this approach is prone to overfitting to conditions found near the occupied localities. in contrast, method 2 should avoid such problems but may require further assumptions (‘clamping’ in maxent) to make predictions for areas with environmental conditions beyond those found in the smaller study region. for each method, we calculated several measures of geographic interpredictivity between predictions for the species (cross-species auc, cross-species omission rate, and proportional geographic overlap).    results  compared with method 1, method 2 revealed a larger predicted area for each species, less concentrated around known localities (especially for n. caracolus). it also led to higher cross-species auc values, lower cross-species omission rates and higher proportions of geographic overlap. clamping was minimal and occurred primarily in regions unlikely to be suitable.    main conclusions  method 2 led to more realistic predictions and higher estimates of niche conservatism. conclusions reached by many studies depend on the selection of an appropriate study region. although detailed information regarding dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions will typically be difficult to obtain, consideration of coarse distributional patterns, topography and vegetational zones often should permit delimitation of a much more reasonable study region than the extremely large ones currently in common use.
novel methods for reflective symmetry detection in scanned 3d models we present a clean algorithm for determining whether a ray intersects a triangle. the algorithm translates the origin of the ray and then changes the base of that vector which yields a vector (t u v)t, where t is the distance to the plane in which the triangle lies and (u, v) represents the coordinates inside the triangle.one advantage of this method is that the plane equation need not be computed on the fly nor be stored, which can amount to significant memory savings for triangle meshes. as we found our method to be comparable in speed to previous methods, we believe it is the fastest ray/triangle intersection routine for triangles which do not have precomputed plane equations.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis. progressive tissue fibrosis can compromise epithelial function resulting in organ failure. appreciating evidence suggests that fibroblasts provide fibrogenic collagens during such injury. we further tested this notion by attempting to reduce the physiologic consequences of organ fibrosis through the selective killing of fibroblasts at sites of injury. here, we report the conditional reduction of tissue fibroblasts using the coding sequence for herpesvirus thymidine kinase (deltatk) put under the control of a cell-specific promoter from the gene encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). transgenic fibroblasts from mice carrying fsp1.deltatk minigenes expressed thymidine kinase concordantly with native fsp1 and, compared to transgenic epithelium, were selectively susceptible to the lethal effects of nucleoside analogs either in culture or during experimental renal fibrosis. the numbers of fibroblasts in fibrogenic kidney tissue were reduced on exposure to nucleoside analogs as was the degree of type i collagen deposition and the extent of fibrosis. fibroblast reduction following the stress of dna chain termination highlights the important contribution of cell division during fibrogenesis. our findings convey a proof of principle regarding the importance of fsp1(+) fibroblasts in fibrosis as well as providing a new approach to treating the relentless scarification of tissue.
immigrant latino neighborhoods and mortality among infants born to mexican-origin latina women objectives the assessment of the adequacy of prenatal care utilization is heavily shaped by the way in which utilization is measured. although it is widely used, the current major index of utilization, the kessner/institute of medicine index, has not been subjected to systematic examination. this paper provides such an examination.   methods data from the 1980 national natality survey are used to disaggregate the components of the kessner index for detailed analysis. an alternative two-part index, the adequacy of prenatal care utilization index, is proposed that combines independent assessments of the timing of prenatal care initiation and the frequency of visits received after initiation.   results the kessner index is seriously flawed. it is heavily weighted toward timing of prenatal care initiation does not distinguish timing of initiation from poor subsequent utilization, inaccurately measures utilization for full- or post-term pregnancies, and lacks sufficient documentation for consistent computer programming.   conclusions the adequacy of prenatal care utilization index offers a more accurate and comprehensive set of measures of prenatal care utilization than the kessner index.
forging a link between mentoring and collaboration: a new training model for implementation science objectives we studied 5 members of the national network consortium on tobacco control in priority populations. these networks, which consist of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, targeted lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons; asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islanders; american indians and alaska natives; african americans; and persons with low socioeconomic status, respectively.   methods we used statistical network analysis modeling to examine collaboration among these national networks in 2007.   results network size and composition varied, but all 5 networks had extensive interorganizational collaboration. location and work area were significant predictors of collaboration among network members in all 5 networks. organizations were more likely to collaborate with their network's lead agency; collaborations with other agencies were more likely if they were geographically close. collaboration was perceived to be important for achieving the goals of the national network.   conclusions the similarity of collaboration patterns across the 5 networks suggests common underlying partnership formation processes. statistical network modeling promises to be a useful tool for understanding how public health systems such as networks and coalitions can be used to improve the nation's health.
using gis mapping of the extent of nearshore rocky reefs to estimate the abundance and reproductive output of important fishery species networks of marine reserves are increasingly a major component of many ecosystem-based management plans designed to conserve biodiversity, protect the structure and function of ecosystems, and rebuild and sustain fisheries. there is a growing need for scientific guidance in the design of network-wide monitoring programs to evaluate the efficacy of reserves at meeting their conservation and management goals. here, we present an evaluation of the channel islands reserve network, which was established in 2003 off the coast of southern california. this reserve network spans a major environmental and biogeographic gradient, making it a challenge to assess network-wide responses of many species. using fish community structure data from a long-term, large-scale monitoring program, we first identified persistent geographic patterns of community structure and the scale at which sites should be grouped for analysis. fish communities differed most among islands with densities of individual species varying from 3- to 250-fold. habitat structure differed among islands but not based on reserve status. across the network, we found that, after 5 years, species targeted by fishing had higher densities (1.5×) and biomass (1.8×) inside reserves, whereas nontargeted species showed no significant differences. examining trophic groups, piscivore and carnivore biomass was significantly greater inside reserves (1.8× and 1.3× more, respectively), whereas the biomass of planktivores and herbivores was similar inside and out. a framework for incorporating biogeographic variation into reserve network assessments is critical as we move from the evaluation of single reserves to networks of reserves.
the conversion to metered-dose inhaler with valved holding chamber to administer inhaled albuterol: a pediatric hospital experience. the aim of this study was to compare albuterol delivery in a neonatal ventilated lung model, using three delivery methods: 1) jet nebulizer; 2) chlorofluorocarbon‐pressurized metered dose inhaler (cfc‐mdi) actuated into an ace® spacer; and 3) hydrofluoroalkane‐pressurized mdi (hfa‐mdi) actuated into an ace® spacer. the bench model consisted of a mechanically ventilated infant test lung with ventilator settings to simulate a very low birth weight neonate with moderate lung disease. albuterol solution (0.5%) was nebulized at the humidifier and temperature port, 125 cm and 30 cm from the y‐piece, respectively. albuterol metered dose inhalers (mdis) were actuated into an ace® spacer that was tested in two positions: 1) inline between the endotracheal (et) tube and the y‐piece; and 2) attached to the et tube and administered by manual ventilation. albuterol was collected on a filter at the distal end of the et tube and was quantitatively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography.
a computational analysis of cell-mediated compaction and collagen remodeling in tissue-engineered heart valves. understanding collagen and stress fiber remodeling is essential for the development of engineered tissues with good functionality. these processes are complex, highly interrelated, and occur over different time scales. as a result, excessive computational costs are required to computationally predict the final organization of these fibers in response to dynamic mechanical conditions. in this study, an analytical approximation of a stress fiber remodeling evolution law was derived. a comparison of the developed technique with the direct numerical integration of the evolution law showed relatively small differences in results, and the proposed method is one to two orders of magnitude faster.
duplicate detection in adverse drug reaction surveillance abstractobjective: the database of adverse drug reactions (adrs) held by the uppsala monitoring centre on behalf of the 47 countries of the world health organization (who) collaborating programme for international drug monitoring contains nearly two million reports. it is the largest database of this sort in the world, and about 35 000 new reports are added quarterly. the task of trying to find new drug–adr signals has been carried out by an expert panel, but with such a large volume of material the task is daunting. we have developed a flexible, automated procedure to find new signals with known probability difference from the background data. method: data mining, using various computational approaches, has been applied in a variety of disciplines. a bayesian confidence propagation neural network (bcpnn) has been developed which can manage large data sets, is robust in handling incomplete data, and may be used with complex variables. using information theory, such a tool is ideal for finding drug–adr combinations with other variables, which are highly associated compared to the generality of the stored data, or a section of the stored data. the method is transparent for easy checking and flexible for different kinds of search.    results: using the bcpnn, some time scan examples are given which show the power of the technique to find signals early (captopril–coughing) and to avoid false positives where a common drug and adrs occur in the database (digoxin–acne; digoxin–rash). a routine application of the bcpnn to a quarterly update is also tested, showing that 1004 suspected drug–adr combinations reached the 97.5% confidence level of difference from the generality. of these, 307 were potentially serious adrs, and of these 53 related to new drugs. twelve of the latter were not recorded in the cd editions of the physician's desk reference ormartindale's extra pharmacopoea and did not appear in reactions weekly online.   conclusion: the results indicate that the bcpnn can be used in the detection of significant signals from the data set of the who programme on international drug monitoring. the bcpnn will be an extremely useful adjunct to the expert assessment of very large numbers of spontaneously reported adrs.
smoking and other drug characteristics of aboriginal and non-aboriginal prisoners in australia regression methods were used to select and score 12 items from the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey (sf-36) to reproduce the physical component summary and mental component summary scales in the general us population (n=2,333). the resulting 12-item short-form (sf-12) achieved multiple r squares of 0.911 and 0.918 in predictions of the sf-36 physical component summary and sf-36 mental component summary scores, respectively. scoring algorithms from the general population used to score 12-item versions of the two components (physical components summary and mental component summary) achieved r squares of 0.905 with the sf-36 physical component summary and 0.938 with sf-36 mental component summary when cross-validated in the medical outcomes study. test-retest (2-week)correlations of 0.89 and 0.76 were observed for the 12-item physical component summary and the 12-item mental component summary, respectively, in the general us population (n=232). twenty cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of empirical validity previously published for the 36-item short-form scales and summary measures were replicated for the 12-item physical component summary and the 12-item mental component summary, including comparisons between patient groups known to differ or to change in terms of the presence and seriousness of physical and mental conditions, acute symptoms, age and aging, self-reported 1-year changes in health, and recovery for depression. in 14 validity tests involving physical criteria, relative validity estimates for the 12-item physical component summary ranged from 0.43 to 0.93 (median=0.67) in comparison with the best 36-item short-form scale. relative validity estimates for the 12-item mental component summary in 6 tests involving mental criteria ranged from 0.60 to 107 (median=0.97) in relation to the best 36-item short-form scale. average scores for the 2 summary measures, and those for most scales in the 8-scale profile based on the 12-item short-form, closely mirrored those for the 36-item short-form, although standard errors were nearly always larger for the 12-item short-form.
object recognition by learning informative, biologically inspired visual features appropriate datasets are required at all stages of object recognition research, including learning visual models of object and scene categories, detecting and localizing instances of these models in images, and evaluating the performance of recognition algorithms. current datasets are lacking in several respects, and this paper discusses some of the lessons learned from existing efforts, as well as innovative ways to obtain very large and diverse annotated datasets. it also suggests a few criteria for gathering future datasets.
distributed training of deep neural networks: theoretical and practical limits of parallel scalability caffe provides multimedia scientists and practitioners with a clean and modifiable framework for state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and a collection of reference models. the framework is a bsd-licensed c++ library with python and matlab bindings for training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models efficiently on commodity architectures. caffe fits industry and internet-scale media needs by cuda gpu computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single k40 or titan gpu (approx 2 ms per image). by separating model representation from actual implementation, caffe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments. caffe is maintained and developed by the berkeley vision and learning center (bvlc) with the help of an active community of contributors on github. it powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia.
implementation, validation and profiling of a genetic algorithm for molecular conformational optimization computer simulations of simple exact lattice models are an aid in the study of protein folding process; they have sometimes resulted in predictions experimentally proved. the contact interactions (ci) method is here proposed as a new algorithm for the conformational search in the low‐energy regions of protein chains modeled as copolymers of hydrophobic and polar monomers configured as self‐avoiding walks on square or cubic lattices. it may be regarded as an extension of the standard monte carlo method improved by the concept of cooperativity deriving from nonlocal contact interactions. a major difference with respect to other algorithms is that criteria for the acceptance of new conformations generated during the simulations are not based on the energy of the entire molecule, but cooling factors associated with each residue define regions of the model protein with higher or lower mobility. nine sequences of length ranging from 20 to 64 residues were used on the square lattice and 15 sequences of length ranging from 46 to 136 residues were used on the cubic lattice. the ci algorithm proved very efficient both in two and three dimensions, and allowed us to localize energy minima not localized by other searching algorithms described in the literature. use of this algorithm is not limited to the conformational search, because it allows the exploration of thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of model protein chains.
“pop-out” of targets modulated in luminance or colour: the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic uncertainty an adaptive psychometric procedure that places each trial at the current most probable bayesian estimate of threshold is described. the procedure takes advantage of the common finding that the human psychometric function is invariant in form when expressed as a function of log intensity. the procedure is simple, fast, and efficient, and may be easily implemented on any computer.
workshop on hybrid approaches to translation: overview and developments in this paper we give an overview of the 2007 evaluation campaign for the international workshop on spoken language translation (iwslt) 1 . as with previous evaluation campaigns, the primary focus of the workshop was the translation of spoken language in the travel domain. this year there were four language pairs; the translation of chinese, italian, arabic, and japanese into english. the input data consisted of the output of asr systems for read speech and clean text. the exceptions were the challenge task of the italian english language pair which used spontaneous speech asr outputs and transcriptions and the chinese english task which used only clean text. a new characteristic of this year’s evaluation campaign was an increased focus on the sharing of resources. participants were requested to submit the data and supplementary resources used in building their systems so that the other participants might be able to take advantage of the same resources. a second new characteristic this year was the focus on the human evaluation of systems. each primary run was judged in the human evaluation for every task using a straightforward ranking of systems. this year's workshop saw an increased participation over last year's workshop. this year 24 groups submitted runs to one or more of the tasks, compared to the 19 groups that submitted runs last year [1]. automatic and human evaluation were carried out to measure mt performance under each condition, asr system outputs for read speech, spontaneous travel dialogues, and clean text.

mimic peptides bonding specifically with the first and second extracellular loops of the cc chemokine receptor 5 derived from a phage display peptide library are potent inhibitors of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in this study, a nci-h1299 (non-small cell lung cancer, nsclc) and a normal lung cell line (small airway epithelial cells, saec) were used for the subtractive screening in vitro with a phage display-12 peptide library. after three rounds of panning, there was an obvious enrichment for the phages specifically binding to the nci-h1299 cells, and the output/input ratio of phages increased about 875-fold (from 0.4x10(4) to 3.5x10(6)). a group of peptides being capable of binding specifically to the nci-h1299 cells were obtained, and the affinity of these peptides to bind to the targeted cells and tissues was studied. through a cell-based elisa, immunocytochemical staining, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence, a m13 phage isolated and identified from the above screenings, and a synthetic peptide zs-1 (sequence ehmaltypfrpp) corresponded to the sequence of the surface protein of the m13 phage were demonstrated to be capable of binding to the tumor cell surfaces of nci-h1299 and a549 cell lines and biopsy specimens, but not to normal lungs tissue samples, other different cancer cells, or nontumor surrounding lung tissues. in conclusion, the peptide zs-1 may be a potential candidate of biomarker ligands used for targeted drug delivery in therapy of lung cancer.
correction: genetic variants in microrna machinery genes are associate with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss risk recent compelling evidence indicates that mutation, aberrant expression, and dysregulation of microrna (mirna) biogenesis are implicated in cancer development and progression. based on the important role of mirna biogenesis pathway in carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that genetic variations in this pathway genes may play a role as susceptibility factors for breast cancer. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the associations between 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in 14 genes involved in mirna biogenesis pathway and breast cancer risk in a case–control study of 559 korean breast cancer cases and 567 controls frequency-matched by age. in all women, 3 snps (ago1 rs595055, ago2 rs3864659, and p68 rs1991401) were significantly associated with breast cancer risk. in stratified analysis by menopausal status, altered risk associations were observed for 7 snps in postmenopausal breast cancer. when subjects were grouped by the number of high-risk genotypes, we found a progressive increase in gene-dosage effect (ptrend = 9.46e−7). the protective effects of ago2 rs3864659 and hiwi rs11060845 were more pronounced in progesterone receptor-positive (pr+) cancer than in progesterone receptor-negative (pr−) cancer (odds ratio (or), 0.50; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.30–0.84 vs. or, 0.94; 95% ci, 0.60–1.84; pheterogeneity = 0.04 and or, 0.57; 95% ci, 0.37–0.88 vs. or, 0.97; 95% ci, 0.65–1.44; pheterogeneity = 0.02, respectively), and the drosha rs644236 had stronger association with estrogen receptor-negative (er−) cancer than for estrogen receptor-positive (er+) cancer (or, 1.39; 95% ci, 1.08–1.78 vs. or, 1.05; 95% ci, 0.85–1.29; pheterogeneity = 0.04). our results suggest that genetic variants in mirna biogenesis pathway genes may be associated with breast cancer risk, and the modifiable effects might be different according to the menopausal status and hormone receptor status.

the effects of tio2 nanodot films with rgd immobilization on light-induced cell sheet technology the phenomenon of light-induced cell detachment is reported. mouse calvaria-derived, pre-osteoblastic (mc3t3-e1) cells were cultured on a tio(2) nanodot-coated quartz substrate. after 20 min of uv365 illumination, over 90% of the cells would detach from the surface. moreover, intact cell sheets could be obtained in the same way. it was found that the as-obtained cells showed good viability, and could be used for further culture processes and other applications. also, biocompatibility and safety characterizations indicated that the use of tio(2) nanodots and uv365 illumination was safe for such cell detachment. it is suggested that adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins play key roles in developing cell sheets and ensuring biocompatibility. the present light-induced cell detachment method demonstrates a promising way for rapid cell/cell sheet harvesting.
cross-cultural adaptation, reliability, and validity of the bicams in brazil background: cognitive impairment in ms impacts negatively on many patients at all disease stages and in all subtypes. full clinical cognitive assessment is expensive, requiring expert staff and special equipment. test versions and normative data are not available for all languages and cultures. objective: to recommend a brief cognitive assessment for multiple sclerosis (ms) that is optimized for small centers, with one or few staff members, who may not have neuropsychological training and constructed to maximize international use. methods: an expert committee of twelve members representing the main cultural groups that have so far contributed considerable data about ms cognitive dysfunction was convened. following exhaustive literature review, peer-reviewed articles were selected to cover a broad spectrum of cultures and scales that targeted cognitive domains vulnerable to ms. each was rated by two committee members and candidates scales were rated on psychometric qualities (reliability, validity, and sensitivity), international application, ease of administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. results: the committee recommended the symbol digit modalities test, if only 5 minutes was available, with the addition of the california verbal learning test – second edition and the brief visuospatial memory test – revised learning trials if a further 10 minutes could be allocated for testing. conclusions: a brief cognitive assessment for ms has been recommended. a validation protocol has been prepared for language groups and validation studies have commenced.
differences between the channels, currents and mechanisms of conduction slowing/block and accommodative processes in simulated cases of focal demyelinating neuropathies a model is presented that assumes a triaxial cable form, with separate nodal, paranodal, and internodal regions; a myelin sheath independent of the underlying internodal membrane; and a periaxonal conductance pathway. unlike previous coaxial-cable-equivalent models, this triaxial form allows inclusion of ionic channels in the internodal membrane. the model uses ionic channel dynamics for the mammal and amphibian derived from recent experimental studies. it reproduces conduction behavior seen in experimental and previous modeling efforts, as well as the depolarizing afterpotential described by several investigators, which may have significance in determining the behavior of the nerve fiber as multiple action potentials are conducted or as multiple stimuli are imposed. this afterpotential cannot be produced by the previous coaxial models. the influence of the characteristics of the myelin sheath, underlying internodal membrane, and the periaxonal conductance pathway on the behavior of the nerve fiber is explored.<<etx>>

online f-measure optimization the first of these questions is in the province of sensory physiology, and is the only one for which appreciable understanding has been achieved. this article will be concerned primarily with the second and third questions, which are still subject to a vast amount of speculation, and where the few relevant facts currently supplied by neurophysiology have not yet been integrated into an acceptable theory. with regard to the second question, two alternative positions have been maintained. the first suggests that storage of sensory information is in the form of coded representations or images, with some sort of one-to-one mapping between the sensory stimulus
allosteric regulation of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase by atp for nucleotide selection 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (erythro) and its threo isomer were synthesized and investigated for their inhibition of hiv reverse transcriptase from virus isolate u 937/htlv-iii. the erythro isomer was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction directed by (ra)n(dt)12-18 and the ki value was 0.0022 microm. the threo isomer was at least 100-fold less active. the inhibition was specific for dtmp incorporation, and dgmp incorporation using (rc)n(dg)12-18 as template/primer was not affected. the km value for dttp varied between 0.7 microm and 1.7 microm. reverse transcriptase from nine hiv isolates were tested for inhibition by the erythro isomer and only slight differences in sensitivity were observed.
cognitive testing for dementia is adversely affected by administration in a foreign location age-adjusted normative data are presented for persons over age 55 on the mattis dementia rating scale. additional adjustment for the effect of education on test performance is also provided. these data were collected as part of mayo's older americans normative studies (moans) in a continuing effort to develop age-appropriate norms for older persons on commonly used neuropsychological tests. the normative data presented here should prove more useful in characterizing the presence and severity of general cognitive dysfunction than currently available norms. limitations and unique features of moans normative data are also discussed.
overexpression of the barley nicotianamine synthase gene hvnas1 increases iron and zinc concentrations in rice grains mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (mas) are metal chelators that are produced in graminaceous plants in response to iron (fe) deficiency, but current evidence regarding secretion of mas during zinc (zn) deficiency is contradictory. our studies using hplc analysis showed that zn deficiency induces the synthesis and secretion of mas in barley plants. the levels of the hvnas1, hvnaat-a, hvnaat-b, hvids2 and hvids3 transcripts, which encode the enzymes involved in the synthesis of mas, were increased in zn-deficient roots. studies of the genes involved in the methionine cycle using microarray analysis showed that the transcripts of these genes were increased in both zn-deficient and fe-deficient barley roots, probably allowing the plant to meet its demand for methionine, a precursor in the synthesis of mas. in addition, hvnaat-b transcripts were detected in zn-deficient shoots, but not in those that were deficient in fe. increased synthesis of mas in zn-deficient barley was not due to a deficiency of fe, because zn-deficient barley accumulated more fe than did the control plants, ferritin transcripts were increased in zn-deficient plants, and zn deficiency promoted fe transport from root to shoot. moreover, analysis using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system (petis) confirmed that more 62zn(ii)-mas than 62zn2+ were absorbed by the roots of zn-deficient barley plants. these data suggest that the increased biosynthesis and secretion of mas arising from a shortage of zn are not due to an induced fe deficiency, and that secreted mas are effective in absorbing zn from the soil.
evaluating the relationship between competition and productivity within a native grassland 1 we measured competition intensity (ci) between herbaceous vegetation and tree seedlings (quercus macrocarpa and q. ellipsoidalis) along an experimental moisture–light gradient. contrasting theories were tested by comparing variation in competition intensity to changes in neighbour biomass and resource supply and demand.        2 ci based on survival was inversely correlated with net soil water supply (gross supply minus demand by herbaceous vegetation). ci was not positively correlated with either gross resource supply or neighbour biomass, contrary to predictions of grime's triangular model for plant strategies.        3 many of the inconsistencies and conflicting results that have characterized the recent literature on plant competition could be eliminated if changes in competition intensity along a resource gradient are compared with changes in net resource supply rather than changes in productivity or neighbour biomass.        4 tree seedling success in savannas and grasslands may be strongly influenced by the intensity of competition from herbaceous vegetation. factors that reduce soil water content are likely to increase competition intensity (and reduce seedling success) in these environments, while factors that increase soil water content will favour seedling success through decreased competition for water with herbaceous vegetation.
model-based analysis of her activation in cells co-expressing egfr, her2 and her3 erbb receptor activation is a complex process and is dependent upon the type and number of receptors expressed on a given cell. previous studies with defined combinations of erbb receptors expressed in mammalian cells have helped elucidate specific biological responses for many of the recognized gene products that serve as ligands for these receptors. however, no study has examined the binding of these ligands in a defined experimental system. to address this issue, the relative binding affinities of the egf domains of eleven erbb ligands were measured on six erbb receptor combinations using a soluble receptor‐ligand binding format. the erbb2/4 heterodimer was shown to bind all ligands tested with moderate to very high affinity. in contrast, erbb3 showed much more restrictive ligand binding specificity and measurable binding was observed only with heregulin, neuregulin2β, epiregulin and the synthetic heregulin/egf chimera, biregulin. these studies also revealed that erbb2 preferentially enhances ligand binding to erbb3 or erbb4 and to a lesser degree to erbb1.
molecular recognition of ccr5 by an hiv-1 gp120 v3 loop loops are the most variable regions of protein structure and are, in general, the least accurately predicted. their prediction has been approached in two ways, ab initio and database search. in recent years, it has been thought that ab initio methods are more powerful. in light of the continued rapid expansion in the number of known protein structures, we have re‐evaluated fread, a database search method and demonstrate that the power of database search methods may have been underestimated. we found that sequence similarity as quantified by environment specific substitution scores can be used to significantly improve prediction. in fact, fread performs appreciably better for an identifiable subset of loops (two thirds of shorter loops and half of the longer loops tested) than the ab initio methods of modeller, plop, and rapper. within this subset, fread's predictive ability is length independent, in general, producing results within 2å rmsd, compared to an average of over 10å for loop length 20 for any of the other tested methods. we also benchmarked the prediction protocols on a set of 212 loops from the model structures in casp 7 and 8. an extended version of fread is able to make predictions for 127 of these, it gives the best prediction of the methods tested in 61 of these cases. in examining fread's ability to predict in the model environment, we found that whole structure quality did not affect the quality of loop predictions. proteins 2010. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
first-in-human closed-chest transcatheter superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. femoral artery caliber or disease precludes vascular access in a significant minority of candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement or aortic endograft therapy.    we propose an alternative access route to the abdominal aorta for large-vessel introducer sheaths by direct puncture from the adjoining inferior vena cava (ivc). we reason that the veins are larger and more compliant than corresponding arteries, that venous decompression may avert hemorrhage in confined-space arterial perforation, and that acquired aorto-caval fistulas are not immediately life-threatening. we close the caval-aortic access tract using nitinol occluders. we also test intentional failure to close the caval-aortic access tract.
cognitive function in a general population of men and women: a cross sectional study in the european investigation of cancer–norfolk cohort (epic-norfolk) backgrounddespite the mmse's known flaws, it is still used extensively as both a screening instrument for dementia and a population measure of cognitive ability. the aim of this paper is to provide data on the distribution of mmse scores in a representative sample from the uk population and to compare it with an extended cognitive assessment (emse) which covers a wider range of cognitive domains and provides a wider range of difficulty levels.methodsthe mmse and the emse were administered to over 12,000 participants at the screening stage of the mrc cognitive function and ageing study (mrc cfas). mrc cfas is a multi-centre population-based study in england and wales with respondents aged 65 years and older.resultsnormative values on the mmse and emse are presented by age group, sex and level of education. there are very large differences between age groups, with smaller differences seen between the sexes and by level of education. the emse extends the scores at the high end of the ability range, but is no better than the mmse at differentiating between dementia and non-dementia.conclusionpopulation-derived norms are valuable for comparing an individual's score to the score that would be expected among the general population, given the individual's specific demographic characteristics.
macrophage-mediated neuroprotection and neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium. the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha recruits macrophages to sites of epithelial remodeling. we showed previously that mrna and protein levels of mip-1alpha in the olfactory epithelium (oe) increased significantly at 3 days after bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (obx). the first aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the absence of mip-1alpha on macrophage recruitment to the oe 3 days after obx in mip-1alpha(-/-) mice compared with c57bl/6 mice and to test whether chemokine function could be restored by mip-1alpha protein injection into mip-1alpha(-/-) mice. obx was performed on c57bl/6 and mip-1alpha(-/-) mice. the mice received six subcutaneous injections at 12-h intervals of either 10 mug/ml mip-1alpha protein in carrier or carrier only. macrophage recruitment was evaluated with antibodies to cd68 for all macrophages and f4/80 for activated macrophages. compared with c57bl/6 mice, at 3 days post-obx the numbers of cd68(+) and f4/80(+) macrophages were significantly lower in carrier-injected mip-1alpha(-/-) mice and were comparable in mip-1alpha protein-injected mip-1alpha(-/-) mice. the second aim was to determine the identity of genes regulated at 3 days post-obx in the oe of carrier-injected mip-1alpha(-/-) mice compared with carrier-injected c57bl/6 mice. total rna from the oe was hybridized to affymetrix microarrays. a number of chemokine-, cytokine-, and growth factor-related genes were significantly regulated in the mip-1alpha(-/-) mice and were restored in mip-1alpha protein-injected mip-1alpha(-/-) mice. the results illustrated that mip-1alpha played a key role in recruitment of macrophages to the oe and provided insight into the genomic regulation involved in oe remodeling.
detection of cardiovascular reactivity in speech in this paper we review recent developments in the methodology of non‐invasive finger arterial pressure measurement and the information about arterial flow that can be obtained from it. continuous measurement of finger pressure based on the volume‐clamp method was introduced in the early 1980s both for research purposes and for clinical medicine. finger pressure tracks intra‐arterial pressure but the pressure waves may differ systematically both in shape and magnitude. such bias can, at least partly, be circumvented by reconstruction of brachial pressure from finger pressure by using a general inverse anti‐resonance model correcting for the difference in pressure waveforms and an individual forearm cuff calibration. the modelflow method as implemented in the finometer computes an aortic flow waveform from peripheral arterial pressure by simulating a non‐linear three‐element model of the aortic input impedance. the methodology tracks fast changes in stroke volume (sv) during various experimental protocols including postural stress and exercise. if absolute values are required, calibration against a gold standard is needed. otherwise, modelflow‐measured sv is expressed as change from control with the same precision in tracking. beat‐to‐beat information on arterial flow offers important and clinically relevant information on the circulation beyond what can be detected by arterial pressure.
augmenting translation models with simulated acoustic confusions for improved spoken language translation translation into morphologically rich languages is an important but recalcitrant problem in mt. we present a simple and effective approach that deals with the problem in two phases. first, a discriminative model is learned to predict inflections of target words from rich source-side annotations. then, this model is used to create additional sentencespecific word- and phrase-level translations that are added to a standard translation model as “synthetic” phrases. our approach relies on morphological analysis of the target language, but we show that an unsupervised bayesian model of morphology can successfully be used in place of a supervised analyzer. we report significant improvements in translation quality when translating from english to russian, hebrew and swahili.
restrained whole body plethysmography for measure of strain-specific and allergen-induced airway responsiveness in conscious mice. because of the wide utilization of rodents as animal models in respiratory research and the limited data on measurements of respiratory input impedance (zrs) in small animals, we measured zrs between 0.25 and 9.125 hz at different levels (0-7 hpa) of positive end-expiratory pressure (peep) in mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits using a computer-controlled small-animal ventilator (schuessler tf and bates jht, ieee trans biomed eng 42: 860-866, 1995). zrs was fitted with a model, including a newtonian resistance (r) and inertance in series with a constant-phase tissue compartment characterized by tissue damping (gti) and elastance (hti) parameters. inertance was negligible in all cases. r, gti, and hti were normalized to body weight, yielding normalized r, gti, and hti (nhti), respectively. normalized r tended to decrease slightly with peep and increased with animal size. normalized gti had a minimal dependence on peep. nhti decreased with increasing peep, reaching a minimum at approximately 5 hpa in all species except mice. nhti was also higher in mice and rabbits compared with guinea pigs and rats at low peeps, which we conclude is probably due to a relatively smaller air space volume in mice and rabbits. our data also suggest that smaller rodents have proportionately wider airways than do larger animals. we conclude that a detailed, comparative study of respiratory system mechanics shows some evidence of structural differences among the lungs of various species but that, in general, rodent lungs obey scaling laws similar to those described in other species.
colorful image colorization we develop a fully automatic image colorization system. our approach leverages recent advances in deep networks, exploiting both low-level and semantic representations. as many scene elements naturally appear according to multimodal color distributions, we train our model to predict per-pixel color histograms. this intermediate output can be used to automatically generate a color image, or further manipulated prior to image formation. on both fully and partially automatic colorization tasks, we outperform existing methods. we also explore colorization as a vehicle for self-supervised visual representation learning.
differential impact of relative dose-intensity reductions in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma treated with r-chop21 or r-chop14 abstract in lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. in either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion p(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function p(t). the observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. for random samples of size n the product-limit (pl) estimate can be defined as follows: l...

short-term delayed recall of auditory verbal learning test is equivalent to long-term delayed recall for identifying amnestic mild cognitive impairment objectiveto examine whether 3 common memory tests differ statistically in terms of mild cognitive impairment (mci) discrimination rates and conversion rates to alzheimer disease. methodsa sample of 329 chinese patients who consulted our memory clinic in shanghai were tested using tasks including the auditory verbal learning test (avlt), the logical memory (lm) test, the rey-osterrieth complex figure test, and other neuropsychologic tasks. one hundred and forty-nine of these patients were tested again using the identical tests 2 years later. the diagnose standard of probable alzheimer disease is the same as the standard of the national institute of neurological and communicative diseases and stroke-alzheimer disease and related disorders association. resultsthe results of the mci discrimination rates are as follows: avlt-ii (51%) >avlt-i (31%) > complex figure test-ii (27%) >lm-i (21%)=lm-ii (21%) (i—immediate recall; ii—delayed recall). the mci group categorized based on lm-ii cutoff has a higher conversion rate per year (24%), but also a higher reversal rate and missed diagnosis rate, whereas the group based on avlt-ii cutoff has a lower conversion rate per year (12%), but also a lower reversal rate and missed diagnosis rate. conclusionsthe mci discrimination rate and the conversion rate among different episodic memory tests are differ considerably.
dopamine transporter/syntaxin 1a interactions regulate transporter channel activity and dopaminergic synaptic transmission the dense-bodies in the body wall muscle of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans function to anchor the actin thin filaments to the adjacent sarcolemma. one of the major components of the dense-bodies is the actin-binding protein alpha-actinin. to facilitate a genetic analysis of alpha-actinin, we have cloned a cdna encoding the nematode protein, identified its position on the nematode physical map, and developed a unique pcr based approach to test the position of the cloned gene relative to known genetic deletions. the peptide sequence deduced from the cdna shows that, apart from a few exceptional regions, the nematode protein shows strong similarity to other known alpha-actinins. its position on the genetic map shows that none of the known muscle affecting mutations identified in c. elegans are in this alpha-actinin gene. this gene has been given the name atn-1 (alpha-actinin-1).
cerebrospinal fluid alzheimer's biomarker profiles in cns infections clinical criteria for the diagnosis of alzheimer's disease include insidious onset and progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. there are no motor, sensory, or coordination deficits early in the disease. the diagnosis cannot be determined by laboratory tests. these tests are important primarily in identifying other possible causes of dementia that must be excluded before the diagnosis of alzheimer's disease may be made with confidence. neuropsychological tests provide confirmatory evidence of the diagnosis of dementia and help to assess the course and response to therapy. the criteria proposed are intended to serve as a guide for the diagnosis of probable, possible, and definite alzheimer's disease; these criteria will be revised as more definitive information becomes available.
impact of a multidisciplinary evaluation in pediatric patients with nocturnal monosymptomatic enuresis purpose the impact of the original international children's continence society terminology document on lower urinary tract function resulted in the global establishment of uniformity and clarity in the characterization of lower urinary tract function and dysfunction in children across multiple health care disciplines. the present document serves as a stand-alone terminology update reflecting refinement and current advancement of knowledge on pediatric lower urinary tract function.   materials and methods a variety of worldwide experts from multiple disciplines in the iccs leadership who care for children with lower urinary tract dysfunction were assembled as part of the standardization committee. a critical review of the previous iccs terminology document and the current literature was performed. in addition, contributions and feedback from the multidisciplinary iccs membership were solicited.   results following a review of the literature during the last 7 years the iccs experts assembled a new terminology document reflecting the current understanding of bladder function and lower urinary tract dysfunction in children using resources from the literature review, expert opinion and iccs member feedback.   conclusions the present iccs terminology document provides a current and consensus update to the evolving terminology and understanding of lower urinary tract function in children. for the complete document visit http://jurology.com/.
fast discriminative linear models for scalable video tagging this paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. the features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3d viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. the features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. this paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. the recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. this approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.
antibody response to a sterile filtered ppd tuberculin in m. bovis infected and m. bovis sensitized cattle since 1922 when wu proposed the use of the folin phenol reagent for the measurement of proteins, a number of modified analytical procedures utilizing this reagent have been reported for the determination of proteins in serum, in antigen-antibody precipitates, and in insulin. although the reagent would seem to be recommended by its great sensitivity and the simplicity of procedure possible with its use, it has not found great favor for general biochemical purposes. in the belief that this reagent, nevertheless, has considerable merit for certain application, but that its peculiarities and limitations need to be understood for its fullest exploitation, it has been studied with regard to effects of variations in ph, time of reaction, and concentration of reactants, permissible levels of reagents commonly used in handling proteins, and interfering substances. procedures are described for measuring protein in solution or after precipitation with acids or other agents, and for the determination of as little as 0.2 gamma of protein.
a pilot study of marking accuracy and mental workload as measures of osce examiner performance introduction: graduate-entry medical programmes (gep) have been introduced into many uk universities. their shortened 4-year programme may restrict exposure to the clinical environment. the gep at swansea university has introduced learning opportunities in the clinical setting (locs), a novel approach, allowing students to choose half day sessions from a list which aimed at bringing experiential clinical learning to first and second year students on the course. methods: during the academic years 2007–2008 and 2008–2009, student feedback was collected anonymously online with the options ‘very useful’, ‘useful’ or ‘not useful’ followed by a free text box space to feedback their experience. the text was assessed using qualitative analysis methodology. results: a total of 730 locs feedback comments were analysed, 422 were recorded as ‘very useful’ (58%), 276 were ‘useful’ (38%) and 32 ‘not useful’ (4%). students’ feedback were divided into positive (1330) and negative (152) comments. positive themes were broadly divided into four categories: positive teacher experience, positive clinical experience, relevance to the course and significant personal development. conclusion: the locs system provides an efficient method of providing students with a choice of additional learning opportunities which has proved popular and, in the opinion of students, educationally effective.
beta-amyloid induced changes in a-type k+ current can alter hippocampo-septal network dynamics cortical-projecting thalamic neurons, in guinea pig brain slices, display high-frequency membrane potential oscillations (20-80 hz), when their somata are depolarized beyond -45 mv. these oscillations, preferentially located at dendritic sites, are supported by the activation of p/q type calcium channels, as opposed to the expected persistent sodium conductance responsible for such rhythmic behavior in other central neurons. short hyperpolarizing pulses reset the phase and transiently increase the amplitude of these oscillations. this intrinsic thalamic electroresponsiveness may serve as a cellular-based temporal binding mechanism that sharpens the temporal coincidence of cortical-feedback synaptic inputs, known to distribute at remote dendritic sites on thalamic neurons.
the hessian of a genus one curve 1. introduction. if we wish to write the equations of curves of genus 1 that give elements of the shafarevich-tate group of an elliptic curve over a number field k, a choice of ways is open to us. for example, if the element in question is of order 3 the curve of genus 1 corresponding to it occurs as a smooth plane cubic curve over k. in a recent article [c-m] we raised the question of when one can find the curves of genus 1 corresponding to at least some of the elements of shafarevich-tate groups as curves in abelian surfaces over k. adam logan, using data and programs due to cremona, studied this question numerically for semistable optimal elliptic curves e over q of square-free conductor n less than about 3000, and for the odd part of their shafarevich-tate group. by an " optimal " elliptic curve (or in older terminology, a " strong weil " curve) we mean that there is a modular parametrization φ : j 0 (n) → e where n = the conductor of e, j 0 (n) = the jacobian of the modular curve x 0 (n), and such that the kernel of φ is an abelian variety. any modular elliptic curve is isogeneous, over q, to a (unique) optimal elliptic curve, and any optimal elliptic curve of conductor n is isomorphic, over q, to an elliptic curve in j 0 (n). logan studied the elements of the shafarevich-tate group of such optimal elliptic curves, and sought, in effect, to realize the corresponding curves of genus 1 in question as subcurves defined over q within abelian surfaces contained in the new part of j 0 (n). if e is an optimal elliptic curve for which we can successfully do this for each of the elements of the shafarevich-tate group of e, let us say that we have visualized the shafarevich-tate group of e in abelian surfaces in the new part of the modular jacobian.
a novel detection scheme for space-time block coded systems with imperfect csi and cfo estimation we revisit space-time codes for a mobile communication system that employs multiple antennas at the base station and optional antenna diversity at the mobile station. the realistic case when the channel state is not completely known is considered. it is assumed that the channel estimator extracts the fade coefficients using orthogonal pilot tones. mismatch analysis is then carried out. it is proved that in the absence of ideal channel state information the design criteria for space-time codes developed in tarokh et al. (1997) is still valid for the equal energy constellation case. using our derivation, it is observed that channel estimation techniques commonly used over rapidly fading channels can be used in conjunction with space-time codes provided that the number of transmit antennas is small.
a set of regulatory genes co-expressed in embryonic human brain is implicated in disrupted speech development purpose:the goal of this study was to identify new candidate genes and genomic copy-number variations associated with a rare, severe, and persistent speech disorder termed childhood apraxia of speech. childhood apraxia of speech is the speech disorder segregating with a mutation in foxp2 in a multigenerational london pedigree widely studied for its role in the development of speech–language in humans.methods:a total of 24 participants who were suspected to have childhood apraxia of speech were assessed using a comprehensive protocol that samples speech in challenging contexts. all participants met clinical-research criteria for childhood apraxia of speech. array comparative genomic hybridization analyses were completed using a customized 385k nimblegen array (roche nimblegen, madison, wi) with increased coverage of genes and regions previously associated with childhood apraxia of speech.results:a total of 16 copy-number variations with potential consequences for speech–language development were detected in 12 or half of the 24 participants. the copy-number variations occurred on 10 chromosomes, 3 of which had two to four candidate regions. several participants were identified with copy-number variations in two to three regions. in addition, one participant had a heterozygous foxp2 mutation and a copy-number variation on chromosome 2, and one participant had a 16p11.2 microdeletion and copy-number variations on chromosomes 13 and 14.conclusion:findings support the likelihood of heterogeneous genomic pathways associated with childhood apraxia of speech.genet med 2012:14(11):928–936
a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
cross-lingual sense determination: can it work? the three corpus-based statistical sense resolution methods studied here attempt to infer the correct sense of a polysemous word by using knowledge about patterns of word cooccurrences. the techniques were based on bayesian decision theory, neural, networks, and content vectors as used in information retrieval. to understand these methods better, we posed a very specific problem: given a set of contexts, each containing the noun line in a known sense, construct a classifier that selects the correct sense of line for new contexts. to see how the degree of polysemy affects performance, results from three- and six-sense tasks are compared.the results demonstrate that each of the techniques is able to distinguish six senses of line with an accuracy greater than 70%. furthermore, the response patterns of the classifiers are, for the most part, statistically indistinguishable from one another. comparison of the two tasks suggests that the degree of difficulty involved in resolving individual senses is a greater performance factor than the degree of polysemy.
gender differences in molecular remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy. background we tested the hypothesis that long-term administration of the specific angiotensin ii subtype 1 (at1)-receptor blocker bms-186295 will regress hypertrophy and modify left ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) expression in rats with ascending aortic stenosis.   methods and results six weeks after surgery, rats with ascending aortic stenosis were randomized to receive either the at1-receptor blocker bms-186295 50 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 49), amlodipine 2.5 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 48) as a positive control for systemic vasodilation, or no drug (n = 48) and compared with sham-operated rats (n = 39). drug treatment was continued for 15 weeks. left ventricular ace mrna levels were measured by ribonuclease protection assay. the left ventricular/body weight ratio was increased 43% in hearts from rats with untreated left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) versus control hearts (p < .05). however, there was no difference in either the left ventricular/body weight ratio (2.78 +/- 0.08 versus 2.81 +/- 0.20 mg/g; p = ns) or myocyte cross-sectional area in the at1-blocker-treated versus untreated lvh hearts. amlodipine also showed no effect on regression of hypertrophy. in vivo left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly higher in untreated lvh versus sham-operated rats (193 +/- 8 versus 118 +/- 4 mm hg; p < .05), and there was a similar severe elevation of left ventricular systolic pressure in the at1-blocker- and amlodipine-treated lvh groups (189 +/- 9 and 188 +/- 16 mm hg; p = ns versus untreated lvh). in vivo left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher in the untreated lvh than in the sham-operated rats (14.8 +/- 2.3 versus 7.0 +/- 0.5 mm hg; p < .05). left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was lower in the at1-blocker-treated (11.0 +/- 1.7 mm hg) and amlodipine-treated rats (11.5 +/- 1.8 mm hg) and was similar to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the sham-operated rats (p = ns). left ventricular ace mrna levels were elevated in untreated lvh rats but were normalized in both the at1-blocker-treated rats and amlodipine-treated rats.   conclusions long-term at1-receptor blockade did not regress lvh in rats with persistent systolic pressure overload due to ascending aortic stenosis. however, both at1-receptor blockade and amlodipine improved in vivo left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in association with the normalization of left ventricular ace mrna levels.
the economic cost of physical inactivity in china. increasingly important objectives for developed and especially for developing countries include increasing the numbers of individuals who do not smoke, who eat healthy diets and who are physically active at levels that are health enhancing. in developing countries, deaths from chronic disease are projected to increase from 56% of all deaths in 2005 to 65% by 2030 (driven largely driven by deaths due to cardiovascular and coronary heart disease); in developed countries, however, the increase is only from 87.5 to 88.5%. the data on physical inactivity presented in this review were derived primarily from world health organization (who) publications and data warehouses. the prevalence of physical inactivity at less than the levels recommended for enhancing health is high; from 17 to 91% in developing countries and from 4 to 84% in developed countries. in developed countries, physical inactivity is associated with considerable economic burden, with 1.5–3.0% of total direct healthcare costs being accounted for by physical inactivity. other than on some exciting work in brazil, there is little information on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of physical activity-enhancement strategies in developing countries. the who has signaled a shift from the treatment of illness to promotion of health, with an emphasis on changing modifiable health-risk factors, including smoking, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity: the real question, especially for developing countries, is ‘what is the future healthcare cost of not encouraging healthier lifestyles today?’
prenatal programming of renal function: the estimated glomerular filtration rate is influenced by size at birth in apparently healthy children aim. inulin clearance (cin) is the gold standard for assessing glomerular filtration rate (gfr). other methods are based on the plasma creatinine concentration (pcreat), creatinine clearance (ccreat), the haycock‐schwartz formula and the plasma concentration of cystatin c (pcysc), a 13kda basic protein produced at a constant rate by all nucleated cells. the present prospective study was thus designed to evaluate the reliability of pcysc as a marker of gfr in comparison with that of pcreat, ccreat and the haycock‐schwartz formula, using cin as the gold standard. methods: ninety‐nine children (51 m/48 f), with a median age of 8.3 y (1.0–17.9) were studied. using a cut‐off for cin of 100ml/min per 1.73 m2, 54 children (54.5%) had impaired gfr. those with normal gfr were comparable for age, height, weight and body mass index. results: logistic regression, roc analysis and linear regression all showed that ccreat was the best parameter to discriminate between impaired and normal gfr, followed by the haycock‐schwartz formula, pcysc, and finally pcreat, each one being significantly more predictive than the next.
applicability of a segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis for predicting the whole body skeletal muscle volume. this study aimed to investigate the validity of using segmental bioelectrical impedance (bi) analysis for estimating skeletal muscle volume (mv) in the trunk, defined as the body segment from the acromion process to the greater trochanter. using a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) method, the trunk mv was determined in 28 men (19 approximately 34 yr), divided into validation (n = 20) and cross-validation (n = 8) groups, and used as a reference (mv(mri)). for bi measurements of the trunk, the source electrodes were placed at the dorsal surface of the third metacarpal bone of both hands and the dorsal surface of the third metatarsal bone of both feet, and the detector electrodes were placed at the acromion process of both shoulders and the greater trochanter of both femurs. using this arrangement, the bi values of five parts of the trunk, both sides of the upper region, the middle region, and both sides of the lower region, were obtained and then used to calculate the whole trunk bi value and bi index (bi index(tr)). in the validation group, a simple regression analysis of the relationship between bi index(tr) and mv(mri) showed a significant correlation between the two variables (r = 0.884, p < 0.05) and produced a prediction equation with a se of estimation of 1,020.3 cm3 (8.5%). in the validation and cross-validation groups, there were no significant differences between the measured and estimated mv without systematic errors. these findings indicate that the segmental bi analysis employed in the present study can be used to estimate trunk mv.
a putative alzheimer's disease risk allele in pck1 influences brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis this paper presents a simple, efficient computer-based method for discovering causal relationships from databases that contain observational data. observational data is passively observed, as contrasted with experimental data. most of the databases available for data mining are observational. there is great potential for mining such databases to discover causal relationships. we illustrate how observational data can constrain the causal relationships among measured variables, sometimes to the point that we can conclude that one variable is causing another variable. the presentation here is based on a constraint-based approach to causal discovery. a primary purpose of this paper is to present the constraint-based causal discovery method in the simplest possible fashion in order to (1) readily convey the basic ideas that underlie more complex constraint-based causal discovery techniques, and (2) permit interested readers to rapidly program and apply the method to their own databases, as a start toward using more elaborate causal discovery algorithms.
fa1p is a 171 kda protein essential for axonemal microtubule severing in chlamydomonas. we report here the complete sequence of the gamma dynein heavy chain of the outer arm of the chlamydomonas flagellum, and partial sequences for six other dynein heavy chains. the gamma dynein heavy chain sequence contains four p-loop motifs, one of which is the likely hydrolytic site based on its position relative to a previously mapped epitope. comparison with available cytoplasmic and flagellar dynein heavy chain sequences reveals regions that are highly conserved in all dynein heavy chains sequenced to date, regions that are conserved only among axonemal dynein heavy chains, and regions that are unique to individual dynein heavy chains. the presumed hydrolytic site is absolutely conserved among dyneins, two other p loops are highly conserved among cytoplasmic dynein heavy chains but not in axonemal dynein heavy chains, and the fourth p loop is invariant in axonemal dynein heavy chains but not in cytoplasmic dynein. one region that is very highly conserved in all dynein heavy chains is similar to a portion of the atp-sensitive microtubule-binding domain of kinesin. two other regions present in all dynein heavy chains are predicted to have high alpha-helical content and have a high probability of forming coiled-coil structures. overall, the central one-third of the gamma dynein heavy chain is most conserved whereas the n-terminal one-third is least conserved; the fact that the latter region is divergent between the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain and two different axonemal dynein heavy chains suggests that it is involved in chain-specific functions.
air pollution and the microvasculature: a cross-sectional assessment of in vivo retinal images in the population-based multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (mesa) we describe a methodology for assigning individual estimates of long-term average air pollution concentrations that accounts for a complex spatio-temporal correlation structure and can accommodate spatio-temporally misaligned observations. this methodology has been developed as part of the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis and air pollution (mesa air), a prospective cohort study funded by the u.s. epa to investigate the relationship between chronic exposure to air pollution and cardiovascular disease. our hierarchical model decomposes the space-time field into a "mean" that includes dependence on covariates and spatially varying seasonal and long-term trends and a "residual" that accounts for spatially correlated deviations from the mean model. the model accommodates complex spatio-temporal patterns by characterizing the temporal trend at each location as a linear combination of empirically derived temporal basis functions, and embedding the spatial fields of coefficients for the basis functions in separate linear regression models with spatially correlated residuals (universal kriging). this approach allows us to implement a scalable single-stage estimation procedure that easily accommodates a significant number of missing observations at some monitoring locations. we apply the model to predict long-term average concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (nox) from 2005-2007 in the los angeles area, based on data from 18 epa air quality system regulatory monitors. the cross-validated r2 is 0.67. the mesa air study is also collecting additional concentration data as part of a supplementary monitoring campaign. we describe the sampling plan and demonstrate in a simulation study that the additional data will contribute to improved predictions of long-term average concentrations.
consumption of added sugars from liquid but not solid sources predicts impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance among youth at risk of obesity. mixed longitudinal data on the physical changes at puberty in 228 normal boys are presented together with normal standards for stages of genital and pubic hair development. the genitalia began to develop between the ages 9½ years and 13½ years in 95% of boys (mean = 11.6 ± 0.09) and reached maturity at ages varying between 13 and 17 (mean = 14.9 ± 1.10). the age at which pubic hair first appeared was not accurately determined, but its development through the later stages was studied. it reached the equivalent of an adult female distribution at a mean age of 15.2 ± 0.01 years. on average the genitalia reached the adult stage 3.0 years after they first began to develop; but some boys completed this development in as little as 1.8 years while others took as much as 4.7 years. some boys complete the whole process in less time than others take to go from stage g2 to stage g3. the genitalia begin to develop before pubic hair is visible in photographs in practically all boys. the 41 boys in whom it could be studied reached their maximum rate of growth (peak height velocity) at a mean age of 14.1 ± 0.14 years. very few boys (about 5%) reached peak height velocity before their genitalia were in stage 4 and over 20% did not do so until their genitalia were adult. peak height velocity is reached, on the average, nearly 2 years later in boys than in girls, but the boys' genitalia begin to develop only about 6 months later than the girls' breasts. pubic hair appears about 1½ years later in boys than in girls.
a comparison of methods for differential expression analysis of rna-seq data we discuss the identification of features that are associated with an outcome in rna-sequencing (rna-seq) and other sequencing-based comparative genomic experiments. rna-seq data takes the form of counts, so models based on the normal distribution are generally unsuitable. the problem is especially challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads, or ‘sequencing depths’. existing methods for this problem are based on poisson or negative binomial models: they are useful but can be heavily influenced by ‘outliers’ in the data. we introduce a simple, non-parametric method with resampling to account for the different sequencing depths. the new method is more robust than parametric methods. it can be applied to data with quantitative, survival, two-class or multiple-class outcomes. we compare our proposed method to poisson and negative binomial-based methods in simulated and real data sets, and find that our method discovers more consistent patterns than competing methods.
heart rate topic models we propose a generative model for text and other collections of discrete data that generalizes or improves on several previous models including naive bayes/unigram, mixture of unigrams [6], and hofmann's aspect model , also known as probabilistic latent semantic indexing (plsi) [3]. in the context of text modeling, our model posits that each document is generated as a mixture of topics, where the continuous-valued mixture proportions are distributed as a latent dirichlet random variable. inference and learning are carried out efficiently via variational algorithms. we present empirical results on applications of this model to problems in text modeling, collaborative filtering, and text classification.
the antibody response of pregnant cameroonian women to var2csa id1-id2a, a small recombinant protein containing the csa-binding site var2csa mediates sequestration of plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placenta, increasing the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. naturally acquired antibodies (ab) to placental parasites at delivery have been associated with improved pregnancy outcomes, but ab levels and how early in pregnancy ab must be present in order to eliminate placental parasites before delivery remains unknown. antibodies to individual duffy-binding like domains of var2csa have been studied, but the domains lack many of the conformational epitopes present in full-length var2csa (fv2). thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the acquisition of ab to fv2 in women residing in high and low transmission areas and determine how ab levels during pregnancy correlate with clearance of placental parasites. plasma samples collected monthly throughout pregnancy from pregnant women living in high and low transmission areas in cameroon were evaluated for ab to fv2 and the proportion of high avidity ab (i.e., ab that remain bound in the presence of 3m nh4scn) was assessed. ab levels and proportion of high avidity ab were compared between women with placental malaria (pm+) and those without (pm−) at delivery. results showed that pm− women had significantly higher ab levels (p = 0.0047) and proportion of high avidity ab (p = 0.0009) than pm+ women throughout pregnancy. specifically, women with moderate to high ab levels (>5,000 mfi) and those with ≥35% high avidity ab at 5–6 months were found to have 2.3 (95% ci, 1.0–4.9) and 7.6-fold (p = 0.0013, 95% ci: 1.2–50.0) reduced risk of placental malaria, respectively. these data show that high levels of ab to fv2, particularly those with high avidity for fv2, produced by mid-pregnancy are important in clearing parasites from the placenta. both high ab levels and proportion of high avidity ab to fv2 may serve as correlates of protection for assessing immunity against placental malaria.
subcutaneous dissociative conscious sedation (sdcs) an alternative method for airway regional blocks: a new approach laparoscopy is an effective method of implantation for peritoneal dialysis (pd) catheters. use of the laparoscopic technique is increasing because of its potential advantages over other techniques. in most patients, selection for pd is based on negative criteria, and because of the need for general anesthesia, the laparoscopic technique can be life-threatening in these patients. on the other hand, local anesthesia is insufficient for laparoscopic catheter implantation. to avoid the need for general anesthesia and to achieve patient safety and satisfaction, we designed a type of conscious sedation (dissociative conscious sedation) and compared the efficacy of subcutaneous (sc) and intravenous (iv) ketamine added to narcotics in patients scheduled for laparoscopic implantation of a pd catheter. ♦ methods: our prospective randomized double-blind study enrolled 60 adult patients with chronic renal failure who were scheduled for laparoscopic implantation of a pd catheter. patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one receiving iv ketamine, and the other receiving sc ketamine. in both groups, patients were premedicated with iv midazolam 0.015 mg/kg, fentanyl 1–2 μg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. patients then received 0.6 mg/kg ketamine either intravenously (iv group) or by subcutaneous injection at the anterior aspect of the forearm (sc group). if systolic blood pressure (bp) increased more than 20% from baseline or exceeded 170 mmhg, iv nitroglycerine (tng) 50 μg was administered incrementally (repeated 50-μg doses). after a desirable level of conscious sedation was achieved, local anesthesia and nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum were applied, and the pd catheter was implanted under laparoscopic guidance. heart rate and bp were measured throughout the procedure. adverse effects and recovery events were recorded. ♦ results: all patients tolerated the procedure well. administration of tng was significantly more frequent in the iv ketamine group. pain intensity during the surgery was similar in both groups. both groups were comparable with regard to heart rate, but patients in the sc ketamine group had a significantly lower systolic bp at the 2nd measurement and a lower rate–pressure product at the 2nd, 4th, and 5th measurements. all patients in the sc ketamine group were cooperative during surgery and experienced uneventful recoveries; mild hallucinations were observed in 5 patients in the iv ketamine group. in the iv ketamine group, 3 patients lost the ability to cooperate during surgery. all catheters were successfully placed. ♦ conclusions: dissociative conscious sedation is an acceptable alternative to general anesthesia in laparoscopic implantation of the pd catheter. ketamine by the sc route is as effective as, but safer than, iv ketamine.
the relationship between sustained attention, attentional selectivity, and capacity insufficient attention to tasks can result in slips of action as automatic, unintended action sequences are triggered inappropriately. such slips arise in part from deficits in sustained attention, which are particularly likely to happen following frontal lobe and white matter damage in traumatic brain injury (tbi). we present a reliable laboratory paradigm that elicits such slips of action and demonstrates high correlations between the severity of brain damage and relative-reported everyday attention failures in a group of 34 tbi patients. we also demonstrate significant correlations between self- and informant-reported everyday attentional failures and performance on this paradigm in a group of 75 normal controls. the paradigm (the sustained attention to response task-sart) involves the withholding of key presses to rare (one in nine) targets. performance on the sart correlates significantly with performance on tests of sustained attention, but not other types of attention, supporting the view that this is indeed a measure of sustained attention. we also show that errors (false presses) on the sart can be predicted by a significant shortening of reaction times in the immediately preceding responses, supporting the view that these errors are a result of 'drift' of controlled processing into automatic responding consequent on impaired sustained attention to task. we also report a highly significant correlation of -0.58 between sart performance and glasgow coma scale scores in the tbi group.
on the phylogenetics and population differentiation of the great tit and blue tit in jordan the colonization history and present-day population structure of the european subspecies of the great tit parus major major were studied using mitochondrial control region sequences. one major haplotype was found in all but one of the eight sampled populations from spain to northern finland. the other haplotypes differed from the common one by just a few substitutions; the overall nucleotide diversity was 0.00187 and haplotype diversity 0.8633. no population structuring was detected. the mismatch distribution followed the expected distribution of an expanding population. the estimated time to the most recent common ancestor coincides with the last glacial period. the results suggest that p. m. major survived the last glacial period in a single isolated refuge probably by the mediterranean sea. this was followed by rapid colonization of the european continent and population growth. the most recent range expansion northwards is still occurring. gene flow between the sampled populations is extensive. it is aided by juvenile dispersal, long-distance movements of juvenile flocks and partial migration in the northern parts of the great tit’s range.
excitotoxic activation of the nmda receptor results in inhibition of calcium/calmodulin kinase ii activity in cultured hippocampal neurons acute forebrain ischemia in the gerbil produced a significant decrease in endogenous ca2+-dependent hippocampal protein phosphorylation in comparison to sham and naive control animals. inhibition of ca2+-dependent phosphorylation was demonstrated as early as 2 h post-ischemia and shown to persist up to 7 days following the ischemic insult. the ischemia-induced loss of ca2+-dependent phosphorylation was only seen in brain regions affected by the localized ischemia and not in non-ischemic brain regions from the same animal. these results suggest that an early event in the development of ischemia-induced neuronal death is a decrease in ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation.
efficient generation of schwann cells from human embryonic stem cell-derived neurospheres human embryonic stem cells (hesc) have been directed to differentiate into cns cells with clinical importance. however, for study of development and regeneration of the human pns, and peripheral neuropathies, it would be useful to have a source of human pns derivatives. we have demonstrated that peripheral sensory neuron-like cells (psn) can also be derived from hesc via neural crest-like (nc) intermediates, and from neural progenitors induced from hesc using noggin. here we report the generation of higher purity psn from passagable neurospheres (nsp) induced by murine pa6 stromal cells. hesc were cultured with pa6, and colonies that developed a specific morphology were cut from the plates. culture of these colonies under non-adhesive conditions yielded nsps. several nc marker genes were expressed in the nsp, and these were also detected in 3-5week gestation human embryos containing migrating nc. these nsps passaged for 2-8weeks and re-plated on pa6 gave rise to many brn3a+/peripherin+ cells, characteristic of early sensory-like neurons. re-culturing pa6-induced nsp cells with pa6 resulted in about 25% of the human cells in the co-cultures differentiating to psn after 1week, compared to only about 10% psn obtained after 3 weeks when noggin-induced nsp were used. two month adherent cultures of pa6-induced nsp cells contained neurons expressing several psn neuropeptides, and voltage-dependent currents and action potentials were obtained from a molecularly identified psn. hesc-derived pa6-induced nsp cells are therefore an excellent potential source of human psn for study of differentiation and modeling of pns disease.
kernel coupled distance metric learning for gait recognition and face recognition a biometrics technique based on metric learning approach is proposed in this paper to achieve higher correct classification rates under the condition that the feature of the query is very different from that of the register for a given individual. inspired by the definition of generalized distance, the criterion of this new metric learning is defined by finding an embedding that preserves local information and obtaining a subspace that best detects the essential manifold structure. furthermore, the two transformation matrices for the query and the register are obtained by a generalized eigen-decomposition. experiments tested on biometric applications of casia(b) gait database and the umist face database, demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than classical metric learning methods and the current radial basis function (rbf) algorithms.
improved insulin-sensitivity in mice heterozygous for ppar-γ deficiency whether insulin acts immediately on the liver to reduce its rate of glucose output is a matter of great current interest. from the theoretical aspect, the answer given to this question has serious implications with respect to hypotheses concerning the mechanism of insulin action. in particular, an increase in permeability to glucose of the hepatic cell membrane should increase rather than decrease its rate of glucose output. in the hepatic cell, in contrast to the muscle cell, the net flow of glucose is from inside to outside the cell, and an increased facility for glucose transport across the cell membrane of the kind postulated for insulin action on the muscle cell could serve only to increase this flow and not to decrease it. several investigative groups have used c14 glucose in attempts to supply the answer to this question, and the divergent findings that have resulted have been summarized and evaluated in a recent article.' in the present communication special consideration is given to the extent to which these divergencies are due, on the one hand, to diflerences in experimental findings brought about by dserences in experimental conditions and procedures, and are due, on the other hand, to differences in interpretation and calculation.
catheter related bloodstream infection (cr-bsi) in icu patients: making the decision to remove or not to remove the central venous catheter study objective to evaluate the relationship between the adequacy of antimicrobial treatment for bloodstream infections and clinical outcomes among patients requiring icu admission.   design prospective cohort study.   setting a medical icu (19 beds) and a surgical icu (18 beds) from a university-affiliated urban teaching hospital.   patients between july 1997 and july 1999, 492 patients were prospectively evaluated.   intervention prospective patient surveillance and data collection.   results one hundred forty-seven patients (29.9%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment for their bloodstream infections. the hospital mortality rate of patients with a bloodstream infection receiving inadequate antimicrobial treatment (61.9%) was statistically greater than the hospital mortality rate of patients with a bloodstream infection who received adequate antimicrobial treatment (28.4%; relative risk, 2. 18; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.77 to 2.69; p < 0.001). multiple logistic regression analysis identified the administration of inadequate antimicrobial treatment as an independent determinant of hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 6.86; 95% ci, 5.09 to 9.24; p < 0.001). the most commonly identified bloodstream pathogens and their associated rates of inadequate antimicrobial treatment included vancomycin-resistant enterococci (n = 17; 100%), candida species (n = 41; 95.1%), oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 46; 32.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 96; 21.9%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 22; 10.0%). a statistically significant relationship was found between the rates of inadequate antimicrobial treatment for individual microorganisms and their associated rates of hospital mortality (spearman correlation coefficient = 0.8287; p = 0.006). multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated that a bloodstream infection attributed to candida species (aor, 51.86; 95% ci, 24.57 to 109.49; p < 0.001), prior administration of antibiotics during the same hospitalization (aor, 2.08; 95% ci, 1.58 to 2.74; p = 0.008), decreasing serum albumin concentrations (1-g/dl decrements) (aor, 1.37; 95% ci, 1.21 to 1.56; p = 0.014), and increasing central catheter duration (1-day increments) (aor, 1.03; 95% ci, 1.02 to 1.04; p = 0.008) were independently associated with the administration of inadequate antimicrobial treatment.   conclusions the administration of inadequate antimicrobial treatment to critically ill patients with bloodstream infections is associated with a greater hospital mortality compared with adequate antimicrobial treatment of bloodstream infections. these data suggest that clinical efforts should be aimed at reducing the administration of inadequate antimicrobial treatment to hospitalized patients with bloodstream infections, especially individuals infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and candida species.
an open source workbench for prototyping multimodal interactions based on off-the-shelf heterogeneous components this paper reports on an optimum dynamic progxamming (dp) based time-normalization algorithm for spoken word recognition. first, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. these two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. the symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. a new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. the effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. the optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various dp-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. the experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm.
strigolactone biosynthesis in medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic gras-type transcription factors nsp1 and nsp2[w][oa] the strigolactones are internal and rhizosphere signalling molecules in plants that are biosynthesised through carotenoid cleavage. they are secreted by host roots into the rhizosphere where they signal host-presence to the symbiotic arbuscular mycrorrhizal (am) fungi and the parasitic plants of the orobanche, phelipanche and striga genera. the seeds of these parasitic plants germinate after perceiving these signalling molecules. after attachment to the host root, the parasite negatively affects the host plant by withdrawing water, nutrients and assimilates through a direct connection with the host xylem. in many areas of the world these parasites are a threat to agriculture but so far very limited success has been achieved to minimize losses due to these parasitic weeds. considering the carotenoid origin of the strigolactones, in the present study we investigated the possibilities to reduce strigolactone production in the roots of plants by blocking carotenoid biosynthesis using carotenoid inhibitors. hereto the carotenoid inhibitors fluridone, norflurazon, clomazone and amitrole were applied to rice either through irrigation or through foliar spray. irrigation application of all carotenoid inhibitors and spray application of amitrole significantly decreased strigolactone production, striga hermonthica germination and striga infection, also in concentrations too low to affect growth and development of the host plant. hence, we demonstrate that the application of carotenoid inhibitors to plants can affect s. hermonthica germination and attachment indirectly by reducing the strigolactone concentration in the rhizosphere. this finding is useful for further studies on the relevance of the strigolactones in rhizosphere signalling. since these inhibitors are available and accessible, they may represent an efficient technology for farmers, including poor subsistence farmers in the african continent, to control these harmful parasitic weeds.
scale-recurrent network for deep image deblurring the goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. in this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. by extending the fully connected lstm (fc-lstm) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional lstm (convlstm) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. experiments show that our convlstm network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms fc-lstm and the state-of-the-art operational rover algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.

smoking cessation increases short-term risk of type 2 diabetes irrespective of weight gain: the japan public health center-based prospective study : to examine the association between alcohol consumption and mortality in japan, where mortality and lifestyle differ substantially from western countries, a population-based prospective study was conducted in four public health center areas as part of the japan public health center-based prospective study on cancer and cardiovascular disease (jphc). after excluding subjects with self-reported serious diseases at baseline, 19,231 men aged 40-59 years who reported their alcohol intake were followed from 1990 through 1996, and 548 deaths were documented. the association between all-cause mortality and alcohol consumption was j-shaped. the lowest risk was observed for men who consumed 1-149 g/week (relative risk (rr) = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.46, 0.88), while the highest risk was seen for men who consumed > or =450 g/week (rr = 1.32, 95% ci 1.00, 1.74), after adjustment for possible confounders. the association did not change after excluding deaths that occurred in the first 2 years of follow-up. however, the association was modified by smoking, and beneficial effects of moderate drinking were largely limited to nonsmokers. the risk of cancer death showed a similar trend, but increased more in heavy drinkers. the background characteristics of moderate drinkers were healthier than either nondrinkers or heavy drinkers. the authors conclude that moderate alcohol consumption was associated with the lowest risks of all-cause and cancer mortality, especially among nonsmokers.
association of interleukin-18 gene promoter −607 c>a and −137g>c polymorphisms with cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 26 studies abstract objective: funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. we examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. design: medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the cochrane database of systematic reviews. main outcome measure: degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. results: in the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. in all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. in 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. conclusions: a simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. key messages systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials funnel plots, plots of the trials' effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of reviews from the cochrane database of systematic reviews critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure
risk factors and mitigation strategies for pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy: analysis of 2026 resections from the international, multi-institutional distal pancreatectomy study group background postoperative complications are key outcomes of surgical procedures, but currently there is no uniform quantitative measure of complication severity. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and establish feasibility of quantitative morbidity scores for several common abdominal surgical procedures.   study design using american college of surgeons' national surgical quality improvement program data, complications were identified in 5 common abdominal procedures for one institution in 2005-2008, including inguinal hernia, appendectomy, laparoscopic colectomy, hepatectomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. complications were graded by the 6-level "expanded" accordion severity grading system. quantification was performed using severity scores described previously.   results six hundred and seventy-six procedures were identified, including 88 patients (13.84%) who had complications and 5 patients (0.79%) who died. after severity weighting, the postoperative morbidity index (pmi) for each procedure was derived. an index of 0 would indicate no complication in any patient and an index of 1.000 would indicate that all operated patients died. pmis were hernia repair 0.005; appendectomy 0.031; laparoscopic colectomy 0.082; hepatectomy 0.145; and pancreaticoduodenectomy 0.150. pmi of hepatectomy was greatly affected by the presence of a second procedure, ie, 0.070 without a second procedure and 0.427 with a second procedure. weighted severity spectragrams were developed, portraying the impact of each grade of complication on overall morbidity.   conclusions quantification of severity of postoperative complications is possible using american college of surgeons' national surgical quality improvement program methods and the accordion severity grading system. procedural pmi can be useful in assessing surgical outcomes. certain limitations, particularly the need for risk adjustment, still need to be addressed.
phylogenetic analysis of vp1 gene sequences of waterfowl parvoviruses from the mainland of china revealed genetic diversity and recombination. bocavirus include bovine parvovirus, minute virus of canine, porcine bocavirus, gorilla bocavirus, and human bocaviruses 1-4 (hbovs). although recent reports showed that recombination happened in bocavirus, no systematical study investigated the recombination of bocavirus. the present study performed the phylogenetic and recombination analysis of bocavirus over the complete genomes available in genbank. results confirmed that recombination existed among bocavirus, including the likely inter-genotype recombination between hbov1 and hbov4, and intra-genotype recombination among hbov2 variants. moreover, it is the first report revealing the recombination that occurred between minute viruses of canine.
an approximate dynamic programming framework for modeling global climate policy under decision-dependent uncertainty abstract environmental problems, such as climate change, have great uncertainties. current expectations are that uncertainties about climate change will be resolved quickly. we examine this hypothesis theoretically and computationally. we consider bayesian learning about the relationship between greenhouse gas levels and global mean temperature changes, a key uncertainty. learning is non-trivial because of a stochastic shock to the realized temperature. we find theoretically the expected learning time, which is related to the variance of the shock and the emissions policy, implying a tradeoff between the benefits of controlling emissions and information. we imbed the learning model into an optimal growth model with a climate sector and solve the resulting dynamic program. we find computationally that learning takes on average over 90 yr, far longer than currently believed.
new approach for a reliable in vitro sun protection factor method part i: principle and mathematical aspects in thein vitro evaluation of sun protection factor (spf), the photostability of the ultraviolet (uv) filters can have a major impact, especially for high‐spf formulations, but is generally not taken into consideration. in this study, we present a uv transmission spectrum measurement system utilizing a high‐sensitivity uv photomultiplier tube with concomitant evaluation of photostability. we have developed an algorithm to estimate spf in vitro by converting the amount of uv light transmission through the sunscreen layer into cumulative relative erythema effectiveness to obtain one minimal erythema dose. thus, the algorithm uses the same endpoint as in vivo spf methods, but with a photomultiplier tube as the detector instead of skin. the values obtained showed an excellent correlation with in vivo spf values, even for high‐spf sunscreens exceeding spf 50. this method should be suitable as an in vitro spf testing method for regulatory purposes.
characterization of hymenobacter isolates from victoria upper glacier, antarctica reveals five new species and substantial non-vertical evolution within this genus despite recent advances achieved by application of high-performance computing methods and novel algorithmic techniques to maximum likelihood (ml)-based inference programs, the major computational bottleneck still consists in the computation of bootstrap support values. conducting a probably insufficient number of 100 bootstrap (bs) analyses with current ml programs on large datasets-either with respect to the number of taxa or base pairs-can easily require a month of run time. therefore, we have developed, implemented, and thoroughly tested rapid bootstrap heuristics in raxml (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood) that are more than an order of magnitude faster than current algorithms. these new heuristics can contribute to resolving the computational bottleneck and improve current methodology in phylogenetic analyses. computational experiments to assess the performance and relative accuracy of these heuristics were conducted on 22 diverse dna and aa (amino acid), single gene as well as multigene, real-world alignments containing 125 up to 7764 sequences. the standard bs (sbs) and rapid bs (rbs) values drawn on the best-scoring ml tree are highly correlated and show almost identical average support values. the weighted rf (robinson-foulds) distance between sbs- and rbs-based consensus trees was smaller than 6% in all cases (average 4%). more importantly, rbs inferences are between 8 and 20 times faster (average 14.73) than sbs analyses with raxml and between 18 and 495 times faster than bs analyses with competing programs, such as phyml or garli. moreover, this performance improvement increases with alignment size. finally, we have set up two freely accessible web servers for this significantly improved version of raxml that provide access to the 200-cpu cluster of the vital-it unit at the swiss institute of bioinformatics and the 128-cpu cluster of the cipres project at the san diego supercomputer center. these web servers offer the possibility to conduct large-scale phylogenetic inferences to a large part of the community that does not have access to, or the expertise to use, high-performance computing resources.

traffic modelling and performance evaluation for a broadband satellite network with on-board processor we present a methodology to model traffic for analysis and simulation of a high capacity multi-beam satellite network with on-board cross-connectivity. we discuss different types of traffic including voice and data and model them by using several parameters such as up and down peak and average data rates, session duration, and session frequency. the methodology we use generalizes techniques, for generating a community of interest, that were previously used for telephony networks to multimedia networks in general and satellite networks in particular. we report in this paper on simulation and analysis results for the methodology. the traffic modelling approach and technique presented in this paper enables a satellite system planner to thoroughly evaluate and analyze the impact of a variety of traffic scenarios on the satellite network. based on the detailed analysis, design tradeoffs can be made with a high degree of confidence.
treatment-induced changes in plasma adiponectin do not reduce urinary albumin excretion in the diabetes prevention program cohort background adiponectin is an adipose-derived hormone that plays a role in regulating metabolic processes such as fat partitioning and lipid and glucose metabolism. quantification of adiponectin is useful for obtaining information on metabolic syndrome, but there is no rapid method to measure adiponectin for clinical use.   methods we developed a rapid and sensitive latex particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (ltia) using a latex bead-immobilized anti-adiponectin polyclonal antibody. the assay was performed on a hitachi h7170 analyzer and evaluated for validity as a method to quantitate adiponectin, in parallel with the elisa.   results dilution tests using ltia showed linearity from 0.25 to 30 microg/ml. within-run cv and total cv were obtained in the range of 0.8-1.9% and 1.1-2.0%, respectively. no interference was observed in the testing of specimens containing potentially interfering substances such as bilirubin, ditaurobilirubin, hemoglobin triglyceride, rheumatoid factor, type iv collagen, fibronectin, and complement factor (c1q). a strong correlation between ltia and elisa was confirmed (n=30, r=0.990, y=0.95x+0.39).   conclusion the ltia assay is applicable to quantitating the serum concentration of adiponectin. this assay is more convenient and faster than elisa and suitable for clinical routine analysis.
towards a human-friendly melody characterization by automatically induced rules random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. the generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. the generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to adaboost (y. freund & r. schapire, machine learning: proceedings of the thirteenth international conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. these ideas are also applicable to regression.
an imperceptible and robust audio watermarking algorithm this paper presents a secure, robust, and blind adaptive audio watermarking algorithm based on singular value decomposition (svd) in the discrete wavelet transform domain using synchronization code. in our algorithm, a watermark is embedded by applying a quantization-index-modulation process on the singular values in the svd of the wavelet domain blocks. the watermarked signal is perceptually similar to the original audio signal and gives high quality output. experimental results show that the hidden watermark data is robust to additive noise, resampling, low-pass filtering, requantization, mp3 compression, cropping, echo addition, and denoising. performance analysis of the proposed scheme shows low error probability rates. the data embedding rate of the proposed scheme is 45.9 bps. the proposed scheme has high payload and superior performance against mp3 compression compared to the earlier audio watermarking schemes.
fetal echocardiographic measurements and the need for neonatal surgical intervention in tetralogy of fallot objective: to document the echocardiographic features of tetralogy of fallot during fetal and postnatal life. correlation of echocardiographic findings with the requirement for early intervention prior to definitive repair. design: retrospective observational study. setting: a tertiary fetal cardiology unit. patients: fetuses with a diagnosis of tetralogy of fallot identified from a prospective database between 1 january 1999 and 31 october 2002. main measures of outcome: growth of aorta and pulmonary trunk during fetal and postnatal life. doppler assessment of the great arteries both prenatally and postnatally. clinical outcome to definitive repair. results: we identified 25 fetuses with tetralogy of fallot, 23 having a pulmonary valvar diameter below the normal range at some point during gestation. the ratio of the diameter of the aortic to the pulmonary valve was abnormal in all cases. the pulmonary arterial doppler velocity was within the normal range in six fetuses at presentation, and elevated in the remainder. in two fetuses, the right ventricular outflow tract was patent during fetal life, but had become atretic at birth. both of these fetuses had reversal of flow in the arterial duct at presentation during fetal life. in 2 fetuses in whom we showed poor growth of the pulmonary trunk in late gestation, it was necessary to intervene early. the doppler velocity across the pulmonary valve during fetal life did not differentiate between babies who required early intervention and those who were repaired electively. there was a marked increase in pulmonary arterial doppler velocity following birth, which became more elevated with age. of 18 liveborn infants, 17 have survived, with 2 having balloon dilation of the right ventricular outflow tract, and 3 insertion of a blalock-taussig shunt prior to definitive repair. conclusions: in tetralogy of fallot, features of pulmonary valvar hypoplasia and obstruction are evident during fetal life. progression of obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract was observed during fetal life as well as postnatally. reversal of flow in the arterial duct, and failure of growth of the pulmonary trunk, predicted the need for early surgery to maintain pulmonary blood flow. parents should be counselled about the possibility of emergency intervention being required after birth. affected fetuses should be delivered at units with experience of managing the cyanosed newborn.
application of genetic algorithm in computing the tradeoffs between power consumption versus delay in digital integrated circuit design the gate sizing problem is the problem of finding load drive capabilities for all gates in a given boolean network such, that a given delay limit is kept, and the necessary cost in terms of active area usage and/or power consumption is minimal. this paper describes a way to obtain the entire cost versus delay trade-off curve of a combinational logic circuit in an efficient way. every point on the resulting curve is the global optimum of the corresponding gate sizing problem. the problem is solved by mapping it onto piecewise linear models in such a way, that a piecewise linear (circuit) simulator can do the job. it is shown that this setup is very efficient, and can produce trade-off curves for large circuits (thousands of gates) in a few minutes. benchmark results for the entire set of mcnc '91 two-level examples are given.
comparative study and meta-analysis of meta-analysis studies for the correlation of genomic markers with early cancer detection an essential prerequisite for any systems-level understanding of cellular functions is to correctly uncover and annotate all functional interactions among proteins in the cell. toward this goal, remarkable progress has been made in recent years, both in terms of experimental measurements and computational prediction techniques. however, public efforts to collect and present protein interaction information have struggled to keep up with the pace of interaction discovery, partly because protein–protein interaction information can be error-prone and require considerable effort to annotate. here, we present an update on the online database resource search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes (string); it provides uniquely comprehensive coverage and ease of access to both experimental as well as predicted interaction information. interactions in string are provided with a confidence score, and accessory information such as protein domains and 3d structures is made available, all within a stable and consistent identifier space. new features in string include an interactive network viewer that can cluster networks on demand, updated on-screen previews of structural information including homology models, extensive data updates and strongly improved connectivity and integration with third-party resources. version 9.0 of string covers more than 1100 completely sequenced organisms; the resource can be reached at http://string-db.org.
semantic object parsing with graph lstm in this work, the human parsing task, namely decomposing a human image into semantic fashion/body regions, is formulated as an active template regression (atr) problem, where the normalized mask of each fashion/body item is expressed as the linear combination of the learned mask templates, and then morphed to a more precise mask with the active shape parameters, including position, scale and visibility of each semantic region. the mask template coefficients and the active shape parameters together can generate the human parsing results, and are thus called the structure outputs for human parsing. the deep convolutional neural network (cnn) is utilized to build the end-to-end relation between the input human image and the structure outputs for human parsing. more specifically, the structure outputs are predicted by two separate networks. the first cnn network is with max-pooling, and designed to predict the template coefficients for each label mask, while the second cnn network is without max-pooling to preserve sensitivity to label mask position and accurately predict the active shape parameters. for a new image, the structure outputs of the two networks are fused to generate the probability of each label for each pixel, and super-pixel smoothing is finally used to refine the human parsing result. comprehensive evaluations on a large dataset well demonstrate the significant superiority of the atr framework over other state-of-the-arts for human parsing. in particular, the f1-score reaches 64.38 percent by our atr framework, significantly higher than 44.76 percent based on the state-of-the-art algorithm [28].

the genetic integrity of the ex situ population of the european wildcat (felis silvestris silvestris) is seriously threatened by introgression from domestic cats (felis silvestris catus) i propose a new estimator for jointly estimating two-gene and four-gene coefficients of relatedness between individuals from an outbreeding population with data on codominant genetic markers and compare it, by monte carlo simulations, to previous ones in precision and accuracy for different distributions of population allele frequencies, numbers of alleles per locus, actual relationships, sample sizes, and proportions of relatives included in samples. in contrast to several previous estimators, the new estimator is well behaved and applies to any number of alleles per locus and any allele frequency distribution. the estimates for two- and four-gene coefficients of relatedness from the new estimator are unbiased irrespective of the sample size and have sampling variances decreasing consistently with an increasing number of alleles per locus to the minimum asymptotic values determined by the variation in identity-by-descent among loci per se, regardless of the actual relationship. the new estimator is also robust for small sample sizes and for unknown relatives being included in samples for estimating allele frequencies. compared to previous estimators, the new one is generally advantageous, especially for highly polymorphic loci and/or small sample sizes.
analysis of similarity based representations on heterogeneous data previous research has resulted in a number of different algorithms for rule discovery. two approaches discussed here, the ‘all-rules’ algorithm and multi-objective metaheuristics, both result in the production of a large number of partial classification rules, or ‘nuggets’, for describing different subsets of the records in the class of interest. this paper describes the application of a number of different clustering algorithms to these rules, in order to identify similar rules and to better understand the data.
dynamic antagonism between phytochromes and pif family basic helix-loop-helix factors induces selective reciprocal responses to light and shade in a rapidly responsive transcriptional network in arabidopsis[c][w] phytochrome-interacting factor5 (pif5), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, interacts specifically with the photoactivated form of phytochrome b (phyb). here, we report that dark-grown arabidopsis thaliana seedlings overexpressing pif5 (pif5-ox) exhibit exaggerated apical hooks and short hypocotyls, reminiscent of the triple response induced by elevated ethylene levels, whereas pif5 mutants fail to maintain tight hooks like those of wild-type seedlings. silver ions, an ethylene receptor blocker, rescued the triple-response phenotype, and we show that pif5-ox seedlings express enhanced levels of key ethylene biosynthesis enzymes and produce elevated ethylene levels. exposure of pif5-ox seedlings to prolonged continuous red light (rc) promotes hypocotyl elongation relative to dark controls, the reciprocal of the rc-imposed hypocotyl inhibition displayed by wild-type seedlings. in contrast with this pif5-ox hyposensitivity to rc, pif5 mutant seedlings are hypersensitive relative to wild-type seedlings. we show that this contrast is due to reciprocal changes in phyb protein levels in prolonged rc. compared with wild-type seedlings, pif5-ox seedlings have reduced, whereas pif5 mutants have increased, phyb (and phyc) levels in rc. the phyb degradation in the overexpressors depends on a functional phyb binding motif in pif5 and involves the 26s proteasome pathway. our data thus indicate that overexpressed pif5 causes altered ethylene levels, which promote the triple response in darkness, whereas in the light, the interaction of photoactivated phyb with pif5 causes degradation of the photoreceptor protein. the evidence suggests that endogenous pif5 negatively regulates phyb-imposed hypocotyl inhibition in prolonged rc by reducing photoreceptor abundance, and thereby photosensory capacity, rather than functioning as a signaling intermediate.
temporal dynamics of late-night photic stimulation of the human circadian timing system. 1. light‐induced phase shifts of the circadian rhythm of wheel‐running activity were used to measure the photic sensitivity of a circadian pacemaker and the visual pathway that conveys light information to it in the golden hamster (mesocricetus auratus). the sensitivity to stimulus irradiance and duration was assessed by measuring the magnitude of phase‐shift responses to photic stimuli of different irradiance and duration. the visual sensitivity was also measured at three different phases of the circadian rhythm. 2. the stimulus‐response curves measured at different circadian phases suggest that the maximum phase‐shift is the only aspect of visual responsivity to change as a function of the circadian day. the half‐saturation constants (sigma) for the stimulus‐response curves are not significantly different over the three circadian phases tested. the photic sensitivity to irradiance (1/sigma) appears to remain constant over the circadian day. 3. the hamster circadian pacemaker and the photoreceptive system that subserves it are more sensitive to the irradiance of longer‐duration stimuli than to irradiance of briefer stimuli. the system is maximally sensitive to the irradiance of stimuli of 300 s and longer in duration. a quantitative model is presented to explain the changes that occur in the stimulus‐response curves as a function of photic stimulus duration. 4. the threshold for photic stimulation of the hamster circadian pacemaker is also quite high. the threshold irradiance (the minimum irradiance necessary to induce statistically significant responses) is approximately 10(11) photons cm‐2 s‐1 for optimal stimulus durations. this threshold is equivalent to a luminance at the cornea of 0.1 cd m‐2. 5. we also measured the sensitivity of this visual pathway to the total number of photons in a stimulus. this system is maximally sensitive to photons in stimuli between 30 and 3600 s in duration. the maximum quantum efficiency of photic integration occurs in 300 s stimuli. 6. these results suggest that the visual pathways that convey light information to the mammalian circadian pacemaker possess several unique characteristics. these pathways are relatively insensitive to light irradiance and also integrate light inputs over relatively long durations. this visual system, therefore, possesses an optimal sensitivity of ‘tuning’ to total photons delivered in stimuli of several minutes in duration. together these characteristics may make this visual system unresponsive to environmental ‘noise’ that would interfere with the entrainment of circadian rhythms to light‐dark cycles.
β-pix modulates actin-mediated recruitment of synaptic vesicles to synapses most neurons form synapses exclusively with other neurons, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms mediating synaptogenesis in the central nervous system. using an in vitro system, we demonstrate that neuroligin-1 and -2, postsynaptically localized proteins, can trigger the de novo formation of presynaptic structure. nonneuronal cells engineered to express neuroligins induce morphological and functional presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons. this activity can be inhibited by addition of a soluble version of beta-neurexin, a receptor for neuroligin. furthermore, addition of soluble beta-neurexin to a coculture of defined pre- and postsynaptic cns neurons inhibits synaptic vesicle clustering in axons contacting target neurons. our results suggest that neuroligins are part of the machinery employed during the formation and remodeling of cns synapses.
response of skeletal muscle protein synthesis to insulin in suckling pigs decreases with development. neonatal animals utilize their dietary amino acids for protein accretion with high efficiency, and this efficiency declines during early life. the factors responsible for this developmental change are unknown. our objectives were to determine whether amino acid (aa) utilization is stimulated by insulin in the neonate and whether this response changes during the suckling period. two hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp infusion studies, using 10-2,000 ng insulin.kg-0.66.min-1, were performed in 7- and 26-day-old pigs. in study i, no aa were provided during the infusion, and the resultant decline in plasma aa levels was defined. in study ii, plasma aa were clamped at near-fasting levels, and whole body utilization of exogenous aa was determined by measuring the rate of infusion of an aa mixture necessary to maintain basal plasma lysine concentrations. in study i, the half-maximal effective dose (ed50) for the fall in aa concentrations with increasing plasma insulin concentration was lower in 7- than in 26-day-old pigs, and the nadir in aa concentration was achieved by only 20 microu/ml insulin. in study ii, the utilization of exogenous aa during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic aa clamps exhibited a higher maximum response (rmax) (49 vs. 26 mumol aatotal.min-1.kg-1) and a lower ed50 (18 vs. 45 microu insulin/ml) in 7- than in 26-day-old pigs. plasma urea nitrogen concentrations did not rise with increasing insulin and aa infusion rates. these results indicate that insulin stimulates the utilization of exogenous aa in neonatal pigs and that both the insulin sensitivity and responsiveness of aa utilization decline over the suckling period. the infused aa were likely utilized for protein accretion.
children of adolescent mothers: exposure to negative life events and the role of social supports on their socioemotional adjustment this paper has recorded the differential social and medical characteristics of the patient clienteles admitted to private and local authority hospitals in dublin during 1962. the relatively unfavourable socio-economic and medical background of the local authority hospital clientele has been clearly documented. some social, medical and administrative implications of these findings have been considered.
transformation of domain-specific models as foundation for context-awareness in complex systems fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic is a true magnum opus. an enlargement of fuzzy sets, uncertainty,  and information—an earlier work of professor klir and tina folger—fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic  addresses practically every significant topic in the broad expanse of the union of fuzzy set theory  and fuzzy logic. to me fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic is a remarkable achievement; it covers its vast  territory with impeccable authority, deep insight and a meticulous attention to detail.  to view fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic in a proper perspective, it is necessary to clarify a point  of semantics which relates to the meanings of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic.  a frequent source of misunderstanding fias to do with the interpretation of fuzzy logic. the  problem is that the term fuzzy logic has two different meanings. more specifically, in a narrow  sense, fuzzy logic, fln, is a logical system which may be viewed as an extension and generalization  of classical multivalued logics. but in a wider sense, fuzzy logic, fl^ is almost synonymous  with the theory of fuzzy sets. in this context, what is important to recognize is that: (a) flw is much  broader than fln and subsumes fln as one of its branches; (b) the agenda of fln is very different  from the agendas of classical multivalued logics; and (c) at this juncture, the term fuzzy logic is  usually used in its wide rather than narrow sense, effectively equating fuzzy logic with flw  in fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, fuzzy logic is interpreted in a sense that is close to flw. however,  to avoid misunderstanding, the title refers to both fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic.  underlying the organization of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic is a fundamental fact, namely,  that any field x and any theory y can be fuzzified by replacing the concept of a crisp set in x and y  by that of a fuzzy set. in application to basic fields such as arithmetic, topology, graph theory, probability  theory and logic, fuzzification leads to fuzzy arithmetic, fuzzy topology, fuzzy graph theory,  fuzzy probability theory and fln. similarly, hi application to applied fields such as neural network  theory, stability theory, pattern recognition and mathematical programming, fuzzification leads to  fuzzy neural network theory, fuzzy stability theory, fuzzy pattern recognition and fuzzy mathematical  programming. what is gained through fuzzification is greater generality, higher expressive  power, an enhanced ability to model real-world problems and, most importantly, a methodology for  exploiting the tolerance for imprecision—a methodology which serves to achieve tractability,

establishing an empirical link between computer-mediated communication (cmc) and sla: a meta-analysis of the research this paper reports on a study of the use of self-repair among learners of german in a taskbased cmc environment. the purpose of the study was two-fold. the first goal sought to establish how potential interpretations of cmc data may be very different depending on the method of data collection and evaluation employed. the second goal was to explicitly examine the nature of cmc self-repair in the task-based foreign language call classroom. paired participants (n=46) engaged in six jigsaw tasks over the course of one university semester via the chat function in blackboard. chat data were evaluated first by using only the chat log file and second by examining a video file of the screen capture of the entire interaction. results show a fundamental difference in the interpretation of the chat interaction which varies as a function of the data collection and evaluation methods employed. the findings also suggest a possible difference in the nature of self-repair across face-to-face and scmc environments. in view of the results, this paper calls for call researchers to abandon the reliance on printed chat log files when attempting to interpret scmc interactional data.
application of photoluminescent measurement techniques for quantitative assessment of turbine film cooling structural features resulting from the interaction of a turbulent jet issuing transversely into a uniform stream are described with the help of flow visualization and hot-wire anemometry. jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios from 2 to 10 were investigated at crossflow reynolds numbers from 3800 to 11400. in particular, the origin and formation of the vortices in the wake are described and shown to be fundamentally different from the well-known phenomenon of vortex shedding from solid bluff bodies. the flow around a transverse jet does not separate from the jet and does not shed vorticity into the wake. instead, the wake vortices have their origins in the laminar boundary layer of the wall from which the jet issues. it is argued that the closed flow around the jet imposes an adverse pressure gradient on the wall, on the downstream lateral sides of the jet, provoking 'separation events’ in the wall boundary layer on each side. these result in eruptions of boundary-layer fluid and formation of wake vortices that are convected downstream. the measured wake strouhal frequencies, which depend on the jet-crossflow velocity ratio, match the measured frequencies of the separation events. the wake structure is most orderly and the corresponding wake strouhal number (0.13) is most sharply defined for velocity ratios near the value 4. measured wake profiles show deficits of both momentum and total pressure.
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
greatly elevated urea excretion after air exposure appears to be carrier mediated in the slender lungfish (protopterus dolloi) the possible presence of a urea transporter in the kidney of the gulf toadfish (opsanus beta) and further characterization of the pulsatile facilitated transporter previously identified in its gills were investigated by comparing the extra-renal and renal handling of two urea analogues with the handling of urea. toadfish were fitted with caudal artery and indwelling urinary ureteral catheters and injected with an iso-osmotic dose of (14)c-labelled urea analogue (acetamide or thiourea) calculated to bring plasma analogue concentrations close to plasma urea concentrations. branchial permeabilities to urea, acetamide and thiourea were similar during non-pulsing periods and all increased during pulse events, although urea permeability was greater than analogue permeability during pulses. the incidence and magnitude of acetamide and urea pulses at the gills were significantly correlated, acetamide pulses being 35-50 % of the size of urea pulses. however, the thiourea and urea pulses at the gills were only weakly correlated, thiourea pulses being less than 16 % of the size of urea pulses. thiourea inhibited branchial urea excretion by reducing the pulse frequency. the renal handling of thiourea and urea were similar in that both substances were more concentrated in the urine than in the plasma, whereas acetamide was found in equal concentrations in the urine and plasma. urea and thiourea were secreted 2-3 times more effectively than cl(-) and water, whereas acetamide was secreted at a similar relative rate. the differential handling of the urea analogues by the gills and kidney indicates the presence of a different, possibly unique, transporter in the kidney. the movement of thiourea and urea into the renal tubule against an apparent concentration gradient suggests the presence of an active transport mechanism.
reported sexually transmitted disease clinic attendance and sexually transmitted infections in britain: prevalence, risk factors, and proportionate population burden. the health of the nation initiative was launched five years ago in july 1992 with the publication of a white paper.1 the five key areas–coronary heart disease and stroke, cancers, mental illness, accidents, and hiv/aids and sexual health–were given priority and specific objectives, and targets were set. for hiv/aids and sexual health the objective was to reduce the incidence of hiv infection and of other sexually transmitted diseases, with specific targets related to gonorrhoea and conceptions among teenagers. these specific targets were to reduce the incidence of gonorrhoea among men and women aged 15-64 years by at least 20% by 1995 (from 61 new cases per 100 000 population in 1990 to no more than 49) and to reduce the rate of conceptions among girls aged under 16 by at least 50% by the year 2000 (from 9.5 per 1000 girls aged 13-15 in 1989 to no more than 4.8). a closer examination of the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, hiv infection, and conception rates suggests that there is still a long way to go.  ### gonorrhoea  although the target for gonorrhoea has been achieved ahead of time (fig 1), the incidence was declining so rapidly before the target had been defined, and continued to do so afterwards, that it was almost certain to continue declining without any new initiatives. the decline was therefore probably a poor indicator of effective health promotion and improved service delivery by departments of genitourinary medicine.    fig 1  new cases of infection with neisseria gonorrhoeae seen in genitourinary clinics in england, 1988-95    caution is needed when claiming success for the health of the nation programme. new cases of gonorrhoea among homosexual men have not shown a rapid decline (fig 2).2 cases of gonorrhoea seen in genitourinary medicine clinics in the thames regions, reported as acquired through …
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
spatiotemporal evolution of the chlorophyll a trend in the north atlantic ocean. a new ensemble empirical mode decomposition (eemd) is presented. this new approach consists of sifting an ensemble of white noise-added signal (data) and treats the mean as the final true result. finite, not infinitesimal, amplitude white noise is necessary to force the ensemble to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process, thus making the different scale signals to collate in the proper intrinsic mode functions (imf) dictated by the dyadic filter banks. as eemd is a time–space analysis method, the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials; the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal (original data), which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer. the effect of the added white noise is to provide a uniform reference frame in the time–frequency space; therefore, the added noise collates the portion of the signal of comparable scale in one imf. with this ensemble mean, one can separate scales naturall...
comparison of dilution, filtration, and microwave digestion sample pretreatments in elemental profiling of wine by icp-ms the analysis of wine is of great importance since wine components strongly determine its stability, organoleptic or nutrition characteristics. in addition, wine analysis is also important to prevent fraud and to assess toxicological issues. among the different analytical techniques described in the literature, atomic spectrometry has been traditionally employed for elemental wine analysis due to its simplicity and good analytical figures of merit. the scope of this review is to summarize the main advantages and drawbacks of various atomic spectrometry techniques for elemental wine analysis. special attention is paid to interferences (i.e. matrix effects) affecting the analysis as well as the strategies available to mitigate them. finally, latest studies about wine speciation are briefly discussed.
secure trust management with source routing protocol for manets routing protocols are essential to the performance of wireless networks especially in mobile ad-hoc scenarios. the development of new routing protocols requires comparing them against well-known protocols in various simulation environments. in this paper, we present an overview of the well-known manet routing protocols and the implementation details of the dsr routing protocol in the ns-3 network simulator. we verify dsr routing performance under various scenarios and compare its performance against other protocols implemented in ns-3: aodv, dsdv, and olsr. our results show that the performance of dsr shares similar characteristics with aodv yet has slightly higher overall performance results in terms of the routing metrics we use.
a nuclear role for the respiratory enzyme clk-1/coq7 in regulating mitochondrial stress responses and longevity we have identified three allelic, maternal-effect mutations that affect developmental and behavioral timing in caenorhabditis elegans. they result in a mean lengthening of embryonic and postembryonic development, the cell cycle period and life span, as well as the periods of the defecation, swimming and pumping cycles. these mutants also display a number of additional phenotypes related to timing. for example, the variability in the length of embryonic development is several times larger in the mutants than in the wild type, resulting in the occasional production of mutant embryos developing more rapidly than the most rapidly developing wild-type embryos. in addition, the duration of embryonic development of the mutants, but not of the wild type, depends on the temperature at which their parents were raised. finally, individual variations in the severity of distinct mutant phenotypes are correlated in a counterintuitive way. for example, the animals with the shortest embryonic development have the longest defecation cycle and those with the longest embryonic development have the shortest defecation cycle. most of the features affected by these mutations are believed to be controlled by biological clocks, and we therefore call the gene defined by these mutations clk-1, for "abnormal function of biological clocks."
mean field approximation for fields of experts we develop a framework for learning generic, expressive image priors that capture the statistics of natural scenes and can be used for a variety of machine vision tasks. the approach provides a practical method for learning high-order markov random field (mrf) models with potential functions that extend over large pixel neighborhoods. these clique potentials are modeled using the product-of-experts framework that uses non-linear functions of many linear filter responses. in contrast to previous mrf approaches all parameters, including the linear filters themselves, are learned from training data. we demonstrate the capabilities of this field-of-experts model with two example applications, image denoising and image inpainting, which are implemented using a simple, approximate inference scheme. while the model is trained on a generic image database and is not tuned toward a specific application, we obtain results that compete with specialized techniques.

structured output prediction for semantic perception in autonomous vehicles autonomous driving is a key factor for future mobility. properly perceiving the environment of the vehicles is essential for a safe driving, which requires computing accurate geometric and semantic information in real-time. in this paper, we challenge state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for building a perception system for autonomous driving. an inherent drawback in the computation of visual semantics is the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. we propose to circumvent this problem by following an offline-online strategy. during the offline stage dense 3d semantic maps are created. in the online stage the current driving area is recognized in the maps via a re-localization process, which allows to retrieve the pre-computed accurate semantics and 3d geometry in real-time. then, detecting the dynamic obstacles we obtain a rich understanding of the current scene. we evaluate quantitatively our proposal in the kitti dataset and discuss the related open challenges for the computer vision community.
interaction design and evaluation of mobile guides for the museum visit: a case study in multimedia and mobile augmented reality. (etude d'interaction et evaluation de guides portables multimédia pour la visite culturelle: des multimédia à la réalité augmentée mobile) mobivisit (former mobiguide) is the combination of an indoor and outdoor portable tourist guide. the first experimentations took place in lyon, in 2003, on pocket pcs for both the indoor and outdoor guide, on the occasion of a project undertaken by france telecom research and development division. today, the outdoor version of mobivisit is commercialized both for pocket pcs and mobile phones. the goal in lyon was to do a usability test with a multimedia tourist guide, in the city and the surrounding region as well as in the museum of fine arts. much emphasis was placed on examining the continuity of usage between indoor and outdoor cultural settings. during the first three months of the experimentations, approximately 500 tourists borrowed the multimedia guide from the main lyon tourist information office situated on bellecour square to test it free of charge, for a period of one to three days. a second experimentation took place in the museum, with three different target groups: tourists, students and “friends of the museum”, namely senior citizen visitors. the objective of this publication is to share our experience acquired from the mobivisit project, particularly regarding aspects such as barriers in the production of handheld multimedia guides, the means demanded, the various validation tests carried out, the technologies used at the time of production, as well as the results obtained. through this project we also had the opportunity to compare the indoor and the outdoor guide, in relation to the business models, the technologies and the tools developed.
automated classification of mouse pup isolation syllables: from cluster analysis to an excel-based “mouse pup syllable classification calculator” qualitative impairments in communication, such as delayed language and poor interactive communication skills, are fundamental to the diagnosis of autism. investigations into social communication in adult btbr t+tf/j (btbr) mice are needed to determine whether this inbred strain incorporates phenotypes relevant to the second diagnostic symptom of autism, communication deficits, along with its strong behavioral phenotypes relevant to the first and third diagnostic symptoms, impairments in social interactions and high levels of repetitive behavior. the aim of the present study was to simultaneously measure female urine‐elicited scent marking and ultrasonic vocalizations in adult male btbr mice, in comparison with a standard control strain with high sociability, c57bl/6j (b6), for the assessment of a potential communication deficit in btbr. adult male btbr mice displayed lower scent marking and minimal ultrasonic vocalization responses to female urine obtained from both b6 and btbr females. lower scent marking and ultrasonic vocalizations in a social setting by btbr, as compared with b6, are consistent with the well‐replicated social deficits in this inbred mouse strain. our findings support the interpretation that btbr incorporate communication deficits, and suggest that scent marking and ultrasonic vocalizations offer promising measures of interest in social cues that may be widely applicable to investigations of mouse models of autism.
price (protein interface conservation and energetics): a server for the analysis of protein–protein interfaces a core region surrounded by a rim characterizes biological interfaces. we ascertain the importance of the core by showing the sequence entropies of the residues comprising the core to be smaller than those in the rim. such a distinction is not seen in the 2-fold-related, nonphysiological interfaces formed in crystal lattices of monomeric proteins, thereby providing a procedure for characterizing the oligomeric state from crystal structures of protein molecules. this method is better than those that rely on the comparison of the sequence entropies in the interface and the rest of the protein surface, especially in cases where the surface harbors additional binding sites. to a good approximation there is a correlation between the accessible surface area lost because of complexation and δδg values obtained through alanine-scanning mutagenesis (26-38 cal per å2 of the surface buried) for residues located in the core, a relationship that is not discernable for rim residues. if, however, a residue participates in hydrogen bonding across the interface, the extent of stabilization is 52 cal/mol per 1 å2 of the nonpolar surface area buried by the residue. as opposed to an amino acid classification used earlier, an environment-based grouping of residues yields a better discrimination in the sequence entropy between the core and the rim.
characterizing smoking topography of cannabis in heavy users the dsm-iii-r checklist is an efficient method for screening psychiatric patients for major psychiatric disorders while amassing a data base that can be used for later clinical and research activities. it yields valid diagnoses and key adjunctive symptoms. patients enjoyed the interview, demonstrating an interest in the computer as well as a feeling of confidence in the complete review of symptoms. the psychiatry resident users in this project found the checklist to be a valuable teaching instrument, a way to develop their thinking about symptoms and diagnostic rules, an efficient means of collecting an automated clinical data base, and a stimulus to pursue further research activities. finally, the checklist is an ideal diagnostic tool to amass a research data base and is currently being used in numerous studies by clinicians and nonclinicians.
finding loci associated to partial resistance to white pine blister rust in sugar pine (pinus lambertiana dougl.). the majority of genomic research in conifers has been conducted in the pinus subgenus pinus mostly due to the high economic importance of the species within this taxon. genetic maps have been constructed for several of these pines and comparative mapping analyses have consistently revealed notable synteny. in contrast, little genomic research has been conducted on the pinus subgenus strobus, even though these pines have strong ecological relevance. we report a consensus genetic linkage map for sugar pine (pinus lambertiana dougl.) constructed with 399 single nucleotide polymorphisms markers derived from annotated genes. the map is 1,231 cm in length and organized into 19 linkage groups. two of the mapping populations were derived from trees that were segregating for the major gene of resistance (cr1) to cronartium ribicola, the fungal pathogen responsible for white pine blister rust. the third mapping population was derived from a full-sib cross segregating for partial resistance to white pine blister rust. in addition, we report the first comparative mapping study between subgenera strobus and pinus. sixty mapped markers were found in common between sugar pine and the loblolly pine reference map with 56 of them (93%) showing collinearity. all 19 linkage groups of the sugar pine consensus map coaligned to the 12 linkage groups of the loblolly pine reference map. the syntenic relationship observed between these two clades of pines provides a foundation for advancing genomic research and genetic resources in subgenus strobus.
information theoretic learning of robust deep representations motivated in part by the hierarchical organization of the cortex, a number of algorithms have recently been proposed that try to learn hierarchical, or "deep," structure from unlabeled data. while several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area v1 (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms of their fidelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical hierarchy. this paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area v2. specifically, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks of hinton et al. (2006). we learn two layers of nodes in the network, and demonstrate that the first layer, similar to prior work on sparse coding and ica, results in localized, oriented, edge filters, similar to the gabor functions known to model v1 cell receptive fields. further, the second layer in our model encodes correlations of the first layer responses in the data. specifically, it picks up both colinear ("contour") features as well as corners and junctions. more interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex "corner" features matches well with the results from the ito & komatsu's study of biological v2 responses. this suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for modeling more higher-order features.
a novel strategy to produce sweeter tomato fruits with high sugar contents by fruit-specific expression of a single bzip transcription factor gene. sucrose is known to repress the translation of arabidopsis thaliana atbzip11 transcript which encodes a protein belonging to the group of s (s - stands for small) basic region-leucine zipper (bzip)-type transcription factor. this repression is called sucrose-induced repression of translation (sirt). it is mediated through the sucrose-controlled upstream open reading frame (sc-uorf) found in the atbzip11 transcript. the sirt is reported for 4 other genes belonging to the group of s bzip in arabidopsis. tobacco tbz17 is phylogenetically closely related to atbzip11 and carries a putative sc-uorf in its 5′-leader region. here we demonstrate that tbz17 exhibits sirt mediated by its sc-uorf in a manner similar to genes belonging to the s bzip group of the arabidopsis genus. furthermore, constitutive transgenic expression of tbz17 lacking its 5′-leader region containing the sc-uorf leads to production of tobacco plants with thicker leaves composed of enlarged cells with 3–4 times higher sucrose content compared to wild type plants. our finding provides a novel strategy to generate plants with high sucrose content.
using dissortative mating genetic algorithms to track the extrema of dynamic deceptive functions non-random mating seems to be the norm in nature among sexual organisms. a common mating criteria among animals is assortative mating, where individuals mate according to their phenotype similarities (or dissimilarities). this paper explores the effect of including assortative mating in genetic algorithms for dynamic problems. a wide range of mutation rates was explored, since comparative results were found to change drastically for different mutation rates. the strategy for selecting mates was found to interact with the mutation rate value: low mutation rates were the best choice for dissortative mating, medium mutation values for the standard ga, and higher mutation rates for assortative mating. thus, ga efficiency is related to mate selection strategies in connection with mutation values. for low mutation rates typically used in ga, dissortative mating was shown to be a robust and promising strategy for dynamic problems.
physiological equivalent temperature as indicator for impacts of climate change on thermal comfort of humans abstract with considerably increased coverage of weather information in the news media in recent years in many countries, there is also more demand for data that are applicable and useful for everyday life. both the perception of the thermal component of weather as well as the appropriate clothing for thermal comfort result from the integral effects of all meteorological parameters relevant for heat exchange between the body and its environment. regulatory physiological processes can affect the relative importance of meteorological parameters, e.g. wind velocity becomes more important when the body is sweating. in order to take into account all these factors, it is necessary to use a heat-balance model of the human body. the physiological equivalent temperature (pet) is based on the munich energy-balance model for individuals (memi), which models the thermal conditions of the human body in a physiologically relevant way. pet is defined as the air temperature at which, in a typical indoor setting (without wind and solar radiation), the heat budget of the human body is balanced with the same core and skin temperature as under the complex outdoor conditions to be assessed. this way pet enables a layperson to compare the integral effects of complex thermal conditions outside with his or her own experience indoors. on hot summer days, for example, with direct solar irradiation the pet value may be more than 20 k higher than the air temperature, on a windy day in winter up to 15 k lower.
type 2 rhinovirus infection of cultured human tracheal epithelial cells: role of ldl receptor. we have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) enhances expression of interleukin-6, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor genes in human omental microvascular endothelial (home) cells in culture. in this study, we found that treatment of home cells with tnf-alpha or interleukin-1 (il-1) caused enhanced expression of low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor. a few-fold increase in both ldl binding activity and the receptor mrna levels was observed when home cells were treated with either tnf-alpha or il-1. northern blot analysis showed that cellular expression of ldl receptor gene was significantly increased 12-24 h after exposure to tnf-alpha. no significant changes in the life-span of ldl receptor mrna were observed in untreated and tnf-alpha-treated cells. scatchard analysis showed an increased receptor number for ldl in tnf-alpha-treated cells. parallel to increased ldl binding activity, internalization and degradation of ldl were also increased in home cells treated with tnf-alpha or il-1. tnf-alpha-induced enhancement of ldl receptor gene expression was not observed when cycloheximide was present. cellular mrna level of sp-1 gene was increased about 3-4-fold at 12 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription of ldl receptor gene as well as sp-1 gene by tnf-alpha. gel retardation assay with the sp-1 consensus fragment showed that sp-1 binding activity was increased about 4-5-fold 12-24 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nf-kb binding activity was also dramatically increased, but there is no nf-kb motif on the promoter for ldl receptor gene. the induction of ldl receptor by tnf might be mediated through a transcription factor, sp-1.
sacral neuromodulation for combined faecal and urinary incontinence following obstetric anal sphincter injury introduction and hypothesisthis study aims to assess the prevalence of sexual problems in general gynecology and urogynecology clinics using a simple screening tool and to compare the prevalence between patients presenting with gynecology or urogynecology complaints.methodspatients attending (uro)gynecology clinics completed three screening questions for sexual problems to be assessed. a fourth question was later introduced to address sexual problems which bother them. student’s t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression were used.resultsof 1,194 women, 37% had a sexual complaint. seventeen percent volunteered this information as part of their main complaint, while the remaining only admitted it on questioning. the last 290 questionnaires included the question on “bother.” of these, 37% had a sexual complaint and only 45% found them bothersome. multivariate analysis showed that urogynecology complaints were significantly associated with sexual complaints.conclusionsas most women only volunteer symptoms when asked directly, clinicians should be vigilant in identifying sexual problems but always establish the question of bother to avoid over-diagnosis.
the association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(rarβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis background gene expression can be silenced through the methylation of specific sites in the promoter region. this mechanism of gene silencing has an important role in the carcinogenesis of prostate and other cancers. although tumor-associated stromal cells also exhibit changes in gene expression, promoter methylation has not been described in these cells.   methods tumor epithelia, tumor-associated stroma and normal epithelia, and stroma adjacent to tumor tissues were isolated from whole-mount prostatectomy specimens (two per patient) of patients (n = 5) with localized prostate cancer and from normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens (two per patient) from men (n = 5) without prostate cancer by using laser capture microdissection or expression microdissection. the methylation status of three genes important in prostate carcinogenesis, gstp1, rarbeta2, and cd44, were evaluated using quantitative methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction.   results gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in the tumor epithelium of all five prostate cancer patients and in the tumor-associated stroma in four of the five patients. cd44 was methylated in the tumor epithelium from four of the five patients but not in the tumor stroma. gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in normal epithelium of two and four patients, respectively, and in normal stroma of one and two patients, respectively, that were isolated from regions adjacent to the tumors and may have resulted from a tumor-field effect; cd44 methylation was not observed in normal epithelium or stroma. in contrast, normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens showed no promoter methylation in gstp1, rarbeta2, or cd44.   conclusions the observation of promoter methylation in the non-neoplastic cells of the prostate tumor microenvironment may advance our understanding of prostate cancer development and progression and lead to new diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
energy requirements in top-level dancesport athletes a coding scheme is presented for classifying physical activity by rate of energy expenditure, i.e., by intensity. energy cost was established by a review of published and unpublished data. this coding scheme employs five digits that classify activity by purpose (i.e., sports, occupation, self-care), the specific type of activity, and its intensity as the ratio of work metabolic rate to resting metabolic rate (mets). energy expenditure in kilocalories or kilocalories per kilogram body weight can be estimated for all activities, specific activities, or activity types. general use of this coding system would enhance the comparability of results across studies using self reports of physical activity.
improving fine motor function after brain injury using gesture recognition biofeedback backgroundmental practice as an additional cognitive therapy is getting increased attention in stroke rehabilitation. a systematic review shows some evidence that several techniques in which movements are rehearsed mentally might be effective but not enough to be certain. this trial investigates whether mental practice can contribute to a quicker and/or better recovery of stroke in two dutch nursing homes. the objective is to investigate the therapeutic potential of mental practice embedded in daily therapy to improve individually chosen daily activities of adult stroke patients compared to therapy as usual. in addition, we will investigate prognostic variables and feasibility (process evaluation).methodsa randomised, controlled, observer masked prospective trial will be conducted with adult stroke patients in the (sub)acute phase of stroke recovery. over a six weeks intervention period the control group will receive multi professional therapy as usual. patients in the experimental group will be instructed how to perform mental practice, and will receive care as usual in which mental practice is embedded in physical, occupation and speech therapy sessions. outcome will be assessed at six weeks and six months. the primary outcome measure is the patient-perceived effect on performance of daily activities as assessed by an 11-point likert scale. secondary outcomes are: motricity index, nine hole peg test, barthel index, timed up and go, 10 metres walking test, rivermead mobility index. a sample size of the patients group and all therapists will be interviewed on their opinion of the experimental program to assess feasibility. all patients are asked to keep a log to determine unguided training intensity.discussionadvantages and disadvantages of several aspects of the chosen design are discussed.trial registrationisrctn27582267
is the rapid adaptation paradigm too rapid? implications for face and object processing one of the most robust experience-related cortical dynamics is reduced neural activity when stimuli are repeated. this reduction has been linked to performance improvements due to repetition and also used to probe functional characteristics of neural populations. however, the underlying neural mechanisms are as yet unknown. here, we consider three models that have been proposed to account for repetition-related reductions in neural activity, and evaluate them in terms of their ability to account for the main properties of this phenomenon as measured with single-cell recordings and neuroimaging techniques. we also discuss future directions for distinguishing between these models, which will be important for understanding the neural consequences of repetition and for interpreting repetition-related effects in neuroimaging data.
lack of association between iron status at birth and growth of preterm infants. the ballard maturational score was refined and expanded to achieve greater accuracy and to include extremely premature neonates. to test validity, accuracy, interrater reliability, and optimal postnatal age at examination, the resulting new ballard score (nbs) was assessed for 578 newly born infants and the results were analyzed. gestational ages ranged from 20 to 44 weeks and postnatal ages at examination ranged from birth to 96 hours. in 530 infants, gestational age by last menstrual period was confirmed by agreement within 2 weeks with gestational age by prenatal ultrasonography (c-glmp). for these infants, correlation between gestational age by nbs and c-glmp was 0.97. mean differences between gestational age by nbs and c-glmp were 0.32 +/- 1.58 weeks and 0.15 +/- 1.46 weeks among the extremely premature infants (less than 26 weeks) and among the total population, respectively. correlations between the individual criteria and c-glmp ranged from 0.72 to 0.82. interrater reliability of nbs, as determined by correlation between raters who rated the same subgroup of infants, ws 0.95. for infants less than 26 weeks of gestational age, the greatest validity (97% within 2 weeks of c-glmp) was seen when the examination was performed before 12 hours of postnatal age. for infants at least 26 weeks of gestational age, percentages of agreement with c-glmp remained constant, averaging 92% for all postnatal age categories up to 96 hours. the nbs is a valid and accurate gestational assessment tool for extremely premature infants and remains valid for the entire newborn infant population.
product approximation by minimizing the upper bound of bayes error rate for bayesian combination of classifiers this paper proposes a simple yet highly accurate system for the recognition or unconstrained handwritten numerals. it starts with an examination of the basic characteristic loci (cl) features used along with a nearest neighbor classifier achieving a recognition rate of 90.5%. we then illustrate how the basic cl implementation can be extended and used in conjunction with a multilayer perception neural network classifier to increase the recognition rate to 98%. this proposed recognition system was tested on a totally unconstrained handwritten numeral database while training it with only 600 samples exclusive from the test set. an accuracy exceeding 98% is also expected if a larger training set is used. lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system its performance is also compared to that of some other common recognition schemes. these systems use moment invariants as features along with nearest neighbor classification schemes.
the discourse of sibling violence domestic violence professionals have debated whether all physical assaults by partners should be labeled abuse. this study examined the use of labels such as “abuse,” “victim,” and “battered woman” in a sample of women (n = 78) who had sustained at least one physical assault in their current or most recent relationship. self-labeling followed a differentiating strategy, that is, women experiencing more frequent and more severe assaults were more likely to apply labels. lower partner income, being black, lower relationship commitment, and having ended the relationship also were associated with increased self-labeling. labeling of hypothetical acts followed an inclusive strategy, that is, all assaults were considered abusive. these results suggest that contextual factors influence labeling. prevention and intervention programs may be able to increase their effectiveness by including more situational context in their messages.
assessment of transcapillary glucose exchange in human skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. intracellular glucose concentration in skeletal muscle of awake rats was determined under conditions of hyperglycemic (10.2 ± 0.6 mm) hyperinsulinemia (∼1,200 pm) and hyperglycemic (20.8 ± 1.5 mm) hypoinsulinemia (<12 pm) by use of13c nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy during a prime-constant infusion of [1-13c]glucose and [1-13c]mannitol with either insulin (10 mu ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ min-1) or somatostatin (1.0 μg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ min-1). intracellular glucose was calculated as the difference between the concentrations of total tissue glucose (calculated from the in vivo13c nmr spectrum with mannitol as an internal concentration standard) and extracellular glucose, corrected by the ratio of intra- and extracellular water space. extracellular concentration was corrected for an interstitial fluid-to-plasma glucose concentration gradient of 0.83 ± 0.07, determined by open-flow microperfusion. the mean ratio of intra- to extracellular glucose space, determined from the relative nmr signal intensities and concentrations of mannitol and total creatine, was 9.2 ± 1.1 (hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemia, n = 10), and 9.0 ± 1.7 (hyperglycemic hypoinsulinemia, n= 7). mean muscle intracellular glucose concentration was <0.07 mm under hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions ( n = 10) and 0.32 ± 0.06 mm under hyperglycemic-hypoinsulinemic conditions ( n = 7). this method is noninvasive and should prove useful for resolving the question of whether glucose transport or phosphorylation is responsible for the reduced rate of muscle glycogen synthesis observed in diabetic subjects.
unusual configurations of personality traits indicate multiple patterns of their coalescence it is argued that if we compute self-other agreement on some personality traits then we possess no or very little information about the individuals who are the targets of this judgment. this idea is largely based on two separate ways of computing self-other agreement: trait agreement (rt) and profile agreement (rp), which are typically associated with two different trait-centered and person-centered approaches in personality research. personality traits of 4115 targets from czech, belgian, estonian, and german samples were rated by themselves and knowledgeable informants. we demonstrate that trait agreement can be partialled into individual contributions so that it is possible to show how much each individual pair of judges contributes to agreement on a particular trait. similarly, it is possible to decompose agreement between two personality profiles into the individual contributions of traits from which these profiles are assembled. if normativeness is separated from distinctiveness of personality scores and individual profiles are ipsatized, then mean profile agreement rp becomes identical to mean trait agreement rt. the views that trait-by-trait analysis does not provide information regarding accuracy level of a particular pair of judges and profile analysis does not permit assessment of the relative contributions of traits to overall accuracy are not supported.
model reduction for multiscale lithium-ion battery simulation in a companion paper (bastian et al. 2007, this issue) we introduced an abstract definition of a parallel and adaptive hierarchical grid for scientific computing. based on this definition we derive an efficient interface specification as a set of c++ classes. this interface separates the applications from the grid data structures. thus, user implementations become independent of the underlying grid implementation. modern c++ template techniques are used to provide an interface implementation without big performance losses. the implementation is realized as part of the software environment dune (http://dune-project.org/). numerical tests demonstrate the flexibility and the efficiency of our approach.
using a dependency parser to improve smt for subject-object-verb languages conditional maximum entropy (me) models provide a general purpose machine learning technique which has been successfully applied to fields as diverse as computer vision and econometrics, and which is used for a wide variety of classification problems in natural language processing. however, the flexibility of me models is not without cost. while parameter estimation for me models is conceptually straightforward, in practice me models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. in this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of me models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. sur-prisingly, the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric algorithm outperformed the other choices.
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a2 is a common transcriptional coactivator in the nuclear transcription response to mitochondrial respiratory stress. the environmental toxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (tcdd) is a known human carcinogen; however, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. here we show that tcdd induces mitochondrial dysfunction, stress signaling, and tumor invasion by a mechanism similar to that described for mtdna-depleted cells. treatment of c2c12 cells with tcdd disrupted mitochondrial transmembrane potential in a time-dependent fashion and inhibited mitochondrial transcription and translation. tcdd also increased cytosolic [ca2+]c and ryr1-specific ca2+ release. these changes were associated with increased calcineurin (cna) levels and activation of cna-sensitive nf-κb/rel (iκbβ-dependent) factors. cells treated with tcdd displayed resistance to apoptosis, increased expression of the tumor marker cathepsin l, and a high degree of invasiveness as tested by the matrigel membrane invasion assay. these effects were reversed by the cna inhibitor fk506, and cna mrna silencing suggesting that tcdd triggers a signaling pathway similar to mtdna depletion. taken together, these results reveal that tcdd may promote tumor progression in vivo by directly targeting mitochondrial transcription and induction of mitochondrial stress signaling.
shape prior modeling using sparse representation and online dictionary learning sparse coding---that is, modelling data vectors as sparse linear combinations of basis elements---is widely used in machine learning, neuroscience, signal processing, and statistics. this paper focuses on learning the basis set, also called dictionary, to adapt it to specific data, an approach that has recently proven to be very effective for signal reconstruction and classification in the audio and image processing domains. this paper proposes a new online optimization algorithm for dictionary learning, based on stochastic approximations, which scales up gracefully to large datasets with millions of training samples. a proof of convergence is presented, along with experiments with natural images demonstrating that it leads to faster performance and better dictionaries than classical batch algorithms for both small and large datasets.
systematic review of factors influencing length of stay in icu after adult cardiac surgery objective:followingcardiacsurgery, agreat varietyinintensivecareunit(icu)stayis observed,makingitoftendifficulttoadequatelypredict icu stay preoperatively. therefore, a study was conducted to investigate, which preoperative variables are independent risk factors for a prolonged icu stay and whether a patient’s risk of experiencing an extended icu stay can be estimated from these predictors. methods: the records of 1566 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution were analysed retrospectively over a 2-year period. procedures included in the analyses were coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement or repair, ascending and aortic arch surgery, ventricular rupture and aneurysm repair, septal myectomy and cardiac tumour surgery. for this patient group, icu stay was registered and 57 preoperative variables were collected for analysis. descriptives and log-rank tests were calculated and kaplan—meier curves drawn for all variables. significant predictors in the univariate analyses were included in a cox proportional hazards model. the definitive model was validated on an independent sample of 395 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution over an additional 6-month period. in this patient group, the accuracy and discriminative abilities of the model were evaluated. results: twelve independent preoperative predictors of prolonged icu stay were identified: age at surgery > 75 years, female gender, dyspnoea status > new york heart association class ii (nyha ii), unstable symptoms, impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) colour flow mapping (cfm) grade ii, inotropic support, intra-aortic balloon pumping (iabp), non-elective procedures and aortic surgery. the individual effect of every predictor on icu stay was quantified and inserted into a mathematical algorithm (called the morbidity defining cardiosurgical (mdc) index), making it possible to calculate a patient’s risk of having an extended icu stay. the model showed very good calibration and very good to excellent discriminative ability in predicting icu stay >2, >5 and >7 days (c-statistic of 0.78; 0.82 and 0.85, respectively). conclusions: twelve independent preoperative risk factors for a prolonged icu stay following cardiac surgery were identified and constructed into a proportional hazards model. using this risk model, one can predict whether a patient will have a prolonged icu stay or not. # 2010 european association for cardio-thoracic surgery. published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
pleiotrophin modulates morphine withdrawal but has no effects on morphine-conditioned place preference the social group experience of mice with opposite aggressive and nonaggressive behavioral strategies was examined to modulate reinforcing effects of morphine and cocaine. highly aggressive and nonaggressive male mice cohoused for long period in three-member groups were tested to self-administrate the drugs and to develop conditioned place preferring by them. mouse triads formed by principle of descending aggression were used as a model of linear hierarchical group. the level of mouse aggression was identified previously within the stock group and during encounter with unknown intruder that continued to be stable over the time of experiment. highly aggressive mice self-administered morphine and cocaine at higher unit concentrations (1.5 and 1.5 mg/ml) as compare with nonaggressive animals (0.5 and 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg/ml). both morphine (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg) and cocaine (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) induced conditioned place preference in nonaggressive mice at all doses. in contrast, morphine had no effect in highly aggressive mice, while cocaine induced place conditioning at the highest doses (10 mg/kg) only. our results illustrate that social experience in a stable group alter mouse sensitivity to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse and social state should be taken into account in the experiments when social interactions are present.
subcellular trafficking of the arabidopsis auxin influx carrier aux1 uses a novel pathway distinct from pin1[w] plants have many polarized cell types, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms that establish polarity. the orc mutant was identified originally by defects in root patterning, and positional cloning revealed that the affected gene encodes sterol methyltransferase1, which is required for the appropriate synthesis and composition of major membrane sterols. smt1orc mutants displayed several conspicuous cell polarity defects. columella root cap cells revealed perturbed polar positioning of different organelles, and in the smt1orc root epidermis, polar initiation of root hairs was more randomized. polar auxin transport and expression of the auxin reporter dr5-β-glucuronidase were aberrant in smt1orc. patterning defects in smt1orc resembled those observed in mutants of the pin gene family of putative auxin efflux transporters. consistently, the membrane localization of the pin1 and pin3 proteins was disturbed in smt1orc, whereas polar positioning of the influx carrier aux1 appeared normal. our results suggest that balanced sterol composition is a major requirement for cell polarity and auxin efflux in arabidopsis.
hormone replacement and strength training positively influence balance during gait in post-menopausal females: a pilot study. this study employed manipulation of sensory inputs (vision and plantar-surface cutaneous sensation) during gait termination to elicit insight into the roles played by these sensory systems in the control of gait termination. attenuation of cutaneous sensation was achieved through hypothermic anesthesia. visual information was occluded using special glasses. the subjects were asked to walk along an 8 m walkway and during randomly selected trials (25% of trials) to terminate their gait in a predetermined area. the centre of mass (com) was obtained in order to provide an indication of the efficiency and stability during termination when sensory inputs were manipulated. lack of visual information delayed the initiation of the slowing down of the com forward progression and increased the step length of the last step of termination. additionally, lack of vision resulted in the com moving closer to the base of support (bos) during double support and more variability, in the com, when attempting to achieve a final stable position. insensitivity of the plantar-surface mechanoreceptors led to a longer second step and a more variable foot placement of the first step, and increased the loading rate during the final two steps of termination. additionally when vision and cutaneous information were absent the resolution of the final stable position was not as effectively controlled. the results demonstrated that visual information about self-motion and object-motion and sensation from the plantar surface of the foot play phase-specific roles in the control of com during gait termination.
preserving and using germplasm and dissociated embryonic cells for conserving caribbean and pacific coral fungia scutaria spawned vigorously with a lunar beriodicity during the summer months of 1981 and 1982. spawning activity declined in the fall of both years and was absent in winter and spring (1983). there was only one short spawning event per lunar cycle. each event occurred in the evening between 1700 and 1900 hours 1 to 4 days following the full moon. fungia scutaria exhibits gonochorism. females ejected eggs through their mouths into the seawater above. many of these negatively buoyant eggs settled onto the oral discs and were moved off the edge by ciliary-mucoid activity. spermatoza from males were similarly expelled in a jet of gastrovascular fluid. spawned eggs were small and lacked endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. rapid development led to ciliated solid planulae by the next morning. within 24 h a mouth had begun to develop. planulae may have been able to feed within 39 h. infection with zooxanthellae occurred 4–5 days following spawning. planulae may have become competent for settlement by 7 days, but attempts to docment settlement produced ambiguous results.
quadratic regularization with cubic descent for unconstrained optimization ∗ in this work we propose a class of quasi-newton methods to minimize a twice differentiable function with lipschitz continuous hessian. these methods are based on the quadratic regularization of newton’s method, with algebraic explicit rules for computing the regularizing parameter. the convergence properties of this class of methods are analysed. we show that if the sequence generated by the algorithm converges then its limit point is stationary. we also establish local quadratic convergence in a neighborhood of a stationary point with positive definite hessian. encouraging numerical experiments are presented.
prevalence, associated factors and predictors of depression among adults in the community of selangor, malaysia introduction anxiety is a common mental health disorder in primary care, with a higher prevalence among women compared to men.   aim this is the first study to validate the generalised anxiety disorder-7 questionnaire (gad-7) as a case-finding instrument for anxiety in a primary care setting in malaysia. the objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the malay version of the gad-7 in detecting anxiety among women.   methods this cross-sectional study was conducted in a government-funded primary care clinic in malaysia. consecutive women participants attending the clinic during data collection were given self-administered questionnaires including the gad-7 (malay version). participants then were selected using systematic weighted random sampling for composite international diagnostic interviews (cidi). the gad-7 was validated against the cidi reference standard.   results the response rate was 87.5% for the questionnaire completion (895/1023), and 96.8% for diagnostic interviews (151/156). the prevalence of anxiety was 7.8%. the gad-7 had a sensitivity of 76% (95% ci 61%-87%), a specificity of 94% (88%-97%), positive lr 13.7 (6.2-30.5) and negative lr 0.25 (0.14-0.45).   discussion the malay version of the gad-7 was found to be valid and reliable in case-finding for anxiety in this study. due to its brevity, it is a suitable case-finding instrument for detecting anxiety in primary care settings in malaysia.
single-pass k-svd for efficient dictionary learning the k-means method is a widely used clustering technique that seeks to minimize the average squared distance between points in the same cluster. although it offers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very appealing in practice. by augmenting k-means with a very simple, randomized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is θ(logk)-competitive with the optimal clustering. preliminary experiments show that our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.
augmenting human-human interaction in mobile group improvisation this paper reviews and extends questions of the scope of an interactive musical instrument and mapping strategies for expressive performance. we apply notions of embodiment and affordance to characterize gestural instruments. we note that the democratization of sensor technology in consumer devices has extended the cultural contexts for interaction. we revisit questions of mapping drawing upon the theory of affordances to consider mapping and instrument together.    this is applied to recent work by the author and his collaborators in the development of instruments based on mobile devices designed for specific performance situations.
temporal variability in bioassays of the stomatal ammonia compensation point in relation to plant and soil nitrogen parameters in intensively managed grassland a vacuum infiltration technique was developed that enabled the extraction of apoplastic solution with very little cytoplasmic contamination as evident from a malate dehydrogenase activity of less than 1% in the apoplastic solution relative to that in bulk leaf extracts. the volume of apoplastic water, a prerequisite for determination of the concentration of apoplastic solutes, was determined by vacuum infiltration of indigo carmine with subsequent analysis of the dilution of the dye in apoplastic extracts. indigo carmine was neither transported across the cell membrane nor significantly adsorbed to the cell walls, ensuring reproducible (se < 2%) and precise determination of apoplastic water. analysis of leaves from four different positions on senescing brassica napus plants showed a similar apoplastic ph of 5.8, while apoplastic nh4+ increased from 1.1 mm in lower leaves to 1.3 mm in upper leaves. inhibition of glutamine synthetase in young b. napus plants resulted in increasing apoplastic ph from 6.0 to 6.8 and increasing apoplastic nh4+ concentration from 1.0 to 25.6 mm, followed by a marked increase in nh3 emission. calculating nh3 compensation points for b. napus plants on the basis of measured apoplastic h+ and nh4+ concentrations gave values ranging from 4.3 to 5.9 nmol nh3 mol-1 air, consistent with an estimate of 5.3 [plus or minus] 3.6 nmol nh3 mol-1 air obtained by nh3 exchange experiments in growth chambers. a strong linear relationship was found between calculated nh3 compensation points and measured nh3 emission rates in glutamine synthetase-inhibited plants.
developing practice and staff: enabling improvement in care delivery through participatory action research background lecturer practitioner roles are well established in the united kingdom. the national literature demonstrates that these staff are valuable to national health service trusts and universities however, their roles are busy and demanding, with conflicting expectations from the two employers. in addition, their role in addressing the theory-practice gap - a major reason for their establishment - is at best unclear. although a number of qualitative studies have explored the topic, there have been no systematic attempts to develop the role or to quantify the effects on postholders.   aim this paper reports a study that aimed to develop aspects of lecturer practitioners' work roles, examine the effects of this on individuals at one english university, and to quantify lecturer practitioners' occupational stress and burnout.   methods a flexible, 'spiral' action research framework and 'collaborative group approach' were used, with mixed methods of data collection. data were collected through focus groups, meetings and participant feedback, and participants' reflective diaries. a questionnaire using previously validated psychological attitude rating scales was also used to measure occupational stress and burnout, the extent to which the project influenced these, and the influence of lecturer practitioners' experience and qualifications. six null hypotheses were constructed to measure these ideas. findings from qualitative and quantitative perspectives were triangulated to give depth to the analysis.   findings five themes emerged from the focus groups: personal motivation, workload pressures, role clarity, preparation and support, and gains from the role. specific policies and documentation were developed as a result of this initial project planning work. the findings from the questionnaire indicated that lecturer practitioners were no more stressed or burnt out than comparable workers. synthesis of findings indicated, broadly speaking, that these lps were 'thriving rather than just surviving'.   conclusion action research was an effective methodology for uncovering new knowledge, and bringing about organizational change in this project.
asymptotic throughput of stochastic max-plus linear systems the lower and average spectral radii measure, respectively, the minimal and average growth rates of long products of matrices taken from a finite set. the logarithm of the average spectral radius is traditionally called the lyapunov exponent. when one performs these products in the max-algebra, we obtain quantities that measure the performance of discrete event systems. we show that approximating the lower and average max-algebraic spectral radii is np-hard.
enhancing masculinity by slandering homosexuals two experiments tested whether the relation between automatic prejudice and discriminatory behavior is moderated by 2 conscious processes: conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the authors predicted that, when both conscious processes are deactivated, automatic prejudice would elicit discriminatory behavior. when either of the 2 processes is activated, behavioral bias would be eliminated. the authors assessed participants' automatic attitudes toward gay men, conscious beliefs about gender, behavioral control, and interactions with gay confederates. in experiment 1, men's beliefs about gender were heterogeneous, whereas women's beliefs were mostly egalitarian; men's responses supported the predictions, but women's responses did not. in experiment 2, the authors recruited a sample with greater diversity in gender-related beliefs. results showed that, for both sexes, automatic prejudice produced biased behavior in the absence of conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the presence of either conscious process eliminated behavioral bias.
validation of the persian version of the fear avoidance belief questionnaire in patients with low back pain. we asked patients to assess their functional health status by completing the sf-36. over 2 years, we studied 1,000 patients (average age, 58 years; 50% male; 25% white; 36% diabetic) in three outpatient, staff-assisted hemodialysis units. we used both the eight-scale scores and two-component summary scores to study the relationship between baseline functional health status and clinical outcomes. the physical component summary (pcs) score was as significant a predictor of mortality as was the normalized protein catabolic rate or the delivered kt/v. patients with a pcs score below the median for our patients (< 34) were twice as likely to die and 1.5 times more likely to be hospitalized as patients with pcs scores at or above the median score. either a low pcs score or a low mental component summary (mcs) score correlated with the number of days of hospitalization. while the average dialysis patient has a relatively normal (47 v 50) mcs score and a low (37 v 50) pcs score compared with the normal population, patients who skipped more than two treatments per month tended to have a relatively higher pcs score (judged themselves physically healthier) and a relatively lower mcs score (judged themselves less mentally healthy) than patients who did not skip two or more treatments per month. the prevalence of depression as defined by an mcs score of < or = 42 was approximately 25%. the sf-36 provided a good screening tool for patients at high risk for death, hospitalization, poor attendance, and depression.
diastolic function and patient-reported quality of life for adolescents and adults with repaired tetralogy of fallot: a tissue doppler study this study demonstrated that the tdi-tei index correlates well with the tei index determined by pulsed doppler, and thus represents a simple method of assessing rv myocardial performance. moreover, the tdi-tei index has the advantage of simultaneous recording of systolic and diastolic velocity patterns, suggesting that the tdi-tei index is a feasible approach to assess global rv function in children.
the optimal route of administration of the glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor antagonist abciximab during percutaneous coronary intervention; intravenous versus intracoronary during the last two decades, significant advances have been made in the understanding of atherosclerotic disease. the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis appears to depend on a precise sequence of critical events based on the interaction of blood elements and lipids with the arterial wall. the major critical events and their sequence appears to be as follows: hemodynamic stress and endothelial injury; arterial wall-platelet interaction; smooth muscle cell proliferation; lipid entry and accumulation; significant arterial narrowing with fibrosis and development of thrombi; and complications in the form of calcification, ulceration, aneurysm, acute thrombotic occlusion and embolization. this sequence of critical events starts at a young age and in all geographic racial groups. their evolution into advanced symptomatic lesions takes many years and varies in incidence and extent among different geographic and ethnic groups. it appears that in promoting and accelerating this process into the advanced stage of the disease, the presence at a young age of the so-called risk factors of atherosclerotic disease is most important. the recent advances in the understanding of the atherosclerotic process will be highlighted in this chapter with particular attention being focused on the role of platelets and thrombosis in the development of the disease and the possible role of platelet inhibitor drugs on the prevention of coronary atherosclerotic disease.
sleep-dependent facilitation of episodic memory details episodic memories are characterized by their contextual richness, yet little is known about how the various features comprising an episode are brought together in memory. here we employed fmri and a multidimensional source memory procedure to investigate processes supporting the mnemonic binding of item and contextual information. volunteers were scanned while encoding items for which the contextual features (color and location) varied independently, allowing activity elicited at the time of study to be segregated according to whether both, one, or neither feature was successfully retrieved on a later memory test. activity uniquely associated with successful encoding of both features was identified in the intra-parietal sulcus, a region strongly implicated in the support of attentionally mediated perceptual binding. the findings suggest that the encoding of disparate features of an episode into a common memory representation requires that the features be conjoined in a common perceptual representation when the episode is initially experienced.
mutations in the sepiapterin reductase gene cause a novel tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent monoamine-neurotransmitter deficiency without hyperphenylalaninemia. a variant type of hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), the obligatory cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. the most frequent form of this cofactor deficiency is due to lack of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (ptps) activity, the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for bh4. the human liver cdna for ptps was previously isolated, and the recombinant protein was found to be active when expressed in escherichia coli. we now have investigated two patients for their molecular nature of this autosomal recessive disorder. both patients were diagnosed as ptps deficient, one with the central and one with the peripheral form, on the basis of an elevated serum phenylalanine concentration concomitant with lowered levels of urinary biopterin and ptps activity in erythrocytes. molecular analysis was performed on the patients' cultured primary skin fibroblasts. ptps activities were found in vitro to be reduced to background activity. direct cdna sequence analysis using reverse transcriptase-pcr technology showed for the patient with the central from a homozygous g-to-a transition at codon 25, causing the replacement of an arginine by glutamine (r25q). expression of this mutant allele in e. coli revealed 14% activity when compared with the wild-type enzyme. the patient with the peripheral form exhibited compound heterozygosity, having on one allele a c-to-t transition resulting in the substitution of arginine 16 for cysteine (r16c) in the enzyme and having on the second allele a 14-bp deletion (delta 14bp), leading to a frameshift at lysine 120 and a premature stop codon (k120-->stop). heterologous expression of the enzyme with the single-amino-acid exchange r16c revealed only 7% enzyme activity, whereas expression of the deletion allele delta 14bp exhibited no detectable activity. all three mutations, r25q, r16c, and k120-->stop, affect evolutionarily conserved residues in ptps, result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstituted in e. coli, and are thus believed to be the molecular cause for the bh4 deficiency. this is the first report describing mutations in ptps that lead to bh4 deficiency.
common mental disorders during pregnancy: prevalence and associated factors among low-income women in são paulo, brazil background the general health questionnaire (ghq) has been validated in different languages and cultures and in diverse settings. however, the validity of the 12-item version, increasingly used for screening for psychiatric morbidity in primary care, has not been established among ethnic indians living in the united kingdom.   methods the ghq-12 was used to screen for psychiatric morbidity in a study of patterns of consultation and explanatory models of mental illness in a general practice in west london. all individuals who scored 2 or more and an equal number of individuals who scored 0 or 1 were interviewed using the revised clinical interview schedule (cis-r) to confirm psychiatric morbidity. hindi versions of the both these instruments were also employed. thresholds of ghq were compared against the standard of the cis-r using the recommended threshold of 12 and above as indicating caseness. a receiver operator characteristic curve was drawn to obtain the best threshold value for screening.   results the optimal threshold for screening as assessed by receiver operator characteristic analysis was 2/3. this threshold had a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 90%.   conclusions the sensitivity and specificity of the 12-item general health questionnaire among women of ethnic indian origin living in the united kingdom is high. it can be employed as a screening instrument to identify individuals with psychiatric morbidity in this population.
soy protein is beneficial but high-fat diet and voluntary running are detrimental to bone structure in mice. we investigated the effects of diet (ain93g or high-fat), physical activity (sedentary or voluntary running), and protein source (casein or soy protein isolate (spi)) and their interactions on metabolic disturbance and inflammation in mice. after 14 weeks of feeding, the high-fat diet increased body weight gain by 34.5% (p < 0.01), whereas running reduced weight gain by 30.5% (p < 0.01) compared to their respective ain93g and sedentary controls; spi did not affect weight gain. the high-fat diet significantly increased plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, leptin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (mcp-1); running and spi significantly reduced these parameters compared to their respective controls. the high-fat diet significantly increased and running significantly reduced plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. a unique finding was that spi supplementation to the high-fat diet reduced plasma insulin by 11% (p < 0.05), mcp-1 by 21% (p = 0.03), and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) by 50% (p = 0.05) compared to casein. as adipose tissues produce many adipocytokines, including mcp-1 and tnf-α, that contribute to a state of chronic low grade systemic inflammation and facilitate metabolic disturbance in obesity, further investigations are warranted into the roles of soy protein in reducing the risk of obesity.
depressive symptoms are associated with analgesic use in people with alzheimer’s disease: kuopio alsova study the 15d is a generic, comprehensive, 15-dimensional, standardized, self-administered measure of health-related quality of life (hrqol) that can be used both as a profile and single index score measure. this paper examines the acceptability, reliability, validity, discriminatory power and responsiveness to change of its health state descriptive system and valuation system and presents some examples of applications. as a profile measure on roughly comparable dimensions the 150 performs equally well as the nottingham health profile (nhp) and sf-20, in some respects even better, and clearly better than eq-5d. the remaining nine to ten dimensions of the 15d provide a large reserve in terms of discriminatory power and responsiveness to change. the valuation system is based on an application of the multiattribute utility theory. the single index score (15d score) on a 0–1 scale, representing the overall hrqol, is calculated from the health state descriptive system by using a set of population-based preference or utility weights. the 15d scores are shown to be highly reliable, sensitive and responsive to change, generalisable at least in western-type societies, and particularly valid for deriving quality-adjusted life years (qalys) gained for resource allocation purposes. the instrument is recommended by the washington panel and is available in several languages for clinical economic evaluation and population studies.
health care payments in vietnam: patients’ quagmire of caring for health versus economic destitution there are only a few studies performed on multinomial logistic regression on the benzene-exposed occupational group. a study was carried out to assess the relationship between the benzene concentration and trans-trans-muconic acid (t,t-ma), biomarkers in urine samples from petrol filling workers. a total of 117 workers involved in this occupation were selected for this current study. generally, logistic regression analysis (lr) is a common statistical technique that could be used to predict the likelihood of categorical or binary or dichotomous outcome variables. the multinomial logistic regression equations were used to predict the relationship between benzene concentration and t,t-ma. the results showed a significant correlation between benzene and t,t-ma among the petrol fillers. prediction equations were estimated by adopting the physical characteristic viz., age, experience in years and job categories of petrol filling station workers. interestingly, there was no significant difference observed among experience in years. petrol fillers and cashiers having a higher occupational risk were in the age group of ≤24 and between 25 and 34 years. among the petrol fillers, the t,t-ma levels with exceeding acgih twa-tlv level was showing to be more significant. this study demonstrated that multinomial logistic regression is an effective model for profiling the greatest risk of the benzene-exposed group caused by different explanatory variables.
increased intramuscular lipid synthesis and low saturation relate to insulin sensitivity in endurance-trained athletes. hyperinsulinemia is common in obesity, but whether it plays a role in intramyocellular triglyceride (imctg) buildup is unknown. in this study, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments were performed in overnight-fasted lean and high-fat-fed obese rats, awake, to determine the effect of insulin on imctg synthesis (incorporation of [14c]glycerol, [14c]glucose, and [3h]oleate). insulin infusion at 25 (low insulin) and 100 (high insulin) pmol/kg/min increased plasma insulin by 5- and 16-fold, respectively, whereas plasma and intramyocellular glycerol, ffas, triglycerides, and glucose levels were maintained at their basal levels by co-infusion of exogenous glycerol, ffas, and triglycerides at fixed rates and glucose at varying rates. in obese rats, insulin suppressed incorporation of glycerol into the imctg-glycerol moiety dose dependently (p < 0.01–p < 0.001) in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior, but only the high insulin suppressed it in soleus (p < 0.05). the low insulin suppressed glucose incorporation into imctg-glycerol in all three muscles (p = 0.01–p < 0.01). however, the low insulin did not affect (p > 0.05) and the high insulin suppressed (p < 0.05–p < 0.01) fatty acid incorporation into imctg in all three muscles. insulin also suppressed glycerol incorporation in lean rats (p < 0.01–p < 0.04). on the other hand, imctg pool size was not affected by insulin (p > 0.05). these observations suggest that acute hyperinsulinemia inhibits imctg synthesis and thus does not appear to promote imctg accumulation via the synthetic pathway, at least in the short term.
investigating sources of heterogeneity in randomized controlled trials of the effects of pharmacist interventions on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis backgroundour objective was to develop an instrument to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews, building upon previous tools, empirical evidence and expert consensus.methodsa 37-item assessment tool was formed by combining 1) the enhanced overview quality assessment questionnaire (oqaq), 2) a checklist created by sacks, and 3) three additional items recently judged to be of methodological importance. this tool was applied to 99 paper-based and 52 electronic systematic reviews. exploratory factor analysis was used to identify underlying components. the results were considered by methodological experts using a nominal group technique aimed at item reduction and design of an assessment tool with face and content validity.resultsthe factor analysis identified 11 components. from each component, one item was selected by the nominal group. the resulting instrument was judged to have face and content validity.conclusiona measurement tool for the 'assessment of multiple systematic reviews' (amstar) was developed. the tool consists of 11 items and has good face and content validity for measuring the methodological quality of systematic reviews. additional studies are needed with a focus on the reproducibility and construct validity of amstar, before strong recommendations can be made on its use.
the development of a genome wide snp set for the barnacle goose branta leucopsis the software package coancestry implements seven relatedness estimators and three inbreeding estimators to estimate relatedness and inbreeding coefficients from multilocus genotype data. two likelihood estimators that allow for inbred individuals and account for genotyping errors are for the first time included in this user‐friendly program for pcs running windows operating system. a simulation module is built in the program to simulate multilocus genotype data of individuals with a predefined relationship, and to compare the estimators and the simulated relatedness values to facilitate the selection of the best estimator in a particular situation. bootstrapping and permutations are used to obtain the 95% confidence intervals of each relatedness or inbreeding estimate, and to test the difference in averages between groups.
automatic generation of test inputs for mercury we introduce mercury, a new purely declarative logic programming language designed to provide the support that groups of application programmers need when building large programs. mercury's strong type, mode, and determinism systems improve program reliability by catching many errors at compile time. we present a new and relatively simple execution model that takes advantage of the information these systems provide, yielding very efficient code. the mercury compiler uses this execution model to generate portable c code. our benchmarking shows that the code generated by our implementation is significantly faster than the code generated by mature optimizing implementations of other logic programming languages.
d-hotm: distributed higher order text mining few tools exist that address the challenges facing researchers in the textual data mining (tdm) field. some are too specific to their application, or are prototypes not suitable for general use. more general tools often are not capable of processing large volumes of data. we have created a textual data mining infrastructure (tmi) that incorporates both existing and new capabilities in a reusable framework conducive to developing new tools and components. tmi adheres to strict guidelines that allow it to run in a wide range of processing environments – as a result, it accommodates the volume of computing and diversity of research occurring in tdm. a unique capability of tmi is support for optimization. this facilitates text mining research by automating the search for optimal parameters in text mining algorithms. in this article we describe a number of applications that use the tmi. a brief tutorial is provided on the use of tmi. we present several novel results that have not been published elsewhere. we also discuss how the tmi utilizes existing machine-learning libraries, thereby enabling researchers to continue and extend their endeavors with minimal effort. towards that end, tmi is available on the web at .
bay41-6551 achieves bactericidal tracheal aspirate amikacin concentrations in mechanically ventilated patients with gram-negative pneumonia appropriate end points are crucial for the successful interpretation of clinical trials. choosing end points for therapeutic trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) requires careful consideration, because they are complications of critical illness. it may be difficult to distinguish the consequences of vap and hap from manifestations of the underlying illnesses, and it is important to determine their incremental magnitude, to plan for possible treatment effects and, thus, sample size calculations. in this article, we discuss mortality, attributable mortality, and time to clinical events as possible end points for hap and/or vap trials. because of the paucity of evidence on hap, we focus predominantly on vap. in a systematic review of applicable trials, vap appears to have slight intensive care unit and low hospital-attributable mortality. vap is associated with prolonged durations of intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. because of these findings, superiority trials of vap treatment that use mortality as a primary end point are not possible. equivalency studies are possible, but there are sample size implications. the use of time to clinical event end points, especially when combined with mortality, may be the best option for trial in the future.
incremental local gaussian regression novel applications in unstructured and non-stationary human environments require robots that learn from experience and adapt autonomously to changing conditions. predictive models therefore not only need to be accurate, but should also be updated incrementally in real-time and require minimal human intervention. incremental sparse spectrum gaussian process regression is an algorithm that is targeted specifically for use in this context. rather than developing a novel algorithm from the ground up, the method is based on the thoroughly studied gaussian process regression algorithm, therefore ensuring a solid theoretical foundation. non-linearity and a bounded update complexity are achieved simultaneously by means of a finite dimensional random feature mapping that approximates a kernel function. as a result, the computational cost for each update remains constant over time. finally, algorithmic simplicity and support for automated hyperparameter optimization ensures convenience when employed in practice. empirical validation on a number of synthetic and real-life learning problems confirms that the performance of incremental sparse spectrum gaussian process regression is superior with respect to the popular locally weighted projection regression, while computational requirements are found to be significantly lower. the method is therefore particularly suited for learning with real-time constraints or when computational resources are limited.
impaired nav1.2 function and reduced cell surface expression in benign familial neonatal‐infantile seizures summary:  purpose: mutations in scn1a, encoding the human nav1.1 neuronal voltage‐gated sodium channel, cause the syndrome of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (smei). most smei‐associated mutations are predicted to truncate the scn1a protein, likely causing a loss of sodium channel function. however, many missense or in‐frame deletion scn1a mutations have also been reported in this disorder, but their functional impact is largely unknown. here we report the functional characterization of eight scn1a mutations (g177e, i227s, r393h, y426n, h939q, c959r, delf1289, and t1909i) previously identified in smei probands.
recovering missing labels of crowdsourcing workers we consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. a principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. we present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.
gene expression profiling of upregulated mrnas in granulosa cells of bovine ovulatory follicles following stimulation with hcg abstract molecular determinants and mechanisms involved in ovarian follicular growth, ovulation, and luteinization are not well understood. the objective of this study was to identify genes expressed in bovine granulosa cells (gc) of dominant follicles (df) and downregulated after hcg-induced ovulation, using the suppression subtractive hybridization (ssh). gc were collected from df at day 5 of the estrous cycle and from ovulatory follicles (of) obtained 23 h following injection of hcg. a subtracted cdna library (df-of) was generated and screened using unsubtracted (df, of) and subtracted (df-of, of-df) cdnas as complex 32p-probes. a total of 32 nonredundant cdnas were identified: 23 cdnas matched with sequences of known biological function and 9 cdnas with complete or partial sequences of undefined biological function. detection of genes known to be downregulated during the periovulatory period in the bovine species, such as cpd, cyp11a1, cyp19a1, fshr, lrp8/ apoer2, and serpine2, validated the physiological model and analytical techniques used. for a subset of genes, such as arfgap3, cyp11a1, cyp19a1, fshr, fst, gja1, idh3, inhba, lhcgr, lhcgr lacking exon 10, prc1, prg1, rpa2, scd, and trib2, gene expression profiles were compared by virtual northern blot or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from follicles obtained at different developmental stages. results confirmed a downregulation of the respective mrnas in gc of of compared with that of df. we conclude that we have identified novel genes that are downregulated by hcg in bovine gc of df during the periovulatory period, which may contribute to follicular growth, ovulation, and/or luteinization.
fish pollutants mehg and aroclor cause permanent structural damage in male gonads and kidneys after prepubertal exposure we determined the effects of low-level prenatal mehg exposure on neuronal migration in the developing rat cerebral cortex using in utero electroporation. we used offspring rats born to dams that had been exposed to saline or various doses of mehg (0.01 mg/kg/day, 0.1 mg/kg/day, and 1 mg/kg/day) from gestational day (gd) 11-21. immunohistochemical examination of the brains of the offspring was conducted on postnatal day (pnd) 0, pnd3, and pnd7. our results showed that prenatal exposure to low levels of mehg (0.1 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg/day) during the critical stage in neuronal migration resulted in migration defects of the cerebrocortical neurons in offspring rats. importantly, our data revealed that the abnormal neuronal distribution induced by mehg was not caused by altered proliferation of neural progenitor cells (npcs), induction of apoptosis of npcs and/or newborn neurons, abnormal differentiation of npcs, and the morphological changes of radial glial scaffold, indicating that the defective neuronal positioning triggered by exposure to low-dose of mehg is due to the impacts of mehg on the process of neuronal migration itself. moreover, we demonstrated that in utero exposure to low-level mehg suppresses the expression of rac1, cdc42, and rhoa, which play key roles in the migration of cerebrocortical neurons during the early stage of brain development, suggesting that the mehg-induced migratory disturbance of cerebrocortical neurons is likely associated with the rho gtpases signal pathway. in conclusion, our results provide a novel perspective on clarifying the mechanisms underlying the impairment of neuronal migration induced by mehg.
joint estimation of motion, structure and geometry from stereo sequences from the publisher:  with contributions from theo papadopoulo      over the last forty years, researchers have made great strides in elucidating the laws of image formation, processing, and understanding by animals, humans, and machines. this book describes the state of knowledge in one subarea of vision, the geometric laws that relate different views of a scene. geometry, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, is the natural language for describing three-dimensional shapes and spatial relations. projective geometry, the geometry that best models image formation, provides a unified framework for thinking about many geometric problems relevant to vision. the book formalizes and analyzes the relations between multiple views of a scene from the perspective of various types of geometries. a key feature is that it considers euclidean and affine geometries as special cases of projective geometry.  images play a prominent role in computer communications. producers and users of images, in particular three-dimensional images, require a framework for stating and solving problems. the book offers a number of conceptual tools and theoretical results useful for the design of machine vision algorithms. it also illustrates these tools and results with many examples of real applications.
asfalt: a simple fault-tolerant signature-based localization technique for emergency sensor networks wireless sensor networks have gained considerable attention in the past few years. they have found application domains in battlefield communication, homeland security, pollution sensing, and traffic monitoring. as such, there has been an increasing need to define and develop simulation frameworks for carrying out high-fidelity wsn simulation. in this article we present a modeling, simulation, and emulation framework for wsns in j-sim - an open source, component-based compositional network simulation environment developed entirely in java. this framework is built on the autonomous component architecture and extensible internetworking framework of j-sim, and provides an object-oriented definition of target, sensor, and sink nodes, sensor and wireless communication channels, and physical media such as seismic channels, mobility models, and power models (both energy-producing and energy-consuming components). application-specific models can be defined by subclassing classes in the simulation framework and customizing their behaviors. we also include in j-sim a set of classes and mechanisms to realize network emulation. we demonstrate the use of the proposed wsn simulation framework by implementing several well-known localization, geographic routing, and directed diffusion protocols, and perform performance comparisons (in terms of the execution time incurred and memory used) in simulating wsn scenarios in j-sim and ns-2. the simulation study indicates the wsn framework in j-sim is much more scalable than ns-2 (especially in memory usage). we also demonstrate the use of the wsn framework in carrying out real-life full-fledged future combat system (fcs) simulation and emulation
dago-fun: tool for gene ontology-based functional analysis using term information content measures backgroundsemantic similarity measures are useful to assess the physiological relevance of protein-protein interactions (ppis). they quantify similarity between proteins based on their function using annotation systems like the gene ontology (go). proteins that interact in the cell are likely to be in similar locations or involved in similar biological processes compared to proteins that do not interact. thus the more semantically similar the gene function annotations are among the interacting proteins, more likely the interaction is physiologically relevant. however, most semantic similarity measures used for ppi confidence assessment do not consider the unequal depth of term hierarchies in different classes of cellular location, molecular function, and biological process ontologies of go and thus may over-or under-estimate similarity.resultswe describe an improved algorithm, topological clustering semantic similarity (tcss), to compute semantic similarity between go terms annotated to proteins in interaction datasets. our algorithm, considers unequal depth of biological knowledge representation in different branches of the go graph. the central idea is to divide the go graph into sub-graphs and score ppis higher if participating proteins belong to the same sub-graph as compared to if they belong to different sub-graphs.conclusionsthe tcss algorithm performs better than other semantic similarity measurement techniques that we evaluated in terms of their performance on distinguishing true from false protein interactions, and correlation with gene expression and protein families. we show an average improvement of 4.6 times the f1 score over resnik, the next best method, on our saccharomyces cerevisiae ppi dataset and 2 times on our homo sapiens ppi dataset using cellular component, biological process and molecular function go annotations.
effects of intranasal insulin on hepatic fat accumulation and energy metabolism in humans a theoretical triglyceride model was developed for in vivo human liver fat 1h mrs characterization, using the number of double bonds (chch), number of methylene‐interrupted double bonds (chchch2chch) and average fatty acid chain length. five 3 t, single‐voxel, stimulated echo acquisition mode spectra (steam) were acquired consecutively at progressively longer tes in a fat–water emulsion phantom and in 121 human subjects with known or suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. t2‐corrected peak areas were calculated. phantom data were used to validate the model. human data were used in the model to determine the complete liver fat spectrum. in the fat–water emulsion phantom, the spectrum predicted by the model (based on known fatty acid chain distribution) agreed closely with spectroscopic measurement. in human subjects, areas of ch2 peaks at 2.1 and 1.3 ppm were linearly correlated (slope, 0.172; r = 0.991), as were the 0.9 ppm ch3 and 1.3 ppm ch2 peaks (slope, 0.125; r = 0.989). the 2.75 ppm ch2 peak represented 0.6% of the total fat signal in high‐liver‐fat subjects. these values predict that 8.6% of the total fat signal overlies the water peak. the triglyceride model can characterize human liver fat spectra. this allows more accurate determination of liver fat fraction from mri and mrs. copyright © 2010 john wiley & sons, ltd.
is college education an equalizer for social disparities in health literacy? a case study in shanghai, china previous contributions to this series of editorials and otherrecent papers have highlighted the growth in interest inhealth literacy, as well as continuing debate about its def-inition, measurement and importance (kickbusch 2009;wills 2009; abel 2008; nutbeam 2008; coulter and ellins2007). in further advancing these debates there is much tobe gained from an appraisal of the underlying concept ofliteracy.literacy is an important but complex concept. generallyit is acknowledged as having two distinctive elements:those that are task-based, and those that are skill-based(national assessment of adult literacy 2003). task-basedliteracy focuses on the extent to which a person can per-form key literacy tasks such as read a basic text and write asimple statement. skill-based literacy focuses on theknowledge and skills an adult must possess in order toperform these tasks. these skills range from basic, word-level skills (such as recognising words) to higher levelskills (such as drawing appropriate inferences from con-tinuous text).it follows that literacy can be measured in absoluteterms by distinguishing between those who can read andwrite basic text and those who cannot, and in relative termsby assessing the skill differences between adults who areable to perform relatively challenging literacy tasks andthose who are not.the reason why we care so much about literacy is thateven the most basic functional literacy skills enable peopleto better develop their knowledge and improve the poten-tial to achieve personal goals, and through this toparticipate more fully in society, both economically andsocially. given this background, it is not surprising to ﬁndthat literacy levels in a population are associated bothdirectly and indirectly with a range of health outcomes.low literacy is often linked to poor socio-economic cir-cumstances, and in turn with adverse effects on health thatare independent of other risk factors (jahan 2008). this isespecially the case in the relationship between female lit-eracy and maternal and child health outcomes (schell et al.2007). people with poor literacy tend to be less responsiveto health education, less likely to use disease preventionservices, and to successfully manage chronic disease(dewalt et al. 2004).responding to low levels of literacy in a populationinvolves improving access to effective school education,and providing adult literacy programs for those in need.achieving high levels of literacy in a population is not onlya vital development goal, but will also produce substantialpublic health beneﬁts.to better understand health literacy as a distinct concept,it is helpful to delve into current discourse on different‘‘literacies’’, recognising that literacy is both content andcontext speciﬁc. this is especially the case in relation to‘‘new literacies’’ emerging in response to new informationtechnologies (coiro 2003), and context-speciﬁc literaciessuch as media literacy and ﬁnancial literacy (primack andhobbs 2009; kozup and hogarth 2008). this furtherreﬁnement in the concept reﬂects the fact that individuals
sample size estimation for power and accuracy in the experimental comparison of algorithms researchers often calculate ratios of measured quantities. specifying confidence limits for ratios is difficult and the appropriate methods are often unknown. appropriate methods are described (fieller, taylor, special bootstrap methods). for the fieller method a simple geometrical interpretation is given. monte carlo simulations show when these methods are appropriate and that the most frequently used methods (index method and zero-variance method) can lead to large liberal deviations from the desired confidence level. it is discussed when we can use standard regression or measurement error models and when we have to resort to specific models for heteroscedastic data. finally, an old warning is repeated that we should be aware of the problems of spurious correlations if we use ratios.
a noise-adaptive method for detection of brief episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation a novel method for qrst cancellation during atrial fibrillation (af) is introduced for use in recordings with two or more leads. the method is based on an echo state neural network which estimates the time-varying, nonlinear transfer function between two leads, one lead with atrial activity and another lead without, for the purpose of canceling ventricular activity. the network has different sets of weights that define the input, hidden, and output layers, of which only the output set is adapted for every new sample to be processed. the performance is evaluated on ecg signals, with simulated f-waves added, by determining the root mean square error between the true f-wave signal and the estimated signal, as well as by evaluating the dominant af frequency. when compared to average beat subtraction (abs), being the most widely used method for qrst cancellation, the performance is found to be significantly better with an error reduction factor of 0.24-0.43, depending on f-wave amplitude. the estimates of dominant af frequency are considerably more accurate for all f-wave amplitudes than the af estimates based on abs. the novel method is particularly well suited for implementation in mobile health systems where monitoring of af during extended time periods is of interest.

brain metastasis in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the real world: a single-institution, retrospective review of 12-year follow-up purpose to update the american society of clinical oncology (asco)/college of american pathologists (cap) guideline recommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) testing in breast cancer to improve the accuracy of her2 testing and its utility as a predictive marker in invasive breast cancer.   methods asco/cap convened an update committee that included coauthors of the 2007 guideline to conduct a systematic literature review and update recommendations for optimal her2 testing.   results the update committee identified criteria and areas requiring clarification to improve the accuracy of her2 testing by immunohistochemistry (ihc) or in situ hybridization (ish). the guideline was reviewed and approved by both organizations.   recommendations the update committee recommends that her2 status (her2 negative or positive) be determined in all patients with invasive (early stage or recurrence) breast cancer on the basis of one or more her2 test results (negative, equivocal, or positive). testing criteria define her2-positive status when (on observing within an area of tumor that amounts to >10% of contiguous and homogeneous tumor cells) there is evidence of protein overexpression (ihc) or gene amplification (her2 copy number or her2/cep17 ratio by ish based on counting at least 20 cells within the area). if results are equivocal (revised criteria), reflex testing should be performed using an alternative assay (ihc or ish). repeat testing should be considered if results seem discordant with other histopathologic findings. laboratories should demonstrate high concordance with a validated her2 test on a sufficiently large and representative set of specimens. testing must be performed in a laboratory accredited by cap or another accrediting entity. the update committee urges providers and health systems to cooperate to ensure the highest quality testing.
low complexity lattice reduction aided mmse precoding design for mimo systems we investigate the use of multi-antennas at both ends of a point-to-point communication system over the additive gaussian channel. we consider a system with t transmit antennas and r receive antennas in which the received vector v/spl isin/c/sup /spl tau// depends on the transmitted vector u/spl isin/c/sup /spl tau// via: v=hu+w where h/spl isin/c/sup r/spl times/t/ is the channel transfer matrix and w is zero-mean complex circular symmetric gaussian noise. we assume that e[ww]=/spl sigma//sup 2/i/sub r/. the transmitter is constrained in its total power, i.e., e[uu]/spl les/e/sub s/. we assume that the channel matrix h is known at both ends of the communication system, and that the waveform channel is flat over the bandwidth of interest.
possible roles of zic1 and zic4, identified within the medaka double anal fin (da) locus, in dorsoventral patterning of the trunk-tail region (related to phenotypes of the da mutant) abstract. during vertebrate neural tube formation, the initially lateral borders between the neural and epidermal ectoderm fuse to form the definitive dorsal region of the embryo, while the initially dorsally located notochord-floor plate complex is being internalised. along the definitive dorso-ventral body axis, one can distinguish an epaxial (dorsal to the notochord) and a hypaxial (ventral to the notochord) body region. the mesodermal somites on both sides of the notochord and neural tube give rise to the trunk skeleton and skeletal muscle. muscle forms from the somite-derived dermomyotomes and myotomes that elongate dorsally and ventrally. based on gene expression patterns and comparative embryology, it is proposed here that the epaxial (dermo)myotome region in amniote embryos is subdivided into a dorsalmost and a centrally intercalated subregion. the intercalated subregion abuts to the hypaxial (dermo)myotome region that elongates ventrally via the hypaxial somitic bud. the dorsalmost subregion elongates towards the dorsal neural tube and is proposed to derive from an epaxial somitic bud. the dorsalmost and hypaxial somite derivatives share specific gene expression patterns which are distinct from those of the intercalated somite derivatives. the intercalated somite derivatives develop adaxially, i.e. at the level of the notochord-floor plate complex. thus, the dorsalmost and intercalated (dermo)myotome subregions may be influenced preferentially by signals from the dorsal neural tube and from the notochord-floor plate complex, respectively. these (dermo)myotome subregions are sharply delimited from each other by molecular boundary markers, including engrailed and wnts. it thus appears that the molecular network that polarises borders in drosophila and vertebrate embryogenesis is redeployed during subregionalisation of the (dermo)myotome. it is proposed here that cells within the amniote (dermo)myotome establish polarised borders with organising capacity, and that the epaxial somitic bud represents a mirror-image duplication of the hypaxial somitic bud along such a border. the resulting epaxial-intercalated/adaxial-hypaxial regionalisation of somite derivatives is conserved in vertebrates although the differentiation of sclerotome and myotome starts heterochronically in embryos of different vertebrate groups.
macular pigment density at the site of altered fundus autofluorescence abstract  background. there is growing evidence that the development of age-related macular degeneration (amd) is related to oxidative damage. this makes macular pigment (mp) an interesting target for research, as antioxidative quality is related to mp. as studies have shown that mp density (mpd) can be increased by dietary supplementation, mp may also offer a therapeutic or preventive approach to amd.  methods. using scanning laser techniques, we quantified mpd in healthy subjects and patients with dry amd. we introduce a modified scanning laser ophthalmoscope (slo) which includes several advantages for the use in the clinical routine compared to the standard slo.  results. we examined 10 healthy subjects without ocular pathology and 10 patients with dry amd (geographic atrophy). eyes of patients with amd had a significantly lower mpd (mean value 0.094±0.022 density units, du) than healthy eyes (mean value 0.184±0.023 du).  conclusions. it is possible to quantify mpd using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope in a clinical setting. the modified slo offers several improvements with regard to the special requirements of the clinical situation. using the new instrument, we were able to detect differences in mpd between patients with dry amd and young healthy subjects. further studies are needed to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the method.
evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis. progressive tissue fibrosis can compromise epithelial function resulting in organ failure. appreciating evidence suggests that fibroblasts provide fibrogenic collagens during such injury. we further tested this notion by attempting to reduce the physiologic consequences of organ fibrosis through the selective killing of fibroblasts at sites of injury. here, we report the conditional reduction of tissue fibroblasts using the coding sequence for herpesvirus thymidine kinase (deltatk) put under the control of a cell-specific promoter from the gene encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). transgenic fibroblasts from mice carrying fsp1.deltatk minigenes expressed thymidine kinase concordantly with native fsp1 and, compared to transgenic epithelium, were selectively susceptible to the lethal effects of nucleoside analogs either in culture or during experimental renal fibrosis. the numbers of fibroblasts in fibrogenic kidney tissue were reduced on exposure to nucleoside analogs as was the degree of type i collagen deposition and the extent of fibrosis. fibroblast reduction following the stress of dna chain termination highlights the important contribution of cell division during fibrogenesis. our findings convey a proof of principle regarding the importance of fsp1(+) fibroblasts in fibrosis as well as providing a new approach to treating the relentless scarification of tissue.
predicting peer-review participation at large scale using an ensemble learning method algorithms for feature selection fall into two broad categories: wrappers that use the learning algorithm itself to evaluate the usefulness of features and filters that evaluate features according to heuristics based on general characteristics of the data. for application to large databases, filters have proven to be more practical than wrappers because they are much faster. however, most existing filter algorithms only work with discrete classification problems. this paper describes a fast, correlation-based filter algorithm that can be applied to continuous and discrete problems. the algorithm often outperforms the well-known relieff attribute estimator when used as a preprocessing step for naive bayes, instance-based learning, decision trees, locally weighted regression, and model trees. it performs more feature selection than relieff does—reducing the data dimensionality by fifty percent in most cases. also, decision and model trees built from the preprocessed data are often significantly smaller.
host specificity and reproductive success of yucca moths (tegeticula spp. lepidoptera: prodoxidae) mirror patterns of gene flow between host plant varieties of the joshua tree (yucca brevifolia: agavaceae) dominant markers such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (aflps) provide an economical way of surveying variation at many loci. however, the uncertainty about the underlying genotypes presents a problem for statistical analysis. similarly, the presence of null alleles and the limitations of genotype calling in polyploids mean that many conventional analysis methods are invalid for many organisms. here we present a simple approach for accounting for genotypic ambiguity in studies of population structure and apply it to aflp data from whitefish. the approach is implemented in the program structure version 2.2, which is available from http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html.
the isometric functional capacity of muscles that cross the elbow. in muscle force analysis, orientations and moment arms of the muscles about a joint provide essential coefficients in the equilibrium equations. for the determination of these parameters, several experimental techniques, including geometric measurement, tendon-joint displacement measurement and direct load measurement, are available. advantages and disadvantages associated with each of the techniques are reviewed and compared based on our extensive experience.
prediction of complications in a high-risk cohort of patients undergoing corrective arthrodesis of late stage charcot deformity based on the pedis score background: charcot foot arthropathy negatively impacts the health-related quality of life (hrql) of affected individuals. the disease process often is responsible for the development of significant deformity and disability, often progressing to lower extremity amputation. many patients are morbidly obese, immunocompromised, and have complex wounds with underlying bony infection or poor bone quality, making operative correction and internal fixation problematic. methods: using a prospective clinical algorithm, 26 consecutive diabetic adults with multiple diabetic co-morbidities, including morbid obesity, had operative correction of nonplantigrade charcot midfoot deformity at the midfoot level. correction was maintained with a neutrally applied three-level ring external fixator. average body mass index was 38.31 ± 12.51. nineteen patients used insulin. fourteen had open wounds with underlying osteomyelitis. the altered relationship between the forefoot and hindfoot was measured as 14.04 ± 31.09 degrees in the anteroposterior axis, and 16.70 ± 17.47 degrees in the lateral axis before surgery. surgery included achilles tendon lengthening, excision of infected bone, correction of the multiplanar deformity, and culture-specific parenteral antibiotic therapy. results: at a minimum 1-year followup, 24 of 26 patients were ulcer and infection free and able to ambulate with commercially-available depth-inlay shoes and custom accommodative foot orthoses. one patient died of unrelated causes, and one had transtibial amputation for persistent infection. four developed recurrent plantar ulcers, which resolved with excision of underlying bony prominences. there were two stress fractures through olive wire pin sites, one requiring intramedullary nailing. the radiographic anteroposterior axis was corrected to 3.12 ± 9.42 degrees, and lateral to 10.42 ± 11.86 degrees after surgery. conclusions: morbidly obese diabetic individuals with multiple co-morbidities complicating severe charcot foot deformity can achieve correction of midfoot deformity after operative correction of the deformity and maintenance of that correction with a neutrally applied ring external fixator.
attention biases to threat link behavioral inhibition to social withdrawal over time in very young children objective to examine attention bias toward threat faces in a large sample of anxiety-disordered youths using a well-established visual probe task.   method study participants included 101 children and adolescents (ages 7-18 years) with generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety disorder enrolled in a multisite anxiety treatment study. nonanxious youths (n = 51; ages 9-18 years) were recruited separately. participants were administered a computerized visual probe task that presents pairs of faces portraying threat (angry), positive (happy), and neutral expressions. they pressed a response key to indicate the spatial location of a probe that replaced one of the faces on each trial. attention bias scores were calculated from response times to probes for each emotional face type.   results compared to healthy youths, anxious participants demonstrated a greater attention bias toward threat faces. this threat bias in anxious patients did not significantly vary across the anxiety disorders. there was no group difference in attention bias toward happy faces.   conclusions these results suggest that pediatric anxiety disorders are associated with an attention bias toward threat. future research may examine the manner in which cognitive bias in anxious youths changes with treatment.
the xylanase inhibitor taxi-iii counteracts the necrotic activity of a fusarium graminearum xylanase in vitro and in durum wheat transgenic plants. a simple histo-cytochemical method, combining evans blue staining to assess cell death and in vivo 3,3′-diaminobenzidine uptake for h2o2 localisation, has been used to evaluate o3 damages in leaf tissues of three phaseolus vulgaris l. cultivars (cannellino, blf, saxa) with different sensitivity to the pollutant. bean plants were exposed to a single pulse of o3 (150 ± 10 mm3 m−3 × 3 h) and leaves were examined at different time-span after fumigation. cannellino proved to be the most sensitive, showing chlorotic spots 2 h after fumigation and chlorotic lesions 24 h later. in blf, necrotic spots appeared 4 h after fumigation and reddish necrotic lesions (bronzing) developed in further 24 h. saxa remained symptomless up to 10 d of observation, thus appearing tolerant. the early appearance of symptoms in cannellino correlated with h2o2 accumulation in leaf tissues and consequent extensive cell death, involving both palisade and spongy mesophyll. h2o2 accumulation was observed also in blf, though to a lesser extent and dead cells were rare at 2 h after fumigation. however, they increased in number 24 h later, forming small groups in the palisade mesophyll. these groups further enlarged in the next 24 h, again involving only palisade mesophyll. in saxa leaves, h2o2 accumulation was found only in the epidermal cells, though the number of dead cells was very similar to blf, at least up to 24 h after fumigation. however, in saxa, dead cells have been always found singly scattered through the palisade mesophyll, or forming very small groups around substomatal cavity, thus remaining invisible at a macroscopic level.
feature subset selection based on bio-inspired algorithms the simple bayesian classifier is known to be optimal when attributes are independent given the class, but the question of whether other sufficient conditions for its optimality exist has so far not been explored. empirical results showing that it performs surprisingly well in many domains containing clear attribute dependences suggest that the answer to this question may be positive. this article shows that, although the bayesian classifier's probability estimates are only optimal under quadratic loss if the independence assumption holds, the classifier itself can be optimal under zero-one loss (misclassification rate) even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. the region of quadratic-loss optimality of the bayesian classifier is in fact a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the region of zero-one optimality. this implies that the bayesian classifier has a much greater range of applicability than previously thought. for example, in this article it is shown to be optimal for learning conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. further, studies in artificial domains show that it will often outperform more powerful classifiers for common training set sizes and numbers of attributes, even if its bias is a priori much less appropriate to the domain. this article's results also imply that detecting attribute dependence is not necessarily the best way to extend the bayesian classifier, and this is also verified empirically.
in vivo tnf-α inhibition ameliorates cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in experimental heart failure time for primary review 29 days.   congestive heart failure (chf) is a common clinical problem that confronts physicians and is often the final manifestation of many cardiovascular disorders. the diagnosis of chf is accompanied by significant mortality and morbidity [1]. the syndrome is characterized by a relentless progressive course that is often manifested as repeated hospital admissions imposing heavy economic burden on the health care delivery system [2,3]. therefore, basic research into the fundamental mechanisms accounting for the progression of chf with the hope for developing novel therapeutic approaches to alter the progressive course has become a priority for many researchers. to facilitate these investigations, an animal model that closely mimics human chf and also exhibits key components of what are now perceived to be important pathogenetic contributors to chf progression is ideal. it is therefore the objective of this review to highlight how the model of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy has provided insights into the mechanisms of progression of chf.  clinicians have traditionally viewed chf as being predominantly a haemodynamic disorder. accordingly, haemodynamic descriptors such as elevated cardiac filling pressures, pulmonary venous and arterial hypertension, reduced cardiac output, and elevated systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance were used to characterize patients with chf. while the haemodynamic descriptors can account for some of the clinical manifestations of chf, such as dyspnea, fatigue and fluid retention, they do not adequately address the invariably progressive nature of the condition. in recent years, it has become apparent that chf is a syndrome associated with a complex array of perturbations at multiple levels starting from the subcellular to the whole organ level. these alterations include profound structural and functional changes, which may culminate in the death of myocytes as well as major disruption of the cardiac extracellular matrix [4]. both of these processes may …   * corresponding author.
developing practice and staff: enabling improvement in care delivery through participatory action research background lecturer practitioner roles are well established in the united kingdom. the national literature demonstrates that these staff are valuable to national health service trusts and universities however, their roles are busy and demanding, with conflicting expectations from the two employers. in addition, their role in addressing the theory-practice gap - a major reason for their establishment - is at best unclear. although a number of qualitative studies have explored the topic, there have been no systematic attempts to develop the role or to quantify the effects on postholders.   aim this paper reports a study that aimed to develop aspects of lecturer practitioners' work roles, examine the effects of this on individuals at one english university, and to quantify lecturer practitioners' occupational stress and burnout.   methods a flexible, 'spiral' action research framework and 'collaborative group approach' were used, with mixed methods of data collection. data were collected through focus groups, meetings and participant feedback, and participants' reflective diaries. a questionnaire using previously validated psychological attitude rating scales was also used to measure occupational stress and burnout, the extent to which the project influenced these, and the influence of lecturer practitioners' experience and qualifications. six null hypotheses were constructed to measure these ideas. findings from qualitative and quantitative perspectives were triangulated to give depth to the analysis.   findings five themes emerged from the focus groups: personal motivation, workload pressures, role clarity, preparation and support, and gains from the role. specific policies and documentation were developed as a result of this initial project planning work. the findings from the questionnaire indicated that lecturer practitioners were no more stressed or burnt out than comparable workers. synthesis of findings indicated, broadly speaking, that these lps were 'thriving rather than just surviving'.   conclusion action research was an effective methodology for uncovering new knowledge, and bringing about organizational change in this project.
muscle injury in rats induces upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in injured muscle and calcitonin gene–related peptide in dorsal root ganglia innervating the injured muscle analysis of locomotion is an important tool in the study of peripheral and central nervous system damage. most locomotor scoring systems in rodents are based either upon open field locomotion assessment, for example, the bbb score or upon foot print analysis. the former yields a semiquantitative description of locomotion as a whole, whereas the latter generates quantitative data on several selected gait parameters. in this paper, we describe the use of a newly developed gait analysis method that allows easy quantitation of a large number of locomotion parameters during walkway crossing. we were able to extract data on interlimb coordination, swing duration, paw print areas (total over stance, and at 20-msec time resolution), stride length, and base of support: similar data can not be gathered by any single previously described method. we compare changes in gait parameters induced by two different models of spinal cord injury in rats, transection of the dorsal half of the spinal cord and spinal cord contusion injury induced by the nyu or mascis device. although we applied this method to rats with spinal cord injury, the usefulness of this method is not limited to rats or to the investigation of spinal cord injuries alone.
autosomal dominant macular degeneration associated with 208delg mutation in the fscn2 gene. the full-field electroretinogram (erg) is a widely used ocular electrophysiological test and we believe that a basic protocol should be standardized so that certain responses will be recorded comparably throughout the world. we propose that parameters be developed for five commonly obtained responses: 1. a response developed by the rods (in the dark-adapted eye) 2. a maximal response in the dark-adapted eye 3. oscillatory potentials 4. a response developed by the cones 5. responses obtained to a rapidly repeated stimulus (flicker) while this document is intended as a guide to practice, and will assist in interpretation of ergs, we recognize that there are many additional techniques and protocols which certain laboratories may choose to employ. the standard describes simple technical procedures that allow reproducible ergs to be recorded under a few defined conditions. different procedures can provide equivalent erg responses. it is incumbent upon users of alternative techniques to demonstrate that their procedures do in fact produce signals that are equivalent in basic waveform, amplitude, and physiological significance to the standard. our intention is that the standard methodology and responses be used widely, but not to the exclusion of other responses or additional tests that individual laboratories may choose or continue to employ. we also recognize that the investigation of certain eye conditions may not require all five of the standard responses. in addition, specialized types of electroretinography (e.g. focal electroretinography, early receptor potential,

acute resistance exercise does not change the hormonal response to sublingual androstenediol intake the effects of androgen precursors, combined with herbal extracts designed to enhance testosterone formation and reduce conversion of androgens to estrogens was studied in young men. subjects performed 3 days of resistance training per week for 8 weeks. each day during weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, subjects consumed either placebo (pl; n = 10) or a supplement (andro-6; n = 10), which contained daily doses of 300 mg androstenedione, 150 mg dhea, 750 mg tribulus terrestris, 625 mg chrysin, 300 mg indole-3-carbinol, and 540 mg saw palmetto. serum androstenedione concentrations were higher in andro-6 after 2, 5, and 8 weeks (p <.05), while serum concentrations of free and total testosterone were unchanged in both groups. serum estradiol was elevated at weeks 2, 5, and 8 in andro-6 (p <.05), and serum estrone was elevated at weeks 5 and 8 (p <.05). muscle strength increased (p <.05) similarly from weeks 0 to 4, and again from weeks 4 to 8 in both treatment groups. the acute effect of one third of the daily dose of andro-6 and pl was studied in 10 men (23 +/- 4 years). serum androstenedione concentrations were elevated (p <.05) in andro-6 from 150 to 360 min after ingestion, while serum free or total testosterone concentrations were unchanged. these data provide evidence that the addition of these herbal extracts to androstenedione does not result in increased serum testosterone concentrations, reduce the estrogenic effect of androstenedione, and does not augment the adaptations to resistance training.
bassline pitch prediction for real-time performance systems in this paper we present a model for beat-synchronous analysis of musical audio signals. introducing a real-time beat tracking model with performance comparable to offline techniques, we discuss its application to the analysis of musical performances segmented by beat. we discuss the various design choices for beat-synchronous analysis and their implications for real-time implementations before presenting some beat-synchronous harmonic analysis examples. we make available our beat tracker and beatsynchronous analysis techniques as externals for max/msp.
retrieving the vertical distribution of stratospheric oclo from odin/osiris limb-scattered sunlight measurements [1] vertical profiles of nitrogen dioxide in the 19–40 km altitude range are successfully retrieved over the globe from optical spectrograph and infrared imager system (osiris) limb scatter observations in late 2001 and early 2002. the inclusion of multiple scattering in the radiative transfer model used in the inversion algorithm allows for the retrieval of no2 down to 19 km. the slant column densities, which represent the observations in the inversion, are obtained by fitting the fine structure in normalized radiance spectra over the 435–449 nm range, where no2 electronic absorption is readily observable because of long light paths through stratospheric layers rich in this constituent. details of the spectral fitting and inversion algorithm are discussed, including the discovery of a pseudo-absorber associated with pixelated detectors and a new method to verify altitude registration. comparisons are made with spatially and temporally coincident profile measurements of this photochemically active trace gas. better than 20% agreement is obtained with all correlative measurements over the common retrieval altitude range, confirming the validity of osiris no2 profiles. systematic biases in the number densities are not observed at any altitude. a ‘‘snapshot’’ meridional cross section between 40� n and 70� s is shown from observations during a fraction of an orbit. index terms: 0340 atmospheric composition and structure: middle atmosphere—composition and chemistry; 0360 atmospheric composition and structure: transmission and scattering of radiation; 0394 atmospheric composition and structure: instruments and techniques; 3334 meteorology and atmospheric dynamics: middle atmosphere dynamics (0341, 0342); keywords: optical, sun-synchronous, polar-orbiting, fraunhofer, ring effect, iterative onion peel
neural models of factuality we describe sutime, a temporal tagger for recognizing and normalizing temporal expressions in english text. sutime is available as part of the stanford corenlp pipeline and can be used to annotate documents with temporal information. it is a deterministic rule-based system designed for extensibility. testing on the tempeval-2 evaluation corpus shows that this system outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.
modeling the anti-masking effects of the olivocochlear reflex in auditory nerve responses to tones in sustained noise 1. the antimasking effects of olivocochlear (oc) efferent feedback were studied in anesthetized or decerebrate cats by comparing responses of single auditory-nerve fibers (anfs) to tone bursts in continuous masking noise seen with and without addition of a moderate-level contralateral noise known to activate the oc reflex. responses were measured as a function of tone-burst intensity, tone-burst frequency, and masker intensity and were analyzed so as to allow quantitative estimates of the detectability of the tone bursts against the noise background. 2. addition of the contralateral oc elicitor both increased the maximum discharge rates to the masked tone bursts and decreased the rates to the ipsilateral masker. the rate increases to the tone bursts could be explained on the basis of a decrease in adaptation caused by decreasing the steady response to the masker. the result is a steepening of the rate-versus-level function for masked tone bursts and a concomitant increase in the estimated discriminability of small increments of tone-burst intensity. 3. for tone bursts at the fiber's characteristic frequency (cf), the oc effects on detection threshold for the masked tone bursts depended on masker level, with small increases in threshold for low masker levels and somewhat larger decreases in threshold for higher masker levels. for tone bursts below cf, oc effects, when present, always decreased the detection threshold. 4. the largest antimasking effects were seen for fibers with cfs between 6 and 12 khz and for masker levels within 20 db of the fiber's threshold to the masker. these trends appeared to hold for fibers of all spontaneous rates (srs). 5. enhancement of the response to unmasked tone bursts and concomitant decrease in the "spontaneous rate" was elicited by oc activation in fibers if threshold sensitivity approached -10 db spl. this "enhancement-in-quiet" appears to arise when an animal-generated noise produces a continuous response (in the absence of purposely applied sound) that is suppressed by oc activity. this finding raises questions as to the range of "true" spontaneous rates in the cat. 6. the results highlight two important distinctions between the effects of oc feedback in quiet versus those in noise. in quiet, the effects are predominately suppressive and are restricted to stimuli at frequencies near a fiber's cf and at intensities within its dynamic range. in continuous background noise, the oc reflex can enhance the responses to transient stimuli. such effects are seen throughout the fiber's response area.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
the secret life of the anthrax agent bacillus anthracis: bacteriophage-mediated ecological adaptations phage-mediated lysis has been an essential laboratory tool for rapidly identifying bacillus anthracis for more than 40 years, relying on the gamma phage derivative of a bacillus cereus prophage called w. the complete genomic sequences of the temperate w phage, referred to as wbeta, and its lytic variant gamma were determined and found to encode 53 open reading frames each, spanning 40,864 bp and 37,373 bp, respectively. direct comparison of the genomes showed that gamma evolved through mutations at key loci controlling host recognition, lysogenic growth, and possibly host phenotypic modification. included are a cluster of point mutations at the gp14 tail fiber locus of gamma, encoding a protein that, when fused to green fluorescent protein, binds specifically to b. anthracis. a large 2,003-bp deletion was also identified at the gamma lysogeny module, explaining its shift from a temperate to a lytic lifestyle. finally, evidence of recombination was observed at a dicistronic wbeta locus, encoding putative bacterial cell surface-modifying proteins, replaced in gamma with a locus, likely obtained from a b. anthracis prophage, encoding demonstrable fosfomycin resistance. reverse transcriptase pcr analysis confirmed strong induction at the dicistronic wbeta locus and at four other phage loci in b. anthracis and/or b. cereus lysogens. in all, this study represents the first genomic and functional description of two historically important phages and is part of a broader investigation into contributions of phage to the b. anthracis life cycle. initial findings suggest that lysogeny of b. anthracis promotes ecological adaptation, rather than virulence, as with other gram-positive pathogens.
mitochondrial phylogeography of the bedriaga's rock lizard, archaeolacerta bedriagae (reptilia: lacertidae) endemic to corsica and sardinia. pleistocene climatic oscillations were a major force shaping genetic variability in many taxa. we analyse the relative effects of the ice ages across a latitudinal gradient in the western mediterranean region, testing two main predictions: (i) species with historical distributions in northern latitudes should have experienced greater loss of suitable habitat, resulting in higher extinction of historical lineages than species distributed in southern latitudes, where the effects of the ice ages were not as drastic. this would be reflected in the observation of lower diversity and number of differentiated lineages in northern areas. (ii) a signature of demographic expansion following the climate amelioration should be obvious in northern species, whereas in the south evidence of long‐term effective population size stability should be observed. we used as models three species of wall lizards (podarcis bocagei, podarcis carbonelli and podarcis vaucheri) that replace each other along the study area. we investigated the patterns of mitochondrial dna diversity and subdivision and obtained demographic parameter estimates for each species. our results suggest that p. bocagei, the northernmost species, bears low genetic diversity, a shallow coalescent history and marks of a demographic expansion. in contrast, p. vaucheri, the species with a southernmost distribution, shows deeper coalescence events, complex geographical substructure and no evidence for population growth. the species with an intermediate distribution, p. carbonelli, shows average levels of diversity, substructure and population growth. taken together, these results conform to our main predictions and are explained by a differential influence of the ice ages on distinct latitudes.
molecular cloning and sequencing of the f and 22 k membrane protein genes of the rss-2 strain of respiratory syncytial virus this paper describes a method of transferring fragments of dna from agarose gels to cellulose nitrate filters. the fragments can then be hybridized to radioactive rna and hybrids detected by radioautography or fluorography. the method is illustrated by analyses of restriction fragments complementary to ribosomal rnas from escherichia coli and xenopus laevis , and from several mammals.
does computer-assisted femur first thr improve musculoskeletal loading conditions? skeletal muscles transform neural control signals into forces that act upon the body segments to effect a coordinated motor task. this transformation is complex, not only because the properties of muscles are complex, but because the tendon affects the transmission of muscle force to the skeleton. this review focuses on how to synthesize basic properties of muscle and tendon to construct models applicable to studies of coordination. after a review of the properties of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length at rest. to illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.
the use of massive endoprostheses for the treatment of bone metastases the need for a standardized system of end result reporting of various surgical alternatives after limb salvaging and ablative procedures for musculoskeletal tumors was clearly recognized during the first international symposium on limb salvage (isols) in 1981. during the ensuing four biannual symposia, there has been an ongoing developmental experience with a system extensively field tested in 1989 by the musculoskeletal tumor society (msts). this system of functional evaluation has been adopted by the msts and isols for their joint studies and program presentation. in brief, the system assigns numerical values (0-5) for each of six categories: pain, and function and emotional acceptance in upper and lower extremities; supports, and walking and gait in the lower extremity; and hand positioning, and dexterity and lifting ability in the upper extremity. demographic information and a patient satisfaction component is included. a numerical score and percent rating is calculated to allow for comparison of results. the system has been field tested in 220 patients with low (+/-) interobserver variability. it was well accepted by the participants, and its usage is recommended by the msts to facilitate valid comparative end result studies of musculoskeletal tumor reconstructions.
neuronal detection thresholds during vestibular compensation: contributions of response variability and sensory substitution plasticity in neuronal responses is necessary for compensation following brain lesions and adaptation to new conditions and motor learning. in a previous study, we showed that compensatory changes in the vestibuloocular reflex (vor) following unilateral vestibular loss were characterized by dynamic reweighting of inputs from vestibular and extravestibular modalities at the level of single neurons that constitute the first central stage of vor signal processing. here, we studied another class of neurons, i.e., the vestibular-only neurons, in the vestibular nuclei that mediate vestibulospinal reflexes and provide information for higher brain areas. we investigated changes in the relative contribution of vestibular, neck proprioceptive, and efference copy signals in the response of these neurons during compensation after contralateral vestibular loss in macaca mulata monkeys. we show that the time course of recovery of vestibular sensitivity of neurons corresponds with that of lower extremity muscle and tendon reflexes reported in previous studies. more important, we found that information from neck proprioceptors, which did not influence neuronal responses before the lesion, were unmasked after lesion. such inputs influenced the early stages of the compensation process evidenced by faster and more substantial recovery of the resting discharge in proprioceptive-sensitive neurons. interestingly, unlike our previous study of vor interneurons, the improvement in the sensitivity of the two groups of neurons did not show any difference in the early or late stages after lesion. finally, neuronal responses during active head movements were not different before and after lesion and were attenuated relative to passive movements over the course of recovery, similar to that observed in control conditions. comparison of compensatory changes observed in the vestibuloocular and vestibulospinal pathways provides evidence for similarities and differences between the two classes of neurons that mediate these pathways at the functional and cellular levels.
a comparison of standard and compositional data analysis in studies addressing group differences in sedentary behavior and physical activity the associations between time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviors (sb) and physical activity with health are usually studied without taking into account that time is finite during the day, so time spent in each of these behaviors are codependent. therefore, little is known about the combined effect of time spent in sleep, sb and physical activity, that together constitute a composite whole, on obesity and cardio-metabolic health markers. cross-sectional analysis of nhanes 2005–6 cycle on n = 1937 adults, was undertaken using a compositional analysis paradigm, which accounts for this intrinsic codependence. time spent in sb, light intensity (lipa) and moderate to vigorous activity (mvpa) was determined from accelerometry and combined with self-reported sleep time to obtain the 24 hour time budget composition. the distribution of time spent in sleep, sb, lipa and mvpa is significantly associated with bmi, waist circumference, triglycerides, plasma glucose, plasma insulin (all p<0.001), and systolic (p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.003), but not hdl or ldl. within the composition, the strongest positive effect is found for the proportion of time spent in mvpa. strikingly, the effects of mvpa replacing another behavior and of mvpa being displaced by another behavior are asymmetric. for example, re-allocating 10 minutes of sb to mvpa was associated with a lower waist circumference by 0.001% but if 10 minutes of mvpa is displaced by sb this was associated with a 0.84% higher waist circumference. the proportion of time spent in lipa and sb were detrimentally associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease markers, but the association with sb was stronger. for diabetes risk markers, replacing sb with lipa was associated with more favorable outcomes. time spent in mvpa is an important target for intervention and preventing transfer of time from lipa to sb might lessen the negative effects of physical inactivity.
ontoloki: an automatic, instance-based method for the evaluation of biological ontologies on the semantic web the bio2rdf project uses a data integration approach based on semantic web rules to answer a broad question: what is known about the mouse and human genomes? using its rdfizing services, a semantic mashup of 65 million triples was built from 30 public bioinformatics data providers: go, ncbi, uniprot, kegg, pdb and many others. the average link-rank (alr) of a node is 4.7 which means that a usual topic is connected to 4.7 other topics by direct or reverse links within the warehouse. a knowledge map of the graph and descriptive statistics about its content are presented. a downloadable version of the bio2rdf atlas graph in n3 format is available at http://bio2rdf.org/download.
robustness of massively parallel sequencing platforms high-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally important variants. to fill these unmet needs, we developed the annovar tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (snvs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 genomes project and dbsnp. annovar can utilize annotation databases from the ucsc genome browser or any annotation data set conforming to generic feature format version 3 (gff3). we also illustrate a ‘variants reduction’ protocol on 4.7 million snvs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. using a desktop computer, annovar requires ∼4 min to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day. annovar is freely available at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/.
learning to rank using high-order information machine learning is commonly used to improve ranked retrieval systems. due to computational difficulties, few learning techniques have been developed to directly optimize for mean average precision (map), despite its widespread use in evaluating such systems. existing approaches optimizing map either do not find a globally optimal solution, or are computationally expensive. in contrast, we present a general svm learning algorithm that efficiently finds a globally optimal solution to a straightforward relaxation of map. we evaluate our approach using the trec 9 and trec 10 web track corpora (wt10g), comparing against svms optimized for accuracy and rocarea. in most cases we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements in map scores.
a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
normality of oligonucleotide microarray data and implications for parametric statistical analyses recent advances in cdna and oligonucleotide dna arrays have made it possible to measure the abundance of mrna transcripts for many genes simultaneously. the analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. the analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. however, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. as a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. we also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.
sequential event prediction with association rules collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. in this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical bayesian methods. we compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. we use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. the first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. the second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. this metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list.    experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metr rics for the various algorithms. results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. between correlation and bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.
taxonomic differences in deciduous upper second molar crown outlines of homo sapiens, homo neanderthalensis and homo erectus. the appearance of anatomically modern humans in europe and the nature of the transition from the middle to upper palaeolithic are matters of intense debate. most researchers accept that before the arrival of anatomically modern humans, neanderthals had adopted several ‘transitional’ technocomplexes. two of these, the uluzzian of southern europe and the châtelperronian of western europe, are key to current interpretations regarding the timing of arrival of anatomically modern humans in the region and their potential interaction with neanderthal populations. they are also central to current debates regarding the cognitive abilities of neanderthals and the reasons behind their extinction. however, the actual fossil evidence associated with these assemblages is scant and fragmentary, and recent work has questioned the attribution of the châtelperronian to neanderthals on the basis of taphonomic mixing and lithic analysis. here we reanalyse the deciduous molars from the grotta del cavallo (southern italy), associated with the uluzzian and originally classified as neanderthal. using two independent morphometric methods based on microtomographic data, we show that the cavallo specimens can be attributed to anatomically modern humans. the secure context of the teeth provides crucial evidence that the makers of the uluzzian technocomplex were therefore not neanderthals. in addition, new chronometric data for the uluzzian layers of grotta del cavallo obtained from associated shell beads and included within a bayesian age model show that the teeth must date to ∼45,000–43,000 calendar years before present. the cavallo human remains are therefore the oldest known european anatomically modern humans, confirming a rapid dispersal of modern humans across the continent before the aurignacian and the disappearance of neanderthals.
effect of antiretroviral drugs on maternal cd4 lymphocyte counts, hiv-1 rna levels, and anthropometric parameters of their neonates. percentile curves representing intrauterine growth of caucasian infants in colorado are constructed from the birthweights of liveborn infants at gestational ages ranging from 24 to 42 weeks. the median weights of colorado babies were found to be lower at 40 weeks of gestation than the national median, and mean weights at 40 and 42 weeks were lower than those given by other authors. the use of the intrauterine growth chart in studying the nutrition of babies at birth and during their postnatal growth period has been described.
bronchial responsiveness in patients with restrictive spirometry series “ats/ers task force: standardisation of lung function testing”   edited by v. brusasco, r. crapo and g. viegi   number 5 in this series         this section is written to provide guidance in interpreting pulmonary function tests (pfts) to medical directors of hospital-based laboratories that perform pfts, and physicians who are responsible for interpreting the results of pfts most commonly ordered for clinical purposes. specifically, this section addresses the interpretation of spirometry, bronchodilator response, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity ( d l,co) and lung volumes.  the sources of variation in lung function testing and technical aspects of spirometry, lung volume measurements and d l,co measurement have been considered in other documents published in this series of task force reports 1–4 and in the american thoracic society (ats) interpretative strategies document 5.  an interpretation begins with a review and comment on test quality. tests that are less than optimal may still contain useful information, but interpreters should identify the problems and the direction and magnitude of the potential errors. omitting the quality review and relying only on numerical results for clinical decision making is a common mistake, which is more easily made by those who are dependent upon computer interpretations.  once quality has been assured, the next steps involve a series of comparisons 6 that include comparisons of test results with reference values based on healthy subjects 5, comparisons with known disease or abnormal physiological patterns ( i.e. obstruction and restriction), and comparisons with self, a rather formal term for evaluating change in an individual patient. a final step in the lung function report is to answer the clinical question that prompted the test.  poor choices made during these preparatory steps increase the risk of misclassification, i.e. a falsely negative or falsely positive interpretation for a lung function abnormality or a change …
the role of estrogens in control of energy balance and glucose homeostasis. aims/hypothesiswe used oestrogen receptor-α (erα) knockout (erko) and receptor-β (erβ) knockout (berko) mice to investigate the mechanism(s) behind the effects of oestrogens on glucose homeostasis.methodsendogenous glucose production (egp) was measured in erko mice using a euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp. insulin secretion was determined from isolated islets. in isolated muscles, glucose uptake was assayed by using radiolabelled isotopes. genome-wide expression profiles were analysed by high-density oligonucleotide microarray assay, and the expression of the genes encoding steroyl-coa desaturase and the leptin receptor (scd1 and lepr, respectively) was confirmed by rt-pcr.resultserko mice had higher fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin levels and igt. the plasma leptin level was increased, while the adiponectin concentration was decreased in erko mice. levels of both glucose- and arginine-induced insulin secretion from isolated islets were similar in erko and wild-type mice. the euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp revealed that suppression of egp by increased insulin levels was blunted in erko mice, which suggests a pronounced hepatic insulin resistance. microarray analysis revealed that in erko mice, the genes involved in hepatic lipid biosynthesis were upregulated, while genes involved in lipid transport were downregulated. notably, hepatic lepr expression was decreased in erko mice. in vitro studies showed a modest decrease in insulin-mediated glucose uptake in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (edl) muscles of erko mice. berko mice demonstrated normal glucose tolerance and insulin release.conclusions/interpretationwe conclude that oestrogens, acting via erα, regulate glucose homeostasis mainly by modulating hepatic insulin sensitivity, which can be due to the upregulation of lipogenic genes via the suppression of lepr expression.
on the road to the internet of biometric things: a survey of fingerprint acquisition technologies and fingerprint databases large-scale fingerprint recognition involves capturing ridge patterns at different time intervals using various methods, such as live-scan and paper-ink approaches, introducing intraclass variations in the fingerprint. the performance of existing algorithms is significantly affected when fingerprints are captured with diverse acquisition settings such as multisession, multispectral, multiresolution, with slap, and with latent fingerprints. one of the primary challenges in developing a generic and robust fingerprint matching algorithm is the limited availability of large data sets that capture such intraclass diversity. in this paper, we present the multisensor optical and latent fingerprint database of more than 19000 fingerprint images with different intraclass variations during fingerprint capture. we also showcase the baseline results of various matching experiments on this database. the database is aimed to drive research in building robust algorithms toward solving the problem of latent fingerprint matching and handling intraclass variations in fingerprint capture. some potential applications for this database are identified and the research challenges that can be addressed using this database are also discussed.
a detailed history of intron-rich eukaryotic ancestors inferred from a global survey of 100 complete genomes summary a generalization of the sampling method introduced by metropolis et al. (1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in monte carlo estimates. examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed. for numerical problems in a large number of dimensions, monte carlo methods are often more efficient than conventional numerical methods. however, implementation of the monte carlo methods requires sampling from high dimensional probability distributions and this may be very difficult and expensive in analysis and computer time. general methods for sampling from, or estimating expectations with respect to, such distributions are as follows. (i) if possible, factorize the distribution into the product of one-dimensional conditional distributions from which samples may be obtained. (ii) use importance sampling, which may also be used for variance reduction. that is, in order to evaluate the integral j = x) p(x)dx = ev(f), where p(x) is a probability density function, instead of obtaining independent samples xi, ..., xv from p(x) and using the estimate j, = zf(xi)/n, we instead obtain the sample from a distribution with density q(x) and use the estimate j2 = y{f(xj)p(x1)}/{q(xj)n}. this may be advantageous if it is easier to sample from q(x) thanp(x), but it is a difficult method to use in a large number of dimensions, since the values of the weights w(xi) = p(x1)/q(xj) for reasonable values of n may all be extremely small, or a few may be extremely large. in estimating the probability of an event a, however, these difficulties may not be as serious since the only values of w(x) which are important are those for which x -a. since the methods proposed by trotter & tukey (1956) for the estimation of conditional expectations require the use of importance sampling, the same difficulties may be encountered in their use. (iii) use a simulation technique; that is, if it is difficult to sample directly from p(x) or if p(x) is unknown, sample from some distribution q(y) and obtain the sample x values as some function of the corresponding y values. if we want samples from the conditional dis
evaluating an expectation-driven qud model of discourse interpretation this paper identifies several serious problems with the widespread use of anovas for the analysis of categorical outcome variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy, choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. i show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, anova can yield spurious results. i discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. specifically, i introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over anova. unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. to address this issue, i describe mixed logit models (generalized linear mixed models for binomially distributed outcomes, breslow & clayton, 1993), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. throughout the paper, i use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.
genetic studies of complex human diseases: characterizing snp-disease associations using bayesian networks summary. we consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pd for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. in general pd approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. its properties in exponential families are explored. the posterior mean deviance is suggested as a bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. adding pd to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. the procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative bayesian and classical proposals. throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a markov chain monte carlo analysis.
effects of grasping force magnitude on the coordination of digit forces in multi-finger prehension this study examines various optimization criteria as potential sources of constraints that eliminate (or at least reduce the degree of) mechanical redundancy in prehension. a model of nonvertical grasping mimicking the experimental conditions of pataky et al. (current issue) was developed and numerically optimized. several cost functions compared well with experimental data including energylike functions, entropylike functions, and a ‘‘motor command’’ function. a tissue deformation function failed to predict finger forces. in the prehension literature, the ‘‘safety margin’’ (sm) measure has been used to describe grasp quality. we demonstrate here that the sm is an inappropriate measure for nonvertical grasps. we introduce a new measure, the ‘‘generalized safety margin’’ (gsm), which reduces to the sm for vertical and two-digit grasps. it was found that a close-to-constant gsm accounts for many of the finger force patterns that are observed when grasping an object oriented arbitrarily with respect to the gravity field. it was hypothesized that, when determining finger forces, the cns assumes that a grasped object is more slippery than it actually is. an ‘‘operative friction coefficient’’ of approximately 30\% of the actual coefficient accounted for the offset between experimental and optimized data. the data suggest that the cns utilizes an optimization strategy when coordinating finger forces during grasping.
machine comprehension using squad and deep learning training deep neural networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. this slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. we refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. batch normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for dropout. applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, batch normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on imagenet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.
assessing cancer health literacy among spanish-speaking latinos this article describes the adaptation and initial validation of the cancer health literacy test (chlt) for spanish speakers. a cross-sectional field test of the spanish version of the chlt (chlt-30-dkspa) was conducted among healthy latinos in louisiana. diagonally weighted least squares was used to confirm the factor structure. item response analysis using 2-parameter logistic estimates was used to identify questions that may require modification to avoid bias. cronbach’s alpha coefficients estimated scale internal consistency reliability. analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in chlt-30-dkspa scores by gender, origin, age and education. the mean chlt-30-dkspa score (n = 400) was 17.13 (range = 0–30, sd = 6.65). results confirmed a unidimensional structure, χ2(405) = 461.55, p = .027, comparative fit index = .993, tucker–lewis index = .992, root mean square error of approximation = .0180. cronbach’s alpha was .88. items q1-high calorie and q15-tumor spread had the lowest item–scale correlations (.148 and .288, respectively) and standardized factor loadings (.152 and .302, respectively). items q19-smoking risk, q8-palliative care, and q1-high calorie had the highest item difficulty parameters (difficulty = 1.12, 1.21, and 2.40, respectively). results generally support the applicability of the chlt-30-dkspa for healthy spanish-speaking populations, with the exception of 4 items that need to be deleted or revised and further studied: q1, q8, q15, and q19.
on the analysis of genome-wide association studies in family-based designs: a universal, robust analysis approach and an application to four genome-wide association studies in the present article, we address family-based association tests (fbats) for quantitative traits. we propose an approach to analytical power and sample-size calculations for general fbats; this approach can be applied to virtually any scenario (missing parental information, multiple offspring per family, etc.). the power calculations are used to discuss optimal choices of the phenotypes for the fbat statistic and its power's dependence on ascertainment conditions, on study design, and on the correct specification of the distributional assumptions for the phenotypes. we also compare the general fbat approach with pdt and qtdt. the practical relevance of our theoretical considerations is illustrated by their application to an asthma study.

an efficient agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation of “egusi” melon (colocynthis citrullus l.) dramatic progress has been made in the development of gene transfer systems for higher plants. the ability to introduce foreign genes into plant cells and tissues and to regenerate viable, fertile plants has allowed for explosive expansion of our understanding of plant biology and has provided an unparalleled opportunity to modify and improve crop plants. genetic engineering of plants offers significant potential for seed, agrichemical, food processing, specialty chemical, and pharmaceutical industries to develop new products and manufacturing processes. the extent to which genetically engineered plants will have an impact on key industries will be determined both by continued technical progress and by issues such as regulatory approval, proprietary protection, and public perception.

association between angiogenesis soluble factors and disease progression markers in chronic hepatitis c patients. angiotensin ii (ang ii)-mediated signals are transmitted via heparin binding epidermal growth factor (egf)-like growth factor (hb-egf) release followed by transactivation of egf receptor (egfr). although ang ii and hb-egf induce angiogenesis, their link to the angiopoietin (ang)-tie2 system remains undefined. we tested the effects of ang ii on ang1, ang2, or tie2 expression in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells expressing the ang ii receptors at(1) and at(2). ang ii significantly induced ang2 mrna accumulations without affecting ang1 or tie2 expression, which was inhibited by protein kinase c inhibitors and by intracellular ca(2+) chelating agents. ang ii transactivated egfr via at(1), and inhibition of egfr abolished the induction of ang2. ang ii caused processing of pro-hb-egf in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner to stimulate maturation and release of hb-egf. neutralizing anti-hb-egf antibody blocked egfr phosphorylation by ang ii. ang ii also upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) expression in an hb-egf/egfr-dependent manner. at(2) inhibited at(1)-mediated ang2 expression and phosphorylation of egfr. in an in vivo corneal assay, at(1) induced angiogenesis in an hb-egf-dependent manner and enhanced the angiogenic activity of vegf. although neither ang2 nor ang1 alone induced angiogenesis, soluble tie2-fc that binds to angiopoietins attenuated at(1)-mediated angiogenesis. these findings suggested that (1) ang ii induces ang2 and vegf expression without affecting ang1 or tie2 and (2) at(1) stimulates processing of pro-hb-egf by metalloproteinases, and the released hb-egf transactivates egfr to induce angiogenesis via the combined effect of ang2 and vegf, whereas at(2) attenuates them by blocking egfr phosphorylation. thus, ang ii is involved in the vegf-ang-tie2 system via hb-egf-mediated egfr transactivation, and this link should be considerable in pathological conditions in which collateral blood flow is required.
response of vallisneria spinulosa (hydrocharitaceae) to contrasting nitrogen loadings in controlled lake mesocosms abstract two freshwater macrophytes, ottelia alismoides and o. acuminata, were grown at low (mean 5 μmol l−1) and high (mean 400 μmol l−1) co2 concentrations under natural conditions. the ratio of pepc to rubisco activity was 1.8 in o. acuminata in both treatments. in o. alismoides, this ratio was 2.8 and 5.9 when grown at high and low co2, respectively, as a result of a twofold increase in pepc activity. the activity of ppdk was similar to, and changed with, pepc (1.9-fold change). the activity of the decarboxylating nadp-malic enzyme (me) was very low in both species, while nad-me activity was high and increased with pepc activity in o. alismoides. these results suggest that o. alismoides might perform a type of c4 metabolism with nad-me decarboxylation, despite lacking kranz anatomy. the c4-activity was still present at high co2 suggesting that it could be constitutive. o. alismoides at low co2 showed diel acidity variation of up to 34 μequiv g−1 fw indicating that it may also operate a form of crassulacean acid metabolism (cam). ph-drift experiments showed that both species were able to use bicarbonate. in o. acuminata, the kinetics of carbon uptake were altered by co2 growth conditions, unlike in o. alismoides. thus, the two species appear to regulate their carbon concentrating mechanisms differently in response to changing co2. o. alismoides is potentially using three different concentrating mechanisms. the hydrocharitaceae have many species with evidence for c4, cam or some other metabolism involving organic acids, and are worthy of further study.
contrast-processing dysfunction in both magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in migraineurs with or without aura. purpose frequency-doubling technology (fdt) perimetry was developed as a screening test for glaucoma. patients with damage to the neuro-ophthalmic sensory visual pathways have different patterns of visual loss than patients with glaucoma. the current study was designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of fdt as a screening test, compared with conventional automated perimetry (cap) in neuro-ophthalmic disorders and to test the extent to which it may isolate the m(y) cells.   methods fdt and cap were performed in 97 patients with sensory neuro-ophthalmic disorders and 42 subjects from the general population. the total and pattern-deviation probability plots for test loci common to the two perimetric tests were compared. the gold standard was an unequivocal clinical diagnosis.   results the sensitivity of fdt was 81.3%, with a specificity of 76.2%. the difference in sensitivity and specificity of cap, 87.5% and 81.0%, respectively, was not statistically significant (by chi(2) test). in subjects with optic neuropathies, the similarity of the defect shown on fdt and cap was judged good or fair in 62 of 72 cases. the extent of the defect as seen with fdt and cap was equal in 41 of 72 cases, more extensive with fdt in 12, and more extensive with cap in 19. in the patients with hemianopia, scattered abnormal test locations with fdt testing masked the hemianopic nature of the defect in 15 of 25 patients. also, test locations along the vertical midline in densely hemianopic areas were seen with fdt testing in some patients with hemianopia, probably due to light scatter across the vertical midline and into the uninvolved hemianopic field.   conclusions fdt has sensitivity and specificity similar to that of cap for detecting visual field defects in patients with optic neuropathies. however, defects in patients with hemianopias may be missed because of the presence of scattered abnormal test locations and failure to detect test locations along the vertical meridian. the defects demonstrated by both tests in patients with optic neuropathies are similar in number, extent, and shape of the defects. this suggests fdt may not be isolating the magnocellular (m) cells with nonlinear responses to stimulus contrast (m(y) cells) in patients with visual loss.
a note on the o(n)-storage implementation of the gko algorithm and its adaptation to trummer-like matrices recent research shows that structured matrices such as toeplitz and hankel matrices can be transformed into a different class of structured matrices called cauchy-like matrices using the fft or other trigonometric transforms. gohberg, kailath, and olshevsky [math. comp., 64 (1995), pp. 1557--1576] demonstrate numerically that their fast variation of the straightforward gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (gepp) procedure on cauchy-like matrices is numerically stable. sweet and brent [adv. signal proc. algorithms, 2363 (1995), pp. 266--280] show that the error growth in this variation could be much larger than would be encountered with straightforward gepp in certain cases. in this paper, we present a modified algorithm that avoids such extra error growth and can perform a fast variation of gaussian elimination with complete pivoting (gecp). our analysis shows that it is both efficient and numerically stable, provided that the element growth in the computed factorization is not large. we also present a more efficient variation of this algorithm and discuss implementation techniques that further reduce execution time. our numerical experiments show that this variation is highly efficient and numerically stable.
automatic image annotation with real-world community contributed data set image auto-annotation is an important open problem in computer vision. for this task we propose tagprop, a discriminatively trained nearest neighbor model. tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. tagprop allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. in this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. we also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. we investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. we present experimental results for three challenging data sets. on all three, tagprop makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art.
cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia background: cryoablation has emerged as a new, theoretically safer, modality for treating atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (avnrt). the purpose of this study is to compare procedural aspects and outcomes during the transition from radiofrequency (rf) ablation to cryoablation for pediatric avnrt.
comparative incidence of conformational, neurodegenerative disorders objectives frontotemporal dementia (ftd) is considered to be a mainly early-onset neurodegenerative disorder with a strong hereditary component. the aim of the study was to investigate age-related incidence and family history in ftd compared to other dementia disorders, especially alzheimer's disease (ad). methods the swedish dementia registry (svedem) registers all new cases of dementia diagnosed by the participating centres, including data on demographics, diagnosis, and investigations used. data for the period 2008–2011 were extracted and compared with age-related population data on a regional and national level. results there were 20 305 patients registered in svedem during 2008–2011, whereof 352 received a diagnosis of ftd. mean age at diagnosis for ftd was 69.6 years and almost 70% of ftd cases were 65 years or older at the time of diagnosis. both ftd and ad showed an increased incidence with age, which reached a maximum in the age group 80–84 years at 6.04 and 202 cases per 100 000 person-years, respectively. the proportion of cases with a positive family history was significantly lower in ftd than in ad. conclusions contrary to general opinion within the field, data from svedem show that the incidence of ftd increases with age, and that the majority of cases are diagnosed after the age of 65 years. in addition, data from svedem might suggest that the importance of hereditary factors in general is similar in ftd and ad. the recognition of these findings has important consequences for the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with ftd.
steady‐state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in hospitalized patients drug-resistant microorganisms have become a major problem around the world. in nosocomial and community settings, many important pathogens have demonstrated high-grade resistance to many of our most important agents. in addition, the adverse impact of resistance has not been limited to the bacterial realm. in chemotherapy to treat human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and other viral diseases, resistance has become a major problem. we are starting to see the beginnings of a resistance problem, even among fungi. strangely, little attention has been focused on the impact of dosing on the probability with which emergence of resistance occurs. after delineation of the pharmacodynamically linked variable, it is possible to generate dosing regimens that can lower the probability of resistance. in addition, circumstances exist in which combination therapy may be required (e.g., therapy of hiv and tuberculosis). here, too, it is possible to optimize therapy to prevent resistance by understanding how the drugs in the regimen interact. we can do better with our choices of dose, schedule, and combinations of agents. we will need to lower the probability of resistance and maintain the utility of the drugs currently in our therapeutic armamentarium.
wander join and xdb: online aggregation via random walks dbo is a database system that utilizes randomized algorithms to give statistically meaningful estimates for the final answer to a multi-table, disk-based query from start to finish during query execution. however, dbo's "time 'til utility" (or "ttu"; that is, the time until dbo can give a useful estimate) can be overly large, particularly in the case that many database tables are joined in a query, or in the case that a join query includes a very selective predicate on one or more of the tables, or when the data are skewed. in this paper, we describe turbo dbo, which is a prototype database system that can answer multi-table join queries in a scalable fashion, just like dbo. however, turbo dbo often has a much lower ttu than dbo. the key innovation of turbo dbo is that it makes use of novel algorithms that look for and remember "partial match" tuples in a randomized fashion. these are tuples that satisfy some of the boolean predicates associated with the query, and can possibly be grown into tuples that actually contribute to the final query result at a later time.
protective effect of hesperidin in a model of parkinson's disease induced by 6-hydroxydopamine in aged mice. a novel test procedure for antidepressants was designed in which a mouse is suspended by the tail from a lever, the movements of the animal being recorded. the total duration of the test (6 min) can be divided into periods of agitation and immobility. several psychotropic drugs were studied: amphetamine, amttriptyline, atropine, desipramine, mianserin, nomifensine and viloxazine. antidepressant drugs decrease the duration of immobility, as do psychostimulants and atropine. if coupled with measurement of locomotor activity in different conditions, the test can separate the locomotor stimulant doses from antidepressant doses. diazepam increases the duration of immobility.the main advantages of this procedure are (1) the use of a simple, objective test situation, (2) the concordance of the results with the validated “behavioral despair” test from porsolt and, (3) the sensitivity to a wide range of drug doses.
progression inference for somatic mutations in cancer backgroundthe early to intermediate stages of the majority of colorectal tumours are thought to be driven by aberrations in the wnt (apc, ctnnb1) and ras (k-ras) pathways. a smaller proportion of cancers shows mismatch repair deficiency. the aim of this study was to analyse the co-occurrence of these genetic alterations in relation to tumour and patient characteristics.methodsin a group of 656 unselected sporadic colorectal cancer patients, aberrations in the apc, k-ras, ctnnb1 genes, and expression of hmlh1 were investigated. additionally, tumours were divided in groups based on molecular features and compared with respect to patient's age at diagnosis, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, tumour sub-localisation, dukes' stage and differentiation.resultsmutations at the phosphorylation sites (codons 31, 33, 37, and 45) in the ctnnb1 gene were observed in tumours from only 5/464 patients. tumours with truncating apc mutations and activating k-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 occurred at similar frequencies (37% (245/656) and 36% (235/656), respectively). seventeen percent of tumours harboured both an apc and a k-ras mutation (109/656). nine percent of all tumours (58/656) lacked hmlh1 expression. patients harbouring a tumour with absent hmlh1 expression were older, more often women, more often had proximal colon tumours that showed poorer differentiation when compared to patients harbouring tumours with an apc and/or k-ras mutation.conclusionctnnb1 mutations seem to be of minor importance in sporadic colorectal cancer. the main differences in tumour and patient characteristics are found between groups of patients based on mismatch repair deficiency.
topic models for mortality modeling in intensive care units objective:we sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. this freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. design:data collection and retrospective analysis. setting:all adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. patients:adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. interventions:none. measurements and main results:the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care ii (mimic-ii) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. the investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, international classification of diseases, 9th revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. data were automatically deidentified to comply with health insurance portability and accountability act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. the data were made freely available in february 2010 through the internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. the overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7%, which varied by critical care unit. the median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1–4.4 days). according to the primary international classification of diseases, 9th revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1%); trauma (10.2%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7%); pulmonary diseases (9.0%); infectious diseases (7.0%); and neoplasms (6.8%). conclusions:mimic-ii documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. it establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.
retrospective review of effectiveness and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose given to children with iron deficiency anaemia in one uk tertiary centre objective to assess the benefits and risks of intravenous (iv) ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) in children with iron deficiency anemia (ida). study design in a retrospective cohort study of patients seen at our center, we identified all fcm infusions in children with ida over a 12‐month period through a query of pharmacy records. clinical data, including hematologic response and adverse effects, were extracted from the electronic medical record. results a total of 116 iv fcm infusions were administered to 72 patients with ida refractory to oral iron treatment (median age, 13.7 years; range, 9 months to 18 years). median preinfusion and postinfusion hemoglobin values were 9.1 g/dl and 12.3 g/dl, respectively (at 4‐12 weeks after the initial infusion; n = 53). sixty‐five patients (84%) experienced no adverse effects. minor transient complications were encountered during or immediately after 7 infusions. conclusion fcm administered as a short iv infusion without a test dose proved to be safe and highly effective in a small yet diverse population of infants, children, and adolescents with ida refractory to oral iron therapy.
formation of a functional maize centromere after loss of centromeric sequences and gain of ectopic sequences[c][w] summary: a motif is a short dna or protein sequence that contributes to the biological function of the sequence in which it resides. over the past several decades, many computational methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching with sequence motifs. critical to nearly any motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific frequency matrix. results: we describe find individual motif occurrences (fimo), a software tool for scanning dna or protein sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. the program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a p-value and then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequence. fimo provides output in a variety of formats, including html, xml and several santa cruz genome browser formats. the program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of dna sequences at a rate of 3.5 mb/s on a single cpu. availability and implementation: fimo is part of the meme suite software toolkit. a web server and source code are available at http://meme.sdsc.edu. contact: t.bailey@imb.uq.edu.au; t.bailey@imb.uq.edu.au supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
integration of genetic fuzzy systems and artificial neural networks for stock price forecasting this paper presents a novel combination of the hidden markov model (hmm) and the fuzzy models for forecasting stock market data. in a previous study we used an hmm to identify similar data patterns from the historical data and then used a weighted average to generate a 'one-day-ahead' forecast. this paper uses a similar approach to identify data patterns by using the hmm and then uses fuzzy logic to obtain a forecast value. the hmm's log-likelihood for each of the input data vectors is used to partition the dataspace. each of the divided dataspaces is then used to generate a fuzzy rule. the fuzzy model developed from this approach is tested on stock market data drawn from different sectors. experimental results clearly show an improved forecasting accuracy compared to other forecasting models such as, arima, artificial neural network (ann) and another hmm-based forecasting model.
neurotrophic and neuroimmune responses to early-life pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in rat lungs. nerve growth factor (ngf) controls sensorineural development and responsiveness and modulates immunoinflammatory reactions. respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) potentiates the proinflammatory effects of sensory nerves in rat airways by upregulating the substance p receptor, neurokinin 1 (nk(1)). we investigated whether the expression of ngf and its trka and p75 receptors in the lungs is age dependent, whether it is upregulated during rsv infection, and whether it affects neurogenic inflammation. pathogen-free rats were killed at 2 (weanling) to 12 (adult) wk of age; in addition, subgroups of rats were inoculated with rsv or virus-free medium. in pathogen-free rats, expression of ngf and its receptors in the lungs declined with age, but rsv doubled expression of ngf, trka, and p75 in weanling and adult rats. exogenous ngf upregulated nk(1) receptor expression in the lungs. anti-ngf antibody inhibited nk(1) receptor upregulation and neurogenic inflammation in rsv-infected lungs. these data indicate that expression of ngf and its receptors in the lungs declines physiologically with age but is upregulated by rsv and is a major determinant of neurogenic inflammation.
results of iliac stenting and aortofemoral grafting for iliac artery occlusions. purpose to summarize mortality, morbidity, and long-term patency data of bifurcated aortoiliac or aortofemoral bypass graft procedures in aortoiliac occlusive disease.   methods a medline search was performed of the medical literature published between 1970 and 1996. studies were included if (1) they reported patency rates based on life tables and the number at risk was provided at yearly intervals; and (2) patient and study characteristics were reported in sufficient detail. mortality and morbidity risks were pooled using a fixed-effects model. the patency data were combined using a technique that enables adjustment for differences across studies in patient characteristics or reporting methods. in the current analysis, we corrected for the symptomatic status of the patients at the time of surgery (claudication vs ischemia) and the unit of observation used in reporting the patency (limb vs patient).   results we identified 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria. the aggregated operative mortality risk in the older studies (started before 1975) was 4.6%, as compared with 3.3% in the more recent studies (p = 0.01). the aggregated systemic morbidity risk was 13.1% in the older studies and 8.3% in the more recent studies (p < 0.001). limb-based patency rates for patients with claudication were 91.0% and 86.8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, as compared with 87.5% and 81.8% for patients with ischemia. patency rates reported in the older studies were markedly similar to those of more recent studies (p = 0.58).   conclusions our study suggests that mortality and systemic morbidity rates of aortic bifurcation graft procedures have dropped since 1975, whereas patency rates seem to be fairly constant over the years.
non-negative spherical deconvolution (nnsd) for estimation of fiber orientation distribution function in single-/multi-shell diffusion mri this paper describes a new nmr imaging modality--mr diffusion tensor imaging. it consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. we show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these nmr methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. once deff is estimated from a series of nmr pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. they coincide with the eigenvectors of deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of deff. diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. moreover, the three scalar invariants of deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. inherently tensors (like deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, t1, and t2) do not.
effects of different levels of compression during sub-maximal and high-intensity exercise on erythrocyte deformability stocking supports have represented, for more than two millennia, the most efficient way to treat the veinous diseases and lymphatic disorders. although this treatment consists solely in the application of a mechanical pressure to help the blood in reaching back the heart, very little is known on this mechanical effort exerted on a human limb by knitted fabrics. however, nowadays the precise assessment of this pressure distribution is crucial in fitting the treatment to the patient pathology and morphology. in order to describe rationally, for the first time, the pressure distribution induced on a leg, a combined experiment-simulation 2d methodology has been set to validate this mechanical approach. the present article is the first part of a two-papers communication. experimental aspects are presented here, first to measure these stocking pressures on a rigid leg using the sigat((r)) device based on a pneumatic sensor. then, the knitted fabric mechanical response is characterized under uniaxial tension for large strains, to evaluate the simplified laplace-based pressure that can be compared with the pressure measurements, knowing the local curvature radii of a leg section. this experimental approach is to be completed with numerical simulations of the stocking mechanism on the same model leg.
episodic memory in schizophrenia: the influence of strategy use on behavior and brain activation neuroimaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal areas in the successful encoding of verbal material into episodic memory. the present study used event-related functional mri to investigate whether the brain areas associated with successful episodic encoding of words in a semantic study task are a subset of those demonstrating depth of processing effects. in addition, we tested whether the brain areas associated with successful episodic encoding differ depending on the nature of the study task. at study, 15 volunteers were cued to make either animacy or alphabetical decisions about words. a recognition memory test including confidence judgements followed after a delay of 15 min. prefrontal and medial temporal regions showed greater functional mri activations for semantically encoded words relative to alphabetically encoded words. two of these regions (left anterior hippocampus and left ventral inferior frontal gyrus) showed greater activation for semantically encoded words that were subsequently recognized confidently. however, other regions (left posterior hippocampus and right inferior frontal cortex) demonstrated subsequent memory effects, but not effects of depth of processing. successful memory for alphabetically encoded words was also associated with greater activation in the left anterior hippocampus and left ventral inferior frontal gyrus. the findings suggest that episodic encoding for words in a semantic study task involves a subset of the regions activated by deep relative to shallow processing. the data provide little evidence that successful episodic encoding during a shallow study task depends upon regions different from those that support the encoding of deeply studied words. instead, the findings suggest that successful episodic encoding during a shallow study task relies on a subset of the regions engaged during successful encoding in a deep task.
balance control and adaptation during vibratory perturbations in middle-aged and elderly humans abstract. the short-term (i.e., days) and long-term (i.e., months) effects of adaptation to posturography examinations were investigated in 12 normal subjects who were repeatedly examined for five consecutive days and again after 90 days. the examinations were conducted both with eyes open and closed, and the perturbations were evoked by a pseudorandomly applied vibration stimulation to the calf muscles. the evoked anteroposterior responses were analyzed with a method considering adaptation in the slow changes in posture and in the stimulus–response relationship. repetition of examinations on a daily basis revealed a gradual improvement of postural-control performance. the body sway induced by the stimulation was significantly reduced and the dynamical properties changed. most of the improvements remained after 90 days, but some parameters such as the complexity of the control system used were increased to the initial level. the results confirm previous observations that postural control contains several partially independent adaptive processes, observed in terms of alteration of posture and as a progressive reduction of body sway induced by stimulation. the method used for the adaptation analysis in this study could be applied to analyze biological systems with multiple individual adaptive processes with different time courses or characteristics, or where the adaptation processes are related to multiple internal or external factors.
a new method for estimation and control of temperature profile over a sheet in thermoforming process we describe approximate digital implementations of two new mathematical transforms, namely, the ridgelet transform and the curvelet transform. our implementations offer exact reconstruction, stability against perturbations, ease of implementation, and low computational complexity. a central tool is fourier-domain computation of an approximate digital radon transform. we introduce a very simple interpolation in the fourier space which takes cartesian samples and yields samples on a rectopolar grid, which is a pseudo-polar sampling set based on a concentric squares geometry. despite the crudeness of our interpolation, the visual performance is surprisingly good. our ridgelet transform applies to the radon transform a special overcomplete wavelet pyramid whose wavelets have compact support in the frequency domain. our curvelet transform uses our ridgelet transform as a component step, and implements curvelet subbands using a filter bank of a; trous wavelet filters. our philosophy throughout is that transforms should be overcomplete, rather than critically sampled. we apply these digital transforms to the denoising of some standard images embedded in white noise. in the tests reported here, simple thresholding of the curvelet coefficients is very competitive with "state of the art" techniques based on wavelets, including thresholding of decimated or undecimated wavelet transforms and also including tree-based bayesian posterior mean methods. moreover, the curvelet reconstructions exhibit higher perceptual quality than wavelet-based reconstructions, offering visually sharper images and, in particular, higher quality recovery of edges and of faint linear and curvilinear features. existing theory for curvelet and ridgelet transforms suggests that these new approaches can outperform wavelet methods in certain image reconstruction problems. the empirical results reported here are in encouraging agreement.
the cost of moving optimally: kinematic path selection. this paper introduces the min/max criterion for simulation of muscle recruitment in multiple muscle systems. the criterion is introduced and justified by comparison to two known criterion types: the polynomial criterion and the soft saturation criterion. the comparison is performed on a planar three-muscle elbow model performing a dumbbell curl. a generalized form of the soft saturation criterion is introduced, and it is shown that the min/max criterion can be interpreted as the limit of the classical criteria when the exponents in their mathematical expressions approach infinity. we finally show how the min/max criterion can be cast into a form that allows for efficient and robust numerical solution by linear programming. it is concluded that the min/max criterion possesses a number of attractive physiological as well as algorithmic advantages.
clinical usefulness of pit patterns for detecting colonic lesions requiring surgical treatment in colorectal cancers, although flat and depressed-type lesions are found by regular endoscopic view, magnification and pit-pattern observation are vital parts of the precise diagnosis of the lesion. the depressed-type lesions appear to have a prominent tendency to show malignant characteristics, and the recognition and timely treatment of such lesions is important for improving the morbidity and mortality of colorectal cancer. chromoscopy is mandatory for an accurate diagnosis of these lesions. the pit-pattern classification correlates well with actual histological findings and can provide important additional information prior to endoscopic treatment of the lesion.
comparing the biological impact of glatiramer acetate with the biological impact of a generic although genomewide rna expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. here, we describe a powerful analytical method called gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) for interpreting gene expression data. the method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. we demonstrate how gsea yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, gsea reveals many biological pathways in common. the gsea method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.
benefits of intraaortic balloon support for myocardial infarction patients in severe cardiogenic shock undergoing coronary revascularization background the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp-4) inhibitor, in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) after acute myocardial infarction (ami) are unclear.   methods we analyzed data from the taiwan national health insurance research database between march 1st, 2009 and december 31st, 2011. a total of 1025 ami patients with diabetes with chronic kidney disease were selected as the study cohort. the study evaluated the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of sitagliptin by comparing 205 subjects (20%) who use sitagliptin to 820 matched subjects (80%) who do not. the primary outcomes included myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or cardiovascular death.   results primary composite outcomes occurred in 54 patients in the sitagliptin group (26.3%) and in 164 patients in the comparison group (20.0%) (hr, 1.32; 95% ci, 0.97-1.79; p=0.079) during the mean follow-up of 1.02years (sd=0.71years). the sitagliptin group had similar risks of ischemic stroke, all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure (hf) compared to the non-sitagliptin group (p=0.938, 0.523 and 0.795 respectively). however, sitagliptin use was associated with increased risks of recurrent myocardial infarction (hr, 1.73; 95% ci, 1.15-2.58; p=0.008) and percutaneous coronary revascularization (hr, 1.43; 95% ci, 1.04-1.95; p=0.026).   conclusions among type 2 diabetic patients with ckd after ami, the use of sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke or hospitalization for hf but was associated with increased risks of recurrent mi and percutaneous coronary revascularization.
identification of functional differences in metabolic networks using comparative genomics and constraint-based models genome-scale metabolic models have proven to be valuable for predicting organism phenotypes from genotypes. yet efforts to develop new models are failing to keep pace with genome sequencing. to address this problem, we introduce the model seed, a web-based resource for high-throughput generation, optimization and analysis of genome-scale metabolic models. the model seed integrates existing methods and introduces techniques to automate nearly every step of this process, taking ∼48 h to reconstruct a metabolic model from an assembled genome sequence. we apply this resource to generate 130 genome-scale metabolic models representing a taxonomically diverse set of bacteria. twenty-two of the models were validated against available gene essentiality and biolog data, with the average model accuracy determined to be 66% before optimization and 87% after optimization.
comprehensive study of cd compensation and carrier phase estimation in optical communication systems influenced by equalization enhanced phase noise we demonstrate unrepeated 200-km transmission of 40-gbit/s 16-qam signals using a digital coherent receiver, where the decision-directed carrier-phase estimation is employed. the phase fluctuation is effectively eliminated in the 16-qam system with such a phase-estimation method, when the linewidth of semiconductor lasers for the transmitter and the local oscillator is 150 khz. finite-impulse-response (fir) filters at the receiver compensate for 4,000-ps/nm group-velocity dispersion (gvd) of the 200-km-long single-mode fiber and a part of self-phase modulation (spm) in the digital domain. in spite of the launched power limitation due to spm, the acceptable bit-error rate performance is obtained owing to high sensitivity of the digital coherent receiver.
application of various multiple criteria analysis methods for the evaluation of rural road projects this study describes the evaluation criteria involving three aspects of sustainability and finding their importance for ranking rural road projects. the evaluation criteria were derived from a thorough literature review and individual importance was determined via a google survey among different experts, who have worked on rural roads in nepal and other 22countries. this survey used analytic hierarchy process.thirteen sub criteria and three criteria were considered in the question on the survey and almost all of the respondents responded that these criteria and sub criteria were necessary in the criteria for the ranking of rural road projects fromthe point of sustainability. the result of the case study in dang district of nepal is also presented
inhibition during response preparation is sensitive to response complexity. top-down control processes are critical to select goal-directed actions in flexible environments. in humans, these processes include two inhibitory mechanisms that operate during response selection: one is involved in solving a competition between different response options, the other ensures that a selected response is initiated in a timely manner. here, we evaluated the role of dorsal premotor cortex (pmd) and lateral prefrontal cortex (lpf) of healthy subjects in these two forms of inhibition by using an innovative transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) protocol combining repetitive tms (rtms) over pmd or lpf and a single pulse tms (stms) over primary motor cortex (m1). stms over m1 allowed us to assess inhibitory changes in corticospinal excitability, while rtms was used to produce transient disruption of pmd or lpf. we found that rtms over lpf reduces inhibition associated with competition resolution, whereas rtms over pmd decreases inhibition associated with response impulse control. these results emphasize the dissociable contributions of these two frontal regions to inhibitory control during motor preparation. the association of lpf with competition resolution is consistent with the role of this area in relatively abstract aspects of control related to goal maintenance, ensuring that the appropriate response is selected in a variable context. in contrast, the association of pmd with impulse control is consistent with the role of this area in more specific processes related to motor preparation and initiation.
analysis of distributed temperature sensing based on raman scattering using otdr coding and discrete raman amplification in this letter, a coded, raman-based distributed temperature sensor system using 255-bit simplex coded optical time domain reflectometry (otdr) and optimized sensing link composed of cascaded fibers with different raman coefficients, is proposed. this system is compared to a system with an uncoded otdr on standard single-mode fiber, demonstrating significant enhancement in the interrogation distance (19.5 km from coding gain, and 9.6 km from link optimization). total sensing range of 37 km at 17-m/3-k spatial/temperature resolution were achieved, while employing conventional low power (80 mw) laser diodes
contribution of chronic disease to the burden of disability a continuing interest of the national center for health statistics is the development and evaluation of new health indices suited to diverse specific purposes. no one index can reflect all aspects of health, but there is considerable agreement that an index which measures some aspects of nonfatal illness as well as mortality would be desirable. a rationale for using both mortality and disability rates as the components of such an index has already been published (1). one technique for combining mortality and morbidity rates into a single index was devised and reported by chiang in conjunction with his development of mathematical models of illness frequency, illness duration, and mortality (2). moriyama has discussed criteria desired in an index of health and, in view of these, reviewed some approaches proposed in the literature (3). a deseription and evaluation of disability concepts and measures being considered as the basis of the morbidity component of a mortality-morbidity index appeared in a recent report (4). another technique for merging death rates with illness rates, and some illustrative results are described in this paper. a primary objective of these studies is development of a summary measure which reflects changes over time in the health status of the nation's population. too little is known as yet about these techniques, and in some cases about the data they employ, to permit thorough evaluation of alternative approaches to the construction of such indices. results of studies of such measures are presented as they become available by the center to stimulate consideration of the issues and, possibly, to stimulate further studies by those in a position to conduct related research. some preliminary index values based upon the techniques presented in this paper have already been published for fiscal years 1958-66 (5). the estimates in this article are also preliminary. although they relate to only a single year, they provide previously unpublished information on whites and other persons and on sex differences. these estimates are considered more accurate than earlier computations of such values.
electrochemical sensor for explosives precursors’ detection in water an original method for the enhancement of chemiluminescent (cl) on-chip detection of protein and oligonucleotides is presented. this enhancement is based on the electrodeposition of a gold nanostructured layer onto a screen-printed (sp) carbon microarray prior to the immobilization of biomolecules through a well-established diazonium adduct electrodeposition. morphological studies of the au layer (optical and atomic force microscopy) show that the metal film is composed of nanostructured 800 nm diameter particles covering the entire graphite surface and yielding a high surface area. using these modified sp microarrays, enhancement factors of 229 and 126 were obtained for prostate-specific antigen (psa) and p53 oligonucleotide detection, respectively. these enhancements were associated with three different phenomena: an enhancement of the catalyzed chemiluminescent reaction by the gold surface, an increase of the specific surface area for immobilization of the probe biomolecules, and an opposite quenching effect due to the overlapping of the gold absorption and cl emission peaks. for free psa and target oligonucleotide detection, enhanced performances were obtained, giving detection limits of 5 ng/ml and 0.1 nm, respectively.
large-scale determination of sequence, structure, and function relationships in cytosolic glutathione transferases across the biosphere the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium, a saprophytic basidiomycete, possesses a large number of cytosolic glutathione transferases, eight of them showing similarity to the omega class. pcgsto1 (subclass i, the bacterial homologs of which were recently proposed, based on their enzymatic function, to constitute a new class of glutathione transferase named s-glutathionyl-(chloro)hydroquinone reductases) and pcgsto3 (subclass ii related to mammalian homologs) have been investigated in this study. biochemical investigations demonstrate that both enzymes are able to catalyze deglutathionylation reactions thanks to the presence of a catalytic cysteinyl residue. this reaction leads to the formation of a disulfide bridge between the conserved cysteine and the removed glutathione from their substrate. the substrate specificity of each isoform differs. in particular pcgsto1, in contrast to pcgsto3, was found to catalyze deglutathionylation of s-glutathionyl-p-hydroquinone substrates. the three-dimensional structure of pcgsto1 presented here confirms the hypothesis that it belongs not only to a new biological class but also to a new structural class that we propose to name gst xi. indeed, it shows specific features, the most striking ones being a new dimerization mode and a catalytic site that is buried due to the presence of long loops and that contains the catalytic cysteine.
priority setting for the prevention and control of cardiovascular diseases: multi-criteria decision analysis in four eastern mediterranean countries the scientific knowledge to achieve a new global goal for the prevention of chronic diseases--a 2% yearly reduction in rates of death from chronic disease over and above projected declines during the next 10 years--already exists. however, many low-income and middle-income countries must deal with the practical realities of limited resources and a double burden of infectious and chronic diseases. this paper presents a novel planning framework that can be used in these contexts: the stepwise framework for preventing chronic diseases. the framework offers a flexible and practical public health approach to assist ministries of health in balancing diverse needs and priorities while implementing evidence-based interventions such as those recommended by the who framework convention on tobacco control and the who global strategy on diet, physical activity and health. countries such as indonesia, the philippines, tonga, and vietnam have applied the stepwise planning framework: their experiences illustrate how the stepwise approach has general applicability to solving chronic disease problems without sacrificing specificity for any particular country.
lightkit: a lighting system for effective visualization in shaded scenes surface features can appear either concave or convex, depending upon the viewer's judgement about the direction of the prevailing illumination. if other curvature cues are added to the image this ambiguity can be removed. however, it is not clear to what extent, if any, illuminant position exerts an influence on the perceived magnitude of surface curvature. subjects were presented with pairs of spherical surface patches in a curvature matching task. the patches were defined by shading and texture cues. the perceived curvature of a standard patch was measured as a function of light source position. we found a clear effect of light source position on apparent curvature. perceived curvature decreased as light source tilt increased and as light source slant decreased. we also found that the strength of this effect is determined partly by a surface's reflectance function and partly by the relative weight of the texture cue. when a specular component was added to the stimuli, the effect of light source orientation was weakened. the weight of the texture cue was manipulated by disrupting the regular distribution of texture elements. we found an inverse relationship between the strength of the effect and the weight of the texture cue: lowering the texture cue weight resulted in an enhancement of the illuminant position effect.
gemmatimonas aurantiaca gen. nov., sp. nov., a gram-negative, aerobic, polyphosphate-accumulating micro-organism, the first cultured representative of the new bacterial phylum gemmatimonadetes phyl. nov. a set of oligonucleotide primers capable of initiating enzymatic amplification (polymerase chain reaction) on a phylogenetically and taxonomically wide range of bacteria is described along with methods for their use and examples. one pair of primers is capable of amplifying nearly full-length 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) from many bacterial genera; the additional primers are useful for various exceptional sequences. methods for purification of amplified material, direct sequencing, cloning, sequencing, and transcription are outlined. an obligate intracellular parasite of bovine erythrocytes, anaplasma marginale, is used as an example; its 16s rdna was amplified, cloned, sequenced, and phylogenetically placed. anaplasmas are related to the genera rickettsia and ehrlichia. in addition, 16s rdnas from several species were readily amplified from material found in lyophilized ampoules from the american type culture collection. by use of this method, the phylogenetic study of extremely fastidious or highly pathogenic bacterial species can be carried out without the need to culture them. in theory, any gene segment for which polymerase chain reaction primer design is possible can be derived from a readily obtainable lyophilized bacterial culture.
assimilation of smos data for improving surface water management abstract the community microwave emission model (cmem) has been used to compute global l-band brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere. the input data comprise surface fields from the 40-yr ecmwf re-analysis (era-40), vegetation data from the ecoclimap dataset, and the food and agriculture organization’s (fao) soil database. modeled brightness temperatures have been compared against (historic) observations from the s-194 passive microwave radiometer onboard the skylab space station. different parameterizations for surface roughness and the vegetation optical depth have been used to calibrate the model. the best results have been obtained for rather simple approaches proposed by wigneron et al. and kirdyashev et al. the rms errors after calibration are 10.7 and 9.8 k for north and south america, respectively. comparing the era-40 soil moisture product against the corresponding in situ observations suggests that the uncertainty in the modeled soil moisture is the predominant contributor to these...
frequency-dependent modes of synaptic vesicle endocytosis and exocytosis at adult mouse neuromuscular junctions this paper compares the activity of hindlimb motor units from muscles mainly composed of fast-twitch muscle fibers (medial and lateral gastrocnemius: mg/lg, tibialis anterior: ta) to motor units from a muscle mainly composed of slow-twitch muscle fibers (soleus: sol) during unrestrained walking in the conscious rat. several differences in the activation profiles of motor units from these two groups of muscles were observed. for example, motor units from fast muscles (e.g., mg/lg and ta) fired at very high mean frequencies of discharge, ranging from 60 to 100 hz, and almost always were recruited with initial doublets or triplets, i.e., initial frequencies >/=100 hz. in contrast, the majority of sol units fired at much lower mean rates of discharge, approximately 30 hz, and had initial frequencies of only 30-60 hz (i.e., there were no initial doublets/triplets >/=100 hz). thus the presence of initial doublet or triplets was dependent on the intrinsic properties of the motor unit, i.e., faster units were recruited with a doublet/triplet more often than slower units. moreover, in contrast to units from the slow sol muscle, the activity of single motor units from the fast mg/lg muscle, especially units recruited midway or near the end of a locomotor burst, was unrelated to the activity of the remainder of the motoneuron pool, as measured by the corresponding gross-electromyographic (emg) signal. this dissociation of activity was suggested to arise from a compartmentalized recruitment of the mg/lg motoneuron pool by the rhythm-generating networks of the spinal cord. in contrast, when comparing the rate modulation of simultaneously recorded motor units within a single lg muscle compartment, the frequency profiles of unit pairs were modulated in a parallel fashion. this suggested that the parent motoneurons were responsive to changes in synaptic inputs during unrestrained walking, unlike the poor rate modulation that occurs during locomotion induced from brain stem stimulation. in summary, data from this study provide evidence that the firing behavior of motor units during unrestrained walking is influenced by both the intrinsic properties of the parent motoneuron and by synaptic inputs from the locomotor networks of the spinal cord. in addition, it also provides the first extensive description of motor-unit activity from different muscles during unrestrained walking in the conscious rat.
oxytocin increases autonomic cardiac control: moderation by loneliness oxytocin has a crucial role in social behaviour, although its effects on social cognition are not fully understood. past research shows that oxytocin enhances encoding and conceptual recognition of positive social stimuli over social-threat stimuli. in this study, we evaluated whether oxytocin modified responses to positive and threatening social stimuli at an earlier perceptual stage of processing using the visual search task. in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subject design, oxytocin (24 iu) or a placebo was administered to 104 healthy volunteers. participants returned to complete the visual search paradigm 45min later. results showed that angry faces were detected more efficiently than happy faces. participants also gazed longer and more frequently toward angry faces. oxytocin did not, however, influence response time, accuracy, or gaze toward angry or happy faces, even when participants were separated into high- and low-social anxiety. the results of this study suggest that oxytocin may not influence the detection of positive and threatening social stimuli at early perceptual levels of processing. oxytocin may have greater influence in altering the cognitive processing of social valence at more conceptual and elaborate levels of processing.
risk profiling of hookworm infection and intensity in southern lao people’s democratic republic using bayesian models although ancylostoma ceylanicum is known to be an endemic and widely distributed hookworm of dogs and cats in asia, its contribution to human morbidity as a potentially zoonotic hookworm remains largely unexplored. since its discovery by lane (1913) as a 'new parasite' of humans a century ago, the hookworm has been regarded as a 'rare' and 'abnormal' parasite and largely overlooked in surveys of human parasites. recent molecular-based surveys in asia, however, have demonstrated that a. ceylanicum is the second most common hookworm species infecting humans, comprising between 6% and 23% of total patent hookworm infections. in experimentally induced infections, a. ceylanicum mimics the clinical picture produced by the anthroponotic hookworms of 'ground itch' and moderate to severe abdominal pain in the acute phase. natural infections with a. ceylanicum in humans have been reported in almost all geographical areas in which the hookworm is known to be endemic in dogs and cats, however for the majority of reports, no clinical data are available. much like the anthroponotic hookworm species, patent a. ceylanicum adults can isolate within the jejunum to produce chronic infections that on occasion, may occur in high enough burdens to produce anaemia. in addition, the hookworm can act much like ancylostoma caninum and be found lower in the gastrointestinal tract leading to abdominal distension and pain, diarrhoea and occult blood in the faeces accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia. whether a. ceylanicum is capable of producing both classical hookworm disease and evoking morbidity through an uncontrolled allergic response in some individuals remains unascertained. future investigations combining the use of molecular diagnostic tools with clinical and pathological data will shed further light on its role as a human pathogen. the control of this zoonosis necessitates an integrated and inter-sectorial "one health" approach be adopted in communities where large numbers of dogs share a close relationship with humans.
a population level computational model of the basal ganglia that generates parkinsonian local field potential activity a coherent set of models is presented that provide novel and testable predictions about the functional role of the subthalamic nucleus (stn) in the basal ganglia. the stn is emerging as an important target for novel therapeutic strategies for the alleviation of parkinsonian type symptoms [lancet 345 (1995) 91; science 249 (1990) 1436]. computational and mathematical models based on the properties of the stn and its interactions are reviewed. these models focus on core anatomical and physiological data that span many levels. by assessing models of anatomy, dynamic network models, and a detailed model of a recent pharmacological experiment, we can expose the primary modes of stn function and highlight their underlying properties. we show that the presence of functional interactions between stn projection neurons is critical in defining its behaviour and how it interacts with other basal ganglia nuclei. pulses or switch-like activity patterns emerge in the models as a consequence of these local interactions. furthermore, the models demonstrate that this behaviour can break down under abnormal conditions resulting in low frequency bursting oscillations. such oscillations may play a role in symptoms of parkinson's disease.
nonlinear chemical dynamics and synchronization while living systems have developed highly efficient ways to convert chemical energy (e.g., atp hydrolysis) to mechanical motion (e.g., movement of muscle), it remains a challenge to build muscle-like biomimetic systems to generate mechanical force directly from chemical reactions. here we show that a continuous flow of reactant solution leads to by far the largest volume change to date in autonomous active gels driven by the belousov-zhabotinsky reaction. these results demonstrate that microfluidics offers a useful and facile experimental approach to optimize the conditions (e.g., fabrication methods, counterions, flow rates, concentrations of reagents) for chemomechanical transduction in active materials. this work thus provides much needed insights and methods for the development of chemomechanically active systems based on combining soft materials and microfluidic systems.
aerial collective systems the use of digital pheromones for controlling and coordinating swarms of unmanned vehicles is studied under various conditions to determine their effectiveness in multiple military scenarios. the study demonstrates the effectiveness of these pheromone algorithms for surveillance, target acquisition, and tracking. the algorithms were demonstrated on hardware platforms and the results from the demonstration are reported
a study of k-means-based algorithms for constrained clustering while methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. this article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced cd (critical difference) diagrams.
type i interferons regulate susceptibility to inflammation-induced preterm birth. inflammation plays a central pathogenic role in the pernicious metabolic and end‐organ sequelae of obesity. among these sequelae, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) has become the most common chronic liver disease in the developed world. the twinned observations that obesity is associated with increased activation of the interleukin (il)‐17 axis and that this axis can regulate liver damage in diverse contexts prompted us to address the role of il‐17ra signaling in the progression of nafld. we further examined whether microbe‐driven il‐17a regulated nafld development and progression. we show here that il‐17ra−/− mice respond to high‐fat diet stress with significantly greater weight gain, visceral adiposity, and hepatic steatosis than wild‐type controls. however, obesity‐driven lipid accumulation was uncoupled from its end‐organ consequences in il‐17ra−/− mice, which exhibited decreased steatohepatitis, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph)‐oxidase enzyme expression, and hepatocellular damage. neutralization of il‐17a significantly reduced obesity‐driven hepatocellular damage in wild‐type mice. further, colonization of mice with segmented filamentous bacteria (sfb), a commensal that induces il‐17a production, exacerbated obesity‐induced hepatocellular damage. in contrast, sfb depletion protected from obesity‐induced hepatocellular damage. conclusion: these data indicate that obesity‐driven activation of the il‐17 axis is central to the development and progression of nafld to steatohepatitis and identify the il‐17 pathway as a novel therapeutic target in this condition.

an intracellular ammonium transporter is necessary for replication, differentiation, and resistance to starvation and osmotic stress in trypanosoma cruzi abstract trypanosoma cruzi is the agent of chagas disease, and the finding that this parasite possesses a mitochondrial calcium uniporter (tcmcu) with characteristics similar to that of mammalian mitochondria was fundamental for the discovery of the molecular nature of mcu in eukaryotes. we report here that ablation of tcmcu, or its paralog tcmcub, by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr)/cas9 led to a marked decrease in mitochondrial ca2+ uptake without affecting the membrane potential of these cells, whereas overexpression of each gene caused a significant increase in the ability of mitochondria to accumulate ca2+. while tcmcu-knockout (ko) epimastigotes were viable and able to differentiate into trypomastigotes, infect host cells, and replicate normally, ablation of tcmcub resulted in epimastigotes having an important growth defect, lower rates of respiration and metacyclogenesis, more pronounced autophagy changes under starvation, and significantly reduced infectivity. overexpression of tcmcub, in contrast to what was proposed for its mammalian ortholog, did not result in a dominant negative effect on tcmcu. importance the finding of a mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mcu) in trypanosoma cruzi was essential for the discovery of the molecular nature of this transporter in mammals. in this work, we used the crispr/cas9 technique that we recently developed for t. cruzi to knock out two components of the uniporter: mcu, the pore subunit, and mcub, which was proposed as a negative regulator of mcu in human cells. in contrast to what occurs in human cells, mcu is not essential, while mcub is essential for growth, differentiation, and infectivity; has a bioenergetic role; and does not act as a dominant negative subunit of mcu. the finding of a mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mcu) in trypanosoma cruzi was essential for the discovery of the molecular nature of this transporter in mammals. in this work, we used the crispr/cas9 technique that we recently developed for t. cruzi to knock out two components of the uniporter: mcu, the pore subunit, and mcub, which was proposed as a negative regulator of mcu in human cells. in contrast to what occurs in human cells, mcu is not essential, while mcub is essential for growth, differentiation, and infectivity; has a bioenergetic role; and does not act as a dominant negative subunit of mcu.
transfusion-related acute lung injury in the critically ill: prospective nested case-control study. the objective of this study was to refine the apache (acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation) methodology in order to more accurately predict hospital mortality risk for critically ill hospitalized adults. we prospectively collected data on 17,440 unselected adult medical/surgical intensive care unit (icu) admissions at 40 us hospitals (14 volunteer tertiary-care institutions and 26 hospitals randomly chosen to represent intensive care services nationwide). we analyzed the relationship between the patient's likelihood of surviving to hospital discharge and the following predictive variables: major medical and surgical disease categories, acute physiologic abnormalities, age, preexisting functional limitations, major comorbidities, and treatment location immediately prior to icu admission. the apache iii prognostic system consists of two options: (1) an apache iii score, which can provide initial risk stratification for severely ill hospitalized patients within independently defined patient groups; and (2) an apache iii predictive equation, which uses apache iii score and reference data on major disease categories and treatment location immediately prior to icu admission to provide risk estimates for hospital mortality for individual icu patients. a five-point increase in apache iii score (range, 0 to 299) is independently associated with a statistically significant increase in the relative risk of hospital death (odds ratio, 1.10 to 1.78) within each of 78 major medical and surgical disease categories. the overall predictive accuracy of the first-day apache iii equation was such that, within 24 h of icu admission, 95 percent of icu admissions could be given a risk estimate for hospital death that was within 3 percent of that actually observed (r2 = 0.41; receiver operating characteristic = 0.90). recording changes in the apache iii score on each subsequent day of icu therapy provided daily updates in these risk estimates. when applied across the individual icus, the first-day apache iii equation accounted for the majority of variation in observed death rates (r2 = 0.90, p less than 0.0001).
narrow band imaging versus white-light: what is best for computer-assisted diagnosis of celiac disease? automated classification of duodenal texture patches with histological ground truth in case of pediatric celiac disease is proposed. the classical focus of classification in this context is a two-class problem: mucosa affected by celiac disease and unaffected duodenal tissue. we extend this focus and apply classification according to a modified marsh scheme into four classes. in addition to other techniques used previously for classification of endoscopic imagery, we apply local binary pattern (lbp) operators and propose two new operator types, one of which adapts to the different properties of wavelet transform subbands. the achieved results are promising in that operators based on lbp turn out to achieve better results compared to many other texture classification techniques as used in earlier work. specifically, the proposed wavelet-based lbp scheme achieved the best overall accuracy of all feature extraction techniques considered in the two-class case and was among the best in the four-class scheme. results also show that a classification into four classes is feasible in principle however when compared to the two-class case we note that there is still room for improvement due to various reasons discussed.
statistical and biological gene-lifestyle interactions of mc4r and fto with diet and physical activity on obesity: new effects on alcohol consumption background the search for interaction effects is common in epidemiological studies, but the power of such studies is a major concern. this is a practical issue as many future studies will wish to investigate potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions and therefore need to be planned on the basis of appropriate sample size calculations.   methods the underlying model considered in this paper is a simple linear regression and relating a continuous outcome to a continuously distributed exposure variable.   results the slope of the regression line is taken to be dependent on genotype, and the ratio of the slopes for each genotype is considered as the interaction parameter. sample size is affected by the allele frequency and whether the genetic model is dominant or recessive. it is also critically dependent upon the size of the association between exposure and outcome, and the strength of the interaction term. the link between these determinants is graphically displayed to allow sample size and power to be estimated. an example of the analysis of the association between physical activity and glucose intolerance demonstrates how information from previous studies can be used to determine the sample size required to examine gene-environment interactions.   conclusions the formulae allowing the computation of the sample size required to study the interaction between a continuous environmental exposure and a genetic factor on a continuous outcome variable should have a practical utility in assisting the design of studies of appropriate power.
does targeted pre‐load optimisation by stroke volume variation attenuate a reduction in cardiac output in the prone position multiple t‐tests (or their non‐parametric equivalents) are often used erroneously to compare the means of three or more groups in anaesthetic research. methods for correcting the p value regarded as significant can be applied to take account of multiple testing, but these are somewhat arbitrary and do not avoid several unwieldy calculations. the appropriate method for most such comparisons is the ‘analysis of variance’ that not only economises on the number of statistical procedures, but also indicates if underlying factors or sub‐groups have contributed to any significant results. this article outlines the history, rationale and method of this analysis.
the spatial extent of the bold response functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify the effects of changes in spatial and featural attention on brain activity in the middle temporal visual area and associated motion processing regions (hmt+) of normal human subjects. when subjects performed a discrimination task that directed their spatial attention to a peripherally presented annulus and their featural attention to the speed of points in the annulus, activity in hmt+ was maximal. if subjects were instead asked to discriminate the color of points in the annulus, the magnitude and volume of activation in hmt+ fell to 64 and 35%, respectively, of the previously observed maximum response. in another experiment, subjects were asked to direct their spatial attention away from the annulus toward the fixation point to detect a subtle change in luminance. the response magnitude and volume dropped to 40 and 9% of maximum. these experiments demonstrate that both spatial and featural attention modulate hmt+ and that their effects can work in concert to modulate cortical activity. the high degree of modulation by attention suggests that an understanding of the stimulus-driven properties of visual cortex needs to be complemented with an investigation of the effects of task-related factors on visual processing.
troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate injection protects neurovascular units from oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation-induced injury in vitro a novel triple cell neurovascular unit (nvu) model co-culturing with neurons, brain microvascular endothelial cells (bmecs) and astrocytes was established in this study for investigating the cerebral diseases and screening the candidates of therapeutic drug. we have first performed the cell identification and morphological characterization, analyzed the specific protein expression and determined the blood-brain barrier (bbb) function of the co-culture model under normal condition. then, we further determined the bbb function, inflammation, cell injury and the variation of neuroprotective factor in this model after anoxia-reoxygenation. the results suggest that this model exhibited a better bbb function and significantly increased expression of p-glycoprotein (pg-p) and zo-1 compared with bmecs only or co-culture with astrocytes or neurons. after anoxia-reoxygenation, the pathological changes of this model were basically resemblance to the pathological changes of brain cells and bbb in vivo. and nimodipine, an antagonist of calcium, could reverse those changes as well. according to our observations, we deduce that this triple cell co-culture model exhibits the basic structure, function and cell-cell interaction of nvu, which may offer a more proper in vitro system of nvu for the further investigation of cerebral diseases and drug screening.
extracellular matrix molecules and cell adhesion molecules induce neurites through different mechanisms n-cadherin is the predominant mediator of calcium-dependent adhesion in the nervous system (takeichi, m. 1988. development (camb.). 102: 639- 655). investigations using antibodies to block n-cadherin function (bixby, j.l., r.l. pratt, j. lilien, and l.f. reichardt. 1987. proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 84:2555-2569; bixby, j.l., j. lilien, and l.f. reichardt. 1988. j. cell biol. 107:353-362; tomaselli, k.j., k.n. neugebauer, j.l. bixby, j. lilien, and l.f. reichardt. 1988. neuron. 1:33-43) or transfection of the n-cadherin gene into heterologous cell lines (matsunaga, m., k. hatta, a. nagafuchi, and m. takeichi. 1988. nature (lond.). 334:62-64) have provided evidence that n-cadherin, alone or in combination with other molecules, can participate in the induction of neurite extension. we have developed an affinity purification procedure for the isolation of whole n-cadherin from chick brain and have used the isolated protein as a substrate for neurite outgrowth. n-cadherin promotes the rapid extension of neurites from chick ciliary ganglion neurons, which extend few or no neurites on adhesive but noninducing substrates such as polylysine, tissue culture plastic, and collagens. n-cadherin is extremely potent, more so than the l1 adhesion molecule, and comparable to the extracellular matrix protein laminin. compared to laminin, however. n-cadherin promotes outgrowth from ciliary ganglion neurons extremely rapidly and with a distinct morphology. these results provide a direct demonstration that n-cadherin is sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth when substrate bound and suggest that the mechanism(s) involved may differ from that induced by laminin.
intra-group relatedness affects parental and helper investment rules in offspring care in cooperatively breeding species, parents often use helper contributions to offspring care to cut their own costs of investment (i.e. load-lightening). understanding the process of load-lightening is essential to understanding both the rules governing parental investment and the adaptive value of helping behaviour, but little experimental work has been conducted. here we report the results of field experiments to determine maternal provisioning rules in cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens (malurus cyaneus). by manipulating carer : offspring ratios, we demonstrate that helpers allow females to reduce the rate at which they provision their brood. female reductions, however, were less than that provided by helpers, so that chicks still received food at a faster rate in the presence of helpers. despite this, chicks fed by parents and helpers were not heavier than those provisioned by parents alone. this is because maternal load-lightening not only occurs during the chick provisioning stage, but also at the egg investment stage. theoretically, complete load-lightening is predicted when parents value themselves more highly than their offspring. we tested this idea by ‘presenting’ mothers with a ‘choice’ between reducing their own levels of care and increasing investment in their offspring. we found that mothers preferred to cut their contributions to brood care, just as predicted. our experiments help to explain why helper effects on offspring success have been difficult to detect in superb fairy-wrens, and suggest that the accuracy with which theoretical predictions of parental provisioning rules are matched in cooperative birds depends on measuring maternal responses to helper presence at both the egg and chick stages.
cost-effectiveness analysis of zinc supplementation for treatment of acute diarrhea in children younger than 5 years in colombia background zinc deficiency is prevalent in children in developing countries. supplemental zinc provides therapeutic benefits in diarrhea.   objective we sought to measure the effect of supplemental zinc given with oral rehydration therapy during recovery from acute or persistent diarrhea.   design we conducted pooled analyses including all available published and unpublished randomized controlled trials of the effects of supplementary oral zinc in children aged <5 y with acute or persistent diarrhea. we used cox survival regression analysis to evaluate the overall effect of zinc on continuation of diarrhea and possible differential effects in subgroups divided by sex, age, weight-for-height, and initial plasma zinc concentration. dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by logistic regression. to assess the effects of excluding studies without original data from the pooled analyses, effect-size was estimated for all studies by using random-effects models.   results zinc-supplemented children had a 15% lower probability of continuing diarrhea on a given day (95% ci: 5%, 24%) in the acute-diarrhea trials and a 24% lower probability of continuing diarrhea (95% ci: 9%, 37%) and a 42% lower rate of treatment failure or death (95% ci: 10%, 63%) in the persistent-diarrhea trials. in none of the subgroup analyses were the 2 subgroups of each pair significantly different from each other; however, in persistent diarrhea there tended to be a greater effect in subjects aged <12 mo, who were male, or who had wasting or lower baseline plasma zinc concentrations.   conclusion zinc supplementation reduces the duration and severity of acute and persistent diarrhea.
erythroid progenitor cells expanded from peripheral blood without mobilization or preselection: molecular characteristics and functional competence we describe a new two-step culture method for mass production in vitro of erythroid cells from either cd34+ (10(5) cells/ml) or light-density (10(6) cells/ml) cells purified from the blood of normal donors and thalassemic patients. the method includes (i) culture of the cells in the presence of dexamethasone and estradiol (10(-6) m each) and (ii) the growth factors scf (50 ng/ml), il-3 (1 ng/ml), and epo (1 u/ml). in their proliferative phase, these cultures generated approximately 1.2 x 10(7) erythroblasts for each milliliter of blood collected from normal donors or thalassemic patients. they were composed mostly (90%) of cd45(low)/glycophorin (gpa)(neg)/cd71(1ow) cells at day 7, 50-60\% of which became cd45(neg)/gpa+/cd71high by days 15-20. however, when cells from days 7 to 12 of the proliferative phase were transferred in differentiation medium containing epo and insulin, they progressed to mature erythroblasts (g90% benzidine(pos) and cd45(neg)/gpa+/cd71medium) in 4 days. because of the high number of erythroid cells that are generated from modest volumes of blood, this method will prove useful in donor-specific studies of erythroid differentiation.
analytical study on improving lookup performance of distributed hash table systems under churn we describe a peer-to-peer distributed hash table with provable consistency and performance in a fault-prone environment. our system routes queries and locates nodes using a novel xor-based metric topology that simplifies the algorithm and facilitates our proof. the topology has the property that every message exchanged conveys or reinforces useful contact information. the system exploits this information to send parallel, asynchronous query messages that tolerate node failures without imposing timeout delays on users.

mechanistic insight into prolonged electromechanical delay in dyssynchronous heart failure: a computational study. cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt) is an established clinical treatment modality that aims to recoordinate contraction of the heart in dyssynchrous heart failure (dhf) patients. although crt reduces morbidity and mortality, a significant percentage of crt patients fail to respond to the therapy, reflecting an insufficient understanding of the electromechanical activity of the dhf heart. computational models of ventricular electromechanics are now poised to fill this knowledge gap and provide a comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal electromechanical interactions in the normal and dhf heart. the objective of this paper is to demonstrate the powerful utility of computational models of ventricular electromechanics in characterizing the relationship between the electrical and mechanical activation in the dhf heart, and how this understanding can be utilized to devise better crt strategies. the computational research presented here exploits knowledge regarding the three dimensional distribution of the electromechanical delay, defined as the time interval between myocyte depolarization and onset of myofiber shortening, in determining the optimal location of the lv pacing electrode for crt. the simulation results shown here also suggest utilizing myocardial efficiency and regional energy consumption as a guide to optimize crt.
convex optimization and utility theory, new trends in vlsi circuit layout the "quadratic placement" methodology is rooted in [module placement based on resistive network optimization, proud: a sea-of-gate placement algorithm, a combined force and cut algorithm for hierarchical vlsi layout]and is reputedly used in many commercial and in-house tools forplacement of standard-cell and gate-array designs. the methodologyiterates between two basic steps: solving sparse systems oflinear equations, and repartitioning. this work dissects the implementationand motivations for quadratic placement. we firstshow that (i) krylov subspace engines for solving sparse systemsof linear equations are more effective than the traditional successiveover-relaxation (sor) engine [a unified approach to partitioning and placement] and (ii) order convergence criteriacan maintain solution quality while using substantially fewersolver iterations. we then discuss the motivations and relevanceof the quadratic placement approach, in the context of past and futurealgorithmic technology, performance requirements, and designmethodology. we provide evidence that the use of numerical linearsystems solvers with quadratic wirelength objective may be due tothe pre-1990's weakness of min-cut partitioners, i.e., numerical engineswere needed to provide helpful hints to min-cut partitioners.finally, we note emerging methodology drivers in deep-submicrondesign that may require new placement approaches to the placement problem.
flumazenil attenuates development of tolerance to diazepam after chronic treatment of mice with either isoflurane or diazepam we examined in mice the effect of chronic diazepam treatment on the sensitivity to isoflurane, and that of repeated isoflurane exposure on the sensitivity to diazepam. mice were divided into four groups: group 1, treated with diazepam, 10 mg/kg i.p. twice daily; group 2, vehicle-treated controls; group 3, exposed to 3% isoflurane for 25 min twice daily; and group 4, untreated controls. after 14 days the effect of the treatment was assessed. twenty-four hours after the last 10 mg/kg diazepam treatment, groups 1 and 2 received diazepam, 5 mg/kg i.p., and were subjected to the horizontal wire test (hwt). all control mice but only 10% of the diazepam-treated mice failed the hwt. groups 1 and 2 were then exposed to increasing concentrations of isoflurane. diazepam-treated mice (group 1) lost the hwt at 0.7+/-0.7%, compared with 0.6+/-0.1% in controls (group 2) (p<0.001); the ed50 was 0.75% vs. 0.65%. group 1 mice lost the righting reflex at 0.94+/-0.07% isoflurane vs. 0.87+/-0.06% in group 2 (p<0.01); the ed50 was 0.93% vs. 0.82%. recovery time was 175+/-161 s in group 1 vs. 343+/-275 s in group 2 (p<0.02). twenty-four hours after the last of the repeated exposures to isoflurane, we examined the responses of groups 3 and 4 to increasing concentrations of isoflurane. mice in group 3 lost the righting reflex at 1.0+/-0.06% isoflurane vs. 0.9+/-0.04% in controls (group 4) (p<0.001); the ed50 was 0.96% vs. 0.85%. recovery time was 113+/-124 s vs. 208+/-126 s in groups 3 and 4 (p<0.09). diazepam, 3 mg/kg i.p. administered to groups 3 and 4, caused loss of the hwt reflex in 33% of group 3 mice and in 82% of controls (group 4) (p<0.001). it appears that prolonged exposure to both diazepam and isoflurane caused reduced sensitivity to each drug separately, as well as to the other drug. this finding may strengthen the theory that inhalational anesthetics may act via the same mechanism as the benzodiazepines.
linked metabolites: a tool for the construction of directed metabolic graphs we introduce and discuss a new computational approach towards prediction and inference of biological functions from genomic sequences by making use of the pathway data in kegg. due to its piecewise nature, the current approach of predicting each gene function based on sequence similarity searches often fails to reconstruct cellular functions with all necessary components. the pathway diagram in kegg, which may be considered a wiring diagram of molecules in biological systems, can be utilised as a reference for functional reconstruction. kegg also contains binary relations that represent molecular interactions and relations and that can be utilised for computing and comparing pathways.
a teacher-student framework for zero-resource neural machine translation human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused. we propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. we present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.
a novel speckle analysis scheme for coherence measurement using a standard phase modulator the measurement of the spectral broadening, or temporal coherence property of very narrow linewidth lasers is not an easy task, while such a measurement is essential in any interferometric applications of the lasers. the beat note between two assumingly identical lasers only provides the convolutional spectral profile of the two lasers, but not characterizes the single laser. the delayed self-heterodyne interferometer (dshi) would not be effective for khz linewidth range because the finite delay cannot realize complete de-correlation. here, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, the complete characterization of the modulus of the degree of coherence (doc) of khz linewidth lasers, with a self-referenced fashion where any other reference beam is not used, accordingly, characterize the spectral profile. the method is based on speckle statistical analysis of the rayleigh scattering in the coherent fiber reflectometry, and would be a novel strong tool to characterize very narrow linewidth lasers.
successful desensitization with proteasome inhibition and costimulation blockade in sensitized nonhuman primates. we have established a model of sensitization in nonhuman primates and tested two immunosuppressive regimens. animals underwent fully mismatched skin transplantation, and donor‐specific antibody (dsa) response was monitored by flow cross‐match. sensitized animals subsequently underwent kidney transplantation from their skin donor. immunosuppression included tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and methylprednisolone. three animals received basiliximab induction; compared with nonsensitized animals, they showed a shorter mean survival time (4.7 ± 3.1 vs. 187 ± 88 days). six animals were treated with t cell depletion (anti‐cd4/cd8 mabs), which prolonged survival (mean survival time 21.6 ± 19.0 days). all presensitized animals showed antibody‐mediated rejection (amr). in two of three basiliximab‐injected animals, cellular rejection (acr) was prominent. after t cell depletion, three of six monkeys experienced early acute rejection within 8 days with histological evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy and amr. the remaining three monkeys survived 27–44 days, with mixed amr and acr. most t cell–depleted animals experienced a rebound of dsa that correlated with deteriorating kidney function. we also found an increase in proliferating memory b cells (cd20+cd27+igd−ki67+), lymph node follicular helper t cells (icos+pd‐1hicxcr5+cd4+), and germinal center (gc) response. depletion controlled cell‐mediated rejection in sensitized nonhuman primates better than basiliximab, yet grafts were rejected with concomitant dsa rise. this model provides an opportunity to test novel desensitization strategies.
late preconditioning against stunning is not mediated by increased antioxidant defenses in conscious pigs. abstract a method for measurement of both oxidized (gssg) and reduced (gsh) glutathione has been developed, with use of o -phthalaldehyde (opt) as a fluorescent reagent. the method takes advantage of the reaction of gsh with opt at ph 8 and of gssg with opt at ph 12; gsh can be complexed to n -ethylmaleimide to prevent interference of gsh with measurement of gssg. the method gave “recoveries” of 91 to 110% for both gsh and gssg and was quite specific for glutathione; and none of the manipulations appeared to influence the amount of glutathione present in the tissue. results for gsh levels agreed well with earlier reports but levels of gssg estimated here were higher than earlier reported values. the reasons for the apparently higher levels of gssg are discussed.

reduced cytochrome p4501a activity and recovery from oxidative stress during subchronic benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[e]pyrene treatment of rainbow trout. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are ubiquitous, environmental contaminants that pose a potential risk to fish populations. both field and laboratory studies suggest that exposure of the early life stages of fish to pah can mimic the embryotoxic effects of the planar halogenated hydrocarbons (phhs), the most potent of which is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. phh toxicity is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) and phh potency is predicted by its ahr-binding affinity and cyp1a induction potency. however, the role of the ahr, if any, in mediating the developmental effects of pah to fish remains unknown. in this study we looked at the ahr binding affinity of a test set of pah that had been previously ranked for their potency for inducing teleost cyp1a. pah that induced cyp1a inhibited [3h]tcdd binding to in vitro-expressed ahrs from rainbow trout and the ahr expressed in plhc-1 fish hepatoma cells. generally, the relative rank order for ahr binding affinity predicted the rank order of these same pah for inducing cyp1a reported in other studies. there was a strong, positive relationship between binding to the plhc-1 ahr (stimulus) and the ec50s for cyp1a induction (response) in whole juvenile trout and in rtl-w1 cells, but ec50s were much higher than expected for a 1:1 stimulus/response relationship. these data show that the ability of pah to bind to teleost ahr predicts pah potency for cyp1a induction. if pah toxicity is receptor-mediated and predicted by induction potencies, we will have a powerful mechanistic-based tool for rapidly assessing the risk of toxicity to fish of pah from any source.
the interaction between pubertal timing and peer popularity for boys and girls: an integration of biological and interpersonal perspectives on adolescent depression a sample of 198 african american families, living in urban poverty, participated in a longitudinal study of adolescent sexual development beginning when children were in the 4th or 5th grade. self-reports of family conflict and pubertal development and videotaped family interaction data were collected at 2 time points approximately 2 years apart. youths reported on sexual debut at each time point. more boys than girls reached sexual debut early. greater levels of family conflict predicted early sexual debut. observational data indicated more developed preadolescents with greater family conflict and less positive affect were least likely to delay debut. changes in pubertal development and observed family conflict were associated with early debut. possible mediating mechanisms and implications for preventive interventions are discussed.
corticosteroid after etomidate in critically ill patients: a randomized controlled trial* objectiveto determine the incidence and duration of adrenal inhibition induced by a single dose of etomidate in critically ill patients.designprospective, observational cohort study.settingthree intensive care units in a university hospital.patientsforty critically ill patients without sepsis who received a single dose of etomidate for facilitating endotracheal intubation.measurements and main resultsserial serum cortisol and 11β-deoxycortisol samples were taken at baseline and 60 min after corticotropin stimulation test (250 μg 1–24 acth) at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after etomidate administration. etomidate-related adrenal inhibition was defined by the combination of a rise in cortisol less than 250 nmol/l (9 μg/dl) after acth stimulation and an excessive accumulation of serum 11β-deoxycortisol concentrations at baseline. at 12 h after etomidate administration, 32/40 (80%) patients fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for etomidate-related adrenal insufficiency. this incidence was significantly lower at 48 h (9%) and 72 h (7%). the cortisol to 11β-deoxycortisol ratio (f/s ratio), reflecting the intensity of the 11β-hydroxylase enzyme blockade, improved significantly over time.conclusionsa single bolus infusion of etomidate resulted in wide adrenal inhibition in critically ill patients. however, this alteration was reversible by 48 h following the drug administration. the empirical use of steroid supplementation for 48 h following a single dose of etomidate in icu patients without septic shock should thus be considered. concomitant serum cortisol and 11β-deoxycortisol dosages are needed to provide evidence for adrenal insufficiency induced by etomidate in critically ill patients.
multiple anti-interferon actions of the influenza a virus ns1 protein the nonstructural protein ns1 of influenza virus is an antagonist of host immune responses and is implicated in virulence. it has two domains, an n-terminal double-stranded rna–binding domain (rbd) and an effector domain crucial for rbd function, for nuclear export and for sequestering messenger rna–processing proteins. here we present the crystallographic structure of the effector domain, which has a novel fold and suggests mechanisms for increased virulence in h5n1 strains.
secondary structure across the bacterial transcriptome reveals versatile roles in mrna regulation and function we have mapped and quantified mouse transcriptomes by deeply sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is represented in the sequence sample (rna-seq). this provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. we report reference measurements composed of 41–52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(a)-selected rna from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. we used rna standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. although >90% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3′ untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microrna precursors. rna splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. we observed 1.45 × 105 distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.

dynamic irregular octrees an algorithm is described that speeds up ray-tracing techniques by reducing the number of time-consuming object-ray intersection calculations that have to be made. the algorithm is based on subdividing space into an octree, associating a given voxel with only those objects whose surfaces pass through the volume of the voxel. it includes a technique for obtaining fast access to any node and a mechanism for finding the next node intersected by a ray when it has hit nothing in the current node. this new algorithm makes possible the ray tracing of complex scenes by medium-scale and small-scale computers.
a computational comparison of symmetry handling methods for mixed integer programs constraint integer programming (cip) is a novel paradigm which integrates constraint programming (cp), mixed integer programming (mip), and satisfiability (sat) modeling and solving techniques. in this paper we discuss the software framework and solver scip (solving constraint integer programs), which is free for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code. this paper gives an overview of the main design concepts of scip and how it can be used to solve constraint integer programs. to illustrate the performance and flexibility of scip, we apply it to two different problem classes. first, we consider mixed integer programming and show by computational experiments that scip is almost competitive to specialized commercial mip solvers, even though scip supports the more general constraint integer programming paradigm. we develop new ingredients that improve current mip solving technology. as a second application, we employ scip to solve chip design verification problems as they arise in the logic design of integrated circuits. this application goes far beyond traditional mip solving, as it includes several highly non-linear constraints, which can be handled nicely within the constraint integer programming framework. we show anecdotally how the different solving techniques from mip, cp, and sat work together inside scip to deal with such constraint classes. finally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for proving the validity of properties on circuits containing arithmetic.
modeling, simulation, and kinetic analysis of a heterogeneous reaction system for the enzymatic conversion of poorly soluble substrate. d-hydantoinase is an industrial enzyme widely used for the synthesis of optically active d-amino acids. a gene encoding thermostable d-hydantoinase of bacillus stearothermophilus sd-1 has previously been cloned and constitutively expressed by its native promoter in escherichia coli xl1-blue (lee et al., 1996b). in this work, we attempted mass production of the d-hydantoinase by batch culture of the recombinant e. coli using glycerol as a carbon source. the plasmid content in cells increased in proportion to the culture temperature, which resulted in a two- or three-fold increase of the specific d-hydantoinase activity at 37 degrees c compared with that at 30 degrees c. the plasmid was stably maintained over 80 generations. when glycerol was initially added to a concentration of 100 g/l, the final biomass concentration reached about 50 g-dry cell weight/l in a 50 l-scale fermentation, resulting in the specific enzyme production of 3.8 x 10(4) unit/g-dry cell weight in a soluble form. glycerol-using batch cultivation of recombinant e. coli was found to be a cost-effective process for the mass production of industrially useful d-hydantoinase.

deoxycholic acid (dca) causes ligand-independent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and fas receptor in primary hepatocytes: inhibition of egfr/mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling module enhances dca-induced apoptosis. in primary hepatocytes and hepg2 hepatoma cells, prolonged activation of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway is associated with a reduction in dna synthesis, mediated by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21 (cip-1/waf1/mda6) (p21). this study was performed to evaluate the contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in this response. prolonged activation of the mapk pathway in wild-type or p21 null hepatocytes caused a large decrease and increase, respectively, in dna synthesis. prolonged activation of the mapk pathway in either wild-type or p21 antisense hepg2 cells also caused large decreases and increases, respectively, in dna synthesis. mapk signaling increased the phosphorylation of the transcription factors ets2, c/ebpalpha, and c/ebpbeta, and rapidly increased transcription from the p21 promoter via multiple ets- and c/ebp-elements within the enhancer region. eight hours after mapk activation, loss of c/ebpbeta or ets2 function significantly reduced mapk-stimulated transcription from the p21 promoter and abolished increased p21 protein expression. at this time, mapk signaling increased both p21 mrna and p21 protein stabilities that were also demonstrated to be essential for a profound increase in p21 protein levels. thirty-six hours after mapk activation, transcription from the p21 promoter was still significantly reduced in cells without either c/ebpbeta or ets2 function; however, these cells were now capable of exhibiting a partial increase in p21 protein expression. in contrast, loss of c/ebpalpha function modestly reduced mapk-stimulated transcription from the p21 promoter but strongly inhibited the ability of prolonged mapk activation to increase protein levels of p21. this data suggested that prolonged enhancement of p21 protein levels may be under posttranscriptional control. in agreement with this hypothesis, prolonged mapk signaling further increased p21 mrna stability at 36 h, compared with the 8-h time point. our data argue that mapk signaling increased p21 promoter activity via multiple transcription factors, which alone were insufficient for a robust prolonged increase in p21 protein levels in primary hepatocytes, and that to increase p21 protein levels also required enhanced stabilization of p21 mrna and p21 protein. collectively, these data suggest that loss of transcription factor and mrna/protein stabilization functions correlates with an inability of mapk signaling to cause growth arrest versus proliferation in primary hepatocytes.
specific cell tropism and neutralization of human parechovirus types 1 and 3: implications for pathogenesis and therapy development. a cytopathic agent (a308/99) was isolated using vero cells from a stool specimen of a 1-year-old patient with transient paralysis. the agent was approximately 28 nm in diameter with a distinct ultrastructure resembling the virus particle of an enterovirus. it could not be neutralized by antisera against human picornaviruses such as human enterovirus, aichi virus or human parechovirus. the virion contained three capsid proteins with molecular masses of 38, 30.3 and 30 kda. determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of a308/99 revealed that the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were closely related to those of human parechoviruses. when 11 regions encoding the structural and non-structural proteins were compared, a308/99 had between 75 and 97 % and 73 and 97 % nucleotide identity with human parechovirus type 1 (hpev-1) and type 2 (hpev-2), respectively. the most distinctive divergence was seen in vp1, which had 74.5 % and 73.1 % nucleotide identity with hpev-1 and hpev-2, respectively. viruses related to a308/99 were also isolated from three patients with gastroenteritis, exanthema or respiratory illnesses. a308/99 and these other three isolates had no arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (rgd) motif, which is located near the c terminus of vp1 in hpev-1 and hpev-2. a seroepidemiological study revealed that the prevalence of a308/99 antibodies was low (15 %) among infants but became higher with age, reaching more than 80 % by 30 years of age. these observations indicate that a308/99 is genetically close to, but serologically and genetically distinct from, hpev-1 and hpev-2 and accordingly can be classified as third serotype of human parechovirus.
evolution, development and environment toward adaptation through phenotypic plasticity and exploitation of external information today’s reconfigurable technology provides vast parallelism that may be exploited in the design of a cellular computing machine (ccm). in this work a virtual sblock fpga is implemented on an existing fpga, achieving not only an architecture in keeping with cellular computing principles but also suited to biologically inspired design methods. the design method proposed is a combination of evolution and development and results of running a developmental model on the ccm are presented.
a healthy lifestyle index and its association with risk of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer among canadian women background in 2007 the world cancer research fund (wcrf) and the american institute of cancer research (aicr) issued 8 recommendations (plus 2 special recommendations) on diet, physical activity, and weight management for cancer prevention on the basis of the most comprehensive collection of available evidence.   objective we aimed to investigate whether concordance with the wcrf/aicr recommendations was related to cancer risk in the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (epic) study.   design the present study included 386,355 epic participants from 9 european countries. at recruitment, dietary, anthropometric, and lifestyle information was collected. a score was constructed based on the wcrf/aicr recommendations on weight management, physical activity, foods and drinks that promote weight gain, plant foods, animal foods, alcoholic drinks, and breastfeeding for women; the score range was 0-6 for men and 0-7 for women. higher scores indicated greater concordance with wcrf/aicr recommendations. the association between the score and cancer risk was estimated by using multivariable cox regression models.   results concordance with the score was significantly associated with decreased risk of cancer. a 1-point increment in the score was associated with a risk reduction of 5% (95% ci: 3%, 7%) for total cancer, 12% (95% ci: 9%, 16%) for colorectal cancer, and 16% (95% ci: 9%, 22%) for stomach cancer. significant associations were also observed for cancers of the breast, endometrium, lung, kidney, upper aerodigestive tract, liver, and esophagus but not for prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, and bladder cancers.   conclusion adherence to the wcrf/aicr recommendations for cancer prevention may lower the risk of developing most types of cancer.
evaluation of adherence and depression among patients on peritoneal dialysis. there is a need to assess the contribution of mood disorder, especially anxiety and depression, in order to understand the experience of suffering in the setting of medical practice. most physicians are aware of this aspect of the illness of their patients but many feel incompetent to provide the patient with reliable information. the hospital anxiety and depression scale, or hads, was designed to provide a simple yet reliable tool for use in medical practice. the term 'hospital' in its title suggests that it is only valid in such a setting but many studies conducted throughout the world have confirmed that it is valid when used in community settings and primary care medical practice. it should be emphasised that self-assessment scales are only valid for screening purposes; definitive diagnosis must rest on the process of clinical examination.
examination of sox2 in variable ocular conditions identifies a recurrent deletion in microphthalmia and lack of mutations in other phenotypes a submicroscopic deletion containing sox2 was identified at the 3q breakpoint in a child with t(3;11)(q26.3;p11.2) associated with bilateral anophthalmia. subsequent sox2 mutation analysis identified de novo truncating mutations of sox2 in 4 of 35 (11%) individuals with anophthalmia. both eyes were affected in all cases with an identified mutation.
the relationship between sustained attention, attentional selectivity, and capacity insufficient attention to tasks can result in slips of action as automatic, unintended action sequences are triggered inappropriately. such slips arise in part from deficits in sustained attention, which are particularly likely to happen following frontal lobe and white matter damage in traumatic brain injury (tbi). we present a reliable laboratory paradigm that elicits such slips of action and demonstrates high correlations between the severity of brain damage and relative-reported everyday attention failures in a group of 34 tbi patients. we also demonstrate significant correlations between self- and informant-reported everyday attentional failures and performance on this paradigm in a group of 75 normal controls. the paradigm (the sustained attention to response task-sart) involves the withholding of key presses to rare (one in nine) targets. performance on the sart correlates significantly with performance on tests of sustained attention, but not other types of attention, supporting the view that this is indeed a measure of sustained attention. we also show that errors (false presses) on the sart can be predicted by a significant shortening of reaction times in the immediately preceding responses, supporting the view that these errors are a result of 'drift' of controlled processing into automatic responding consequent on impaired sustained attention to task. we also report a highly significant correlation of -0.58 between sart performance and glasgow coma scale scores in the tbi group.
comparative effects of the short qt n588k mutation at 37 degrees c on herg k+ channel current during ventricular, purkinje fibre and atrial action potentials: an action potential clamp study. mutations in mink-related peptide 1 (mirp1), the product of the kcne2 gene, have been associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmia syndromes related to impaired repolarization. mirp1 interacts with a variety of ion-channel &agr;-subunits, dysfunction of which could account for arrhythmia syndromes; however, the observation of very low-level expression of mirp1 in ventricular tissue has led to doubts about its relevance. the specialized his-purkinje system plays a key role in cardiac electrophysiology and is an important contributor to ventricular arrhythmias related to abnormal repolarization. we examined the relative abundance of mirp1 in canine purkinje versus ventricular tissue and found much greater expression at both mrna and protein levels in purkinje tissue. thus, the cardiac purkinje system is a strong candidate to play a role in arrhythmic syndromes due to mirp1 abnormalities.
hepatic transcriptomic responses to tcdd in dioxin-sensitive and dioxin-resistant rats during the onset of toxicity. acute progressive feed restriction (apfr) represents a specific form of caloric restriction in which feed availability is increasingly curtailed over a period of a few days to a few weeks. it is often used for control animals in toxicological and pharmacological studies on compounds causing body weight loss to equalize weight changes between experimental and control groups and thereby, intuitively, to also set their metabolic states to the same phase. however, scientific justification for this procedure is lacking. in the present study, we analyzed by microarrays the impact on hepatic gene expression in rats of two apfr regimens that caused identical diminution of body weight (19%) but differed slightly in duration (4 vs. 10 days). in addition, white adipose tissue (wat) was also subjected to the transcriptomic analysis on day-4. the data revealed that the two regimens led to distinct patterns of differentially expressed genes in liver, albeit some major pathways of energy metabolism were similarly affected (particularly fatty acid and amino acid catabolism). the reason for the divergence appeared to be entrainment by the longer apfr protocol of peripheral oscillator genes, which resulted in derailment of circadian rhythms and consequent interaction of altered diurnal fluctuations with metabolic adjustments in gene expression activities. wat proved to be highly unresponsive to the 4-day apfr as only 17 mrna levels were influenced by the treatment. this study demonstrates that body weight is a poor proxy of metabolic state and that the customary protocols of feed restriction can lead to rhythm entrainment.
linking neuromodulated spike-timing dependent plasticity with the free-energy principle hebbian models of development and learning require both activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and a mechanism that induces competition between different synapses. one form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (stdp), depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. in modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. it has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. synapses modifiable by stdp compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.
benefits of a 12-week lifestyle modification program including diet and combined aerobic and resistance exercise on albuminuria in diabetic and non-diabetic japanese populations objective the metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and mortality. however, the association between microalbuminuria and the metabolic syndrome has not yet been reported in the general population in japan. therefore, we undertook a population-based study to examine the association between microalbuminuria and the metabolic syndrome in takahata, japan.   methods subjects of this cross-sectional study were individuals aged from 40 to 87 years old. the metabolic syndrome was defined according to the criteria of the adult treatment panel iii. microalbuminuria was defined as a urine albumin-creatinine ratio of 30 to 300 mg/g.   results a total of 2,321 subjects (mean age 64 years old) were entered into the final analysis. among them, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and microalbuminuria was 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. there was a significantly positive correlation between the number of components of the metabolic syndrome and the corresponding prevalence of microalbuminuria (p<0.001). in the subjects with metabolic syndrome compared with those without metabolic syndrome, the age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio of microalbuminuria was 1.99 (95% ci, 1.49-2.66). multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that high glucose, high blood pressure and obesity were independently associated with microalbuminuria.   conclusions our study revealed a strong relationship between microalbuminuria and the metabolic syndrome in the general population in japan. more comprehensive and intensive management of the metabolic syndrome at its early stage is important to prevent the progression of renal injury and cardiovascular complications.
impact of combination therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin on plasma adiponectin levels in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease: combination therapy and adiponectin our objective was to determine the relationships between levels of different dietary nutrients intake with circulating endothelial progenitor cells (epc) and vascular endothelial function in type ii diabetic patients. we studied the daily dietary nutrients intake, the numbers of circulating cd34(+)/kdr(+) epc and cd133(+)/kdr(+) epc and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (fmd) in 88 diabetic patients without prior cardiovascular diseases and 91 sex- and age-matched controls. compared with controls, diabetic patients had lower cd133(+)/kdr(+) epc count (48.3 +/- 5.2 vs. 84.6 +/- 7.6/microl, p < 0.001), cd34(+)/kdr(+) epc count (311 +/- 41 vs. 412 +/- 36/microl, p = 0.045), and fmd (2.54 +/- 0.37% vs. 5.46 +/- 0.47%, p < 0.001). after adjusted for age, sex, smoking history, body weight, hemoglobin a1c level, total calorie intake, other dietary vitamin intake, use of antihypertensives, and lipid lowering agents, a higher intake of thiamine was significantly associated with a higher level of circulating cd34(+)/kdr(+) epc (beta = 0.49, p = 0.028) and cd133(+)/kdr(+) epc (beta = 0.45, p = 0.037) in diabetic patients, but not in controls. furthermore, an increased intake of thiamine from 1st to 4th quartile in diabetic patients independently predicted an absolute increase in fmd by 1.29% (p = 0.026, relative increase = 63.5%). this study demonstrated that daily thiamine intake was positively correlated with the circulating number of epcs and fmd in patients with type ii diabetes, independent of other dietary nutrients intake.
reservoirs and radiocarbon: c-14 dating problems in myvatnssveit, northern iceland dating by the radiocarbon method is of primary importance for archaeological studies and on many sites bones are the only samples which can be dated1. the losses arising from the destruction of bones for dating purposes is not very important, whereas it is a pity to destroy clothes or wooden items associated with the civilization being studied. it is also more logical to use bones for dating an archaeological level than to use wood or artefacts, for example, which are not necessarily contemporary with the site occupation2. there are, however, frequent and often important errors in 14c bone measurements which arise chiefly because of the difficulty of eliminating completely the numerous pollutants during chemical treatment.
tristetraprolin expression by keratinocytes controls local and systemic inflammation. background correction is an important preprocessing step for microarray data that attempts to adjust the data for the ambient intensity surrounding each feature. the “normexp” method models the observed pixel intensities as the sum of 2 random variables, one normally distributed and the other exponentially distributed, representing background noise and signal, respectively. using a saddle-point approximation, ritchie and others (2007) found normexp to be the best background correction method for 2-color microarray data. this article develops the normexp method further by improving the estimation of the parameters. a complete mathematical development is given of the normexp model and the associated saddle-point approximation. some subtle numerical programming issues are solved which caused the original normexp method to fail occasionally when applied to unusual data sets. a practical and reliable algorithm is developed for exact maximum likelihood estimation (mle) using high-quality optimization software and using the saddle-point estimates as starting values. “mle” is shown to outperform heuristic estimators proposed by other authors, both in terms of estimation accuracy and in terms of performance on real data. the saddle-point approximation is an adequate replacement in most practical situations. the performance of normexp for assessing differential expression is improved by adding a small offset to the corrected intensities.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
lambda-terms of bounded unary height this work presents a class of methods by which one can translate, on a term-by-term basis, an asymptotic expansion of a function around a dominant singularity into a corresponding asymptotic expansion for the taylor coefficients of the function. this approach is based on contour integration using cauchy’s formula and hankel-like contours. it constitutes an alternative to either darboux’s method or tauberian theorems that appears to be well suited to combinatorial enumerations, and a few applications in this area are outlined.
active learning for structured probabilistic models with histogram approximation conditional random field (crfs) is a popular and effective approach to structured prediction. when the underlying structure does not have a small tree-width, maximum likelihood estimation (mle) is in general computationally hard. discriminative methods such as perceptron or max-margin markov networks circumvent this problem by requiring the map assignment only, which is often more tractable, either exactly or approximately with linear programming (lp) relaxations. in this paper, we propose an approximate learning method for mle of crfs. we leverage lp relaxations to find multiple diverse map solutions and use them to approximate the intractable partition function. the proposed approach is easy to parallelize, and yields competitive performance in test accuracies on several structured prediction tasks.
temperament and character dimensions of patients with adult separation anxiety disorder. little attention has been given to measuring symptoms of separation anxiety (sa) in adulthood. the development of an adult separation anxiety questionnaire (asa-27) is described and compared to a previously derived adult separation anxiety semistructured interview (asa-si). principal components analysis revealed a coherent construct of sa with high internal consistency (cronbach's alpha =.95) and sound test-retest reliability (r =.86; p <.001). a receiver operation characteristic (roc) analysis against the semistructured interview yielded a high area under the curve index (auc = 0.9) suggesting that the questionnaire is an adequate alternative measure of sa. results of this study support previous research suggesting that a construct of sa may be readily measured in adults.
chapter four clusters of interdependent routines: a horizontal perspective and its post-acquisition transfer implications through a six-year qualitative study of medical residents, we build theory about professional identity construction. we found that identity construction was triggered by work-identity integrity violations: an experienced mismatch between what physicians did and who they were. these violations were resolved through identity customization processes (enriching, patching, or splinting), which were part of interrelated identity and work learning cycles. implications of our findings (e.g., for member identification) for both theory and practice are discussed.
moderate intensity exercise training reverses functional aerobic impairment in hiv-infected individuals we attempted to measure cardiopulmonary effects, cd4 counts, and perceived sense of well-being in 25 individuals moderately to severely immunocompromised from hiv infection (mean entry cd4 count = 144.microliters-1) before and after a 24-wk program of exercise training. only six subjects completed the 24-wk program. all six showed evidence of a training effect. statistically significant improvements were seen in maximal oxygen consumption (vo2max), oxygen pulse, and minute ventilation. submaximal exercise performance improved significantly by 12 wk in the 10 individuals available for testing: decreases were seen in heart rate, rate pressure product, and rate of perceived exertion. white blood cell counts and t-lymphocyte subsets were stable at 12 and 24 wk in the subjects available for testing. high depression/anxiety scores on a mental health inventory (general health questionnaire) correlated with low cd4 counts. scores did not correlate with compliance with the exercise program. there was a trend (p < 0.10) for scores to improve over time among those individuals who attended > or = 80% of scheduled exercise sessions. we conclude that exercise training is feasible and beneficial for some hiv-infected individuals.
an imperceptible and robust audio watermarking algorithm this paper presents a secure, robust, and blind adaptive audio watermarking algorithm based on singular value decomposition (svd) in the discrete wavelet transform domain using synchronization code. in our algorithm, a watermark is embedded by applying a quantization-index-modulation process on the singular values in the svd of the wavelet domain blocks. the watermarked signal is perceptually similar to the original audio signal and gives high quality output. experimental results show that the hidden watermark data is robust to additive noise, resampling, low-pass filtering, requantization, mp3 compression, cropping, echo addition, and denoising. performance analysis of the proposed scheme shows low error probability rates. the data embedding rate of the proposed scheme is 45.9 bps. the proposed scheme has high payload and superior performance against mp3 compression compared to the earlier audio watermarking schemes.
allergen microarray indicates pooideae sensitization in brazilian grass pollen allergic patients background allergen-specific immunotherapy uses aqueous extracts of natural source materials as a basis for preparations to down regulate the allergic response. recombinant dna technology has enabled the cloning of many allergens, thus facilitating investigations aimed at improving efficacy and safety of immunotherapy.   objective to determine the effectiveness of a mixture of 5 recombinant grass pollen allergens in reducing symptoms and need for symptomatic medication in patients allergic to grass pollen.   methods a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subcutaneous injection immunotherapy was performed in subjects with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, with or without asthma. primary endpoint was a symptom medication score compiled from separate symptom and medication scores. secondary endpoints included a rhinitis quality of life questionnaire, conjunctival provocation, and specific antibody responses.   results the symptom medication score showed significant improvements in subjects receiving recombinant allergens as opposed to placebo, with reductions in both symptoms and medication usage. the rhinitis quality of life questionnaire revealed clinically relevant significant improvements in overall assessment and in 5 of 7 separate domains, and conjunctival provocation showed a clear trend in favor of active treatment. all treated subjects developed strong allergen-specific igg(1) and igg(4) antibody responses. some patients were not sensitized to ph l p 5 but nevertheless developed strong igg antibody responses to that allergen.   conclusion a recombinant allergen vaccine can be a effective and safe treatment to ameliorate symptoms of allergic rhinitis. the clinical benefit is associated with modification of the specific immune response with promotion of igg(4) and reduction of ige antibodies consistent with the induction of il-10-producing regulatory t cells.
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in the animal model: influence on liver surgery background and aim:  sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (sos) is drug‐induced liver injury that occurs in patients who receive hematopoietic cell transplantation and oxaliplatin‐contained chemotherapy. the aim of study was to investigate the pharmacological treatment of sos using a traditional japanese medicine, dai‐kenchu‐to (dkt).
modeling and exploiting collaborative traces in web-based collaborative working environment process oriented knowledge management (pkm) has been a widely discussed approach for km initiatives. the approach ties business strategy closely to km by connecting knowledge activities to key business processes. social software has been taken up in many domains as an organizational tool for managing knowledge. up till now, the impact of being globally distributed (organizations and teams) has not been emphasized within the pkm view, nor has been the social software approach. the globally distributed, social software â€“ supported approach has clear impacts for designing and implementing km processes in the pkm view. within this paper the authors clarify these implications with an integrated model for introducing social software tools for knowledge management and aligning those with km as well as business processes. their approach emphasizes on aligning the social software activities with km coordination processes, knowledge-intensive business processes and knowledge activities. the authorsâ€™ work also stresses the need to recognize and deal with km barriers within the coordination processes in order to define and implement appropriate interventions and activities.
estimating quantitative genetic parameters in wild populations studies of the quantitative genetics of natural populations have contributed greatly to evolutionary biology in recent years. however, while pedigree data required are often uncertain (i.e. incomplete and partly erroneous) and limited, means to evaluate the effects of such uncertainties have not been developed. we have therefore developed a general framework for power and sensitivity analyses of such studies. we propose that researchers first generate a set of pedigree data that they wish to use in a quantitative genetic study, as well as data regarding errors that occur in that pedigree. this pedigree is then permuted using the data regarding errors to generate hypothetical ‘true’ and ‘assumed’ pedigrees that differ so as to mimic pedigree errors that might occur in the study system under consideration. phenotypic data are then simulated across the true pedigree (according to user‐defined genetic and environmental covariance structures), before being analysed with standard quantitative genetic techniques in conjunction with the ‘assumed’ pedigree data. to illustrate this approach, we conducted power and sensitivity analyses in a well‐known study of soay sheep (ovis aries). we found that, although the estimation of simple genetic (co)variance structures is fairly robust to pedigree errors, some potentially serious biases were detected under more complex scenarios involving maternal effects. power analyses also showed that this study system provides high power to detect heritabilities as low as about 0.09. given this range of results, we suggest that such power and sensitivity analyses could greatly complement empirical studies, and we provide the computer program pedantics to aid in their application.
additivity of entanglement of formation of two three-level-antisymmetric states additivity of the holevo capacity is proved for product channels, under the condition that one of the channels is a unital qubit channel, with the other completely arbitrary. as a byproduct this proves that the holevo bound is the classical information capacity of such qubit channels, and provides an explicit formula for this classical capacity. additivity of minimal entropy and multiplicativity of p-norms are also proved under the same assumptions. the proof relies on a new bound for the p-norm of an output state from the half-noisy phase-damping channel.
hospital acquired pneumonia is linked to right hemispheric peri-insular stroke in this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (rois). using a dataset of 40 mri scans we manually identified 34 cortical rois in each of the individual hemispheres. this information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label rois. to examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (icc), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of rois. when compared with the manual rois, the automated rois were highly accurate, with an average icc of 0.835 across all of the rois, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of rois. these findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. this method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which mri-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.
phosphatase pp2a and microtubule pulling forces disassemble centrosomes during mitotic exit genetic and genome-wide rnai approaches available in c. elegans, combined with tools for visualizing subcellular events with high-resolution, have led to increasing adoption of the early c. elegans embryo as a model for mechanistic and functional genomic analysis of cellular processes. however, a limitation of this system has been the impermeability of the embryo eggshell, which has prevented the routine use of small molecule inhibitors. here, we present a method to permeabilize and immobilize embryos for acute inhibitor treatment in conjunction with live imaging. to identify a means to permeabilize the eggshell, we used a dye uptake assay to screen a set of 310 candidate genes defined by a combination of bioinformatic criteria. this screen identified 20 genes whose inhibition resulted in >75% eggshell permeability, and 3 that permeabilized embryos with minimal deleterious effects on embryo production and early embryonic development. to mount permeabilized embryos for acute drug addition in conjunction with live imaging, we combined optimized inhibition of one of these genes with the use of a microfabricated chamber that we designed. we demonstrate that these two developments enable the temporally controlled introduction of inhibitors for mechanistic studies. this method should also open new avenues of investigation by allowing profiling and specificity-testing of inhibitors through comparison with genome-wide phenotypic datasets.
gambit: a parameterless model-based evolutionary algorithm for mixed-integer problems evolution strategies (ess) are powerful probabilistic search and optimization algorithms gleaned from biological evolution theory. they have been successfully applied to a wide range of real world applications. the modern ess are mainly designed for solving continuous parameter optimization problems. their ability to adapt the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution used for mutation during the optimization run makes them well suited for this domain. in this article we describe and study mixed integer evolution strategies (mies), which are natural extensions of es for mixed integer optimization problems. mies can deal with parameter vectors consisting not only of continuous variables but also with nominal discrete and integer variables. following the design principles of the canonical evolution strategies, they use specialized mutation operators tailored for the aforementioned mixed parameter classes. for each type of variable, the choice of mutation operators is governed by a natural metric for this variable type, maximal entropy, and symmetry considerations. all distributions used for mutation can be controlled in their shape by means of scaling parameters, allowing self-adaptation to be implemented. after introducing and motivating the conceptual design of the mies, we study the optimality of the self-adaptation of step sizes and mutation rates on a generalized (weighted) sphere model. moreover, we prove global convergence of the mies on a very general class of problems. the remainder of the article is devoted to performance studies on artificial landscapes (barrier functions and mixed integer nk landscapes), and a case study in the optimization of medical image analysis systems. in addition, we show that with proper constraint handling techniques, mies can also be applied to classical mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
time course analysis reveals gene-specific transcript and protein kinetics of adaptation to short-term aerobic exercise training in human skeletal muscle in mammals, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (nampt) is responsible for the first and rate-limiting step in the conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad+). nad+ is an obligate cosubstrate for mammalian sirtuin-1 (sirt1), a deacetylase that activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (pgc-1alpha), which in turn can activate mitochondrial biogenesis. given that mitochondrial biogenesis is activated by exercise, we hypothesized that exercise would increase nampt expression, as a potential mechanism leading to increased mitochondrial content in muscle. a cross-sectional analysis of human subjects showed that athletes had about a twofold higher skeletal muscle nampt protein expression compared with sedentary obese, nonobese, and type 2 diabetic subjects (p < 0.05). nampt protein correlated with mitochondrial content as estimated by complex iii protein content (r(2) = 0.28, p < 0.01), mrs-measured maximal atp synthesis (r(2) = 0.37, p = 0.002), and vo(2max) (r(2) = 0.63, p < 0.0001). in an exercise intervention study, nampt protein increased by 127% in sedentary nonobese subjects after 3 wk of exercise training (p < 0.01). treatment of primary human myotubes with forskolin, a camp signaling pathway activator, resulted in an approximately 2.5-fold increase in nampt protein expression, whereas treatment with ionomycin had no effect. activation of ampk via aicar resulted in an approximately 3.4-fold increase in nampt mrna (p < 0.05) as well as modest increases in nampt protein (p < 0.05) and mitochondrial content (p < 0.05). these results demonstrate that exercise increases skeletal muscle nampt expression and that nampt correlates with mitochondrial content. further studies are necessary to elucidate the pathways regulating nampt as well as its downstream effects.
a retrospective look at website accessibility over time a novel metric for quantitatively measuring the content accessibility of the web for persons with disabilities is proposed. the metric is based on the web content accessibility guidelines (wcag) checkpoints, an internationally accepted standard, that can be automatically tested using computer programs. problems with current accessibility evaluation and the need for a good web accessibility metric are discussed. the proposed metric is intended to overcome the deficiencies of the current measurements used in web accessibility studies. the proposed metric meets the requirements as a measurement for scientific research. examples of large-scale web accessibility evaluations using the metric are given. the examples cover a comparison of web accessibility of top medical journal web sites and a longitudinal study of a web site over time. the validity of the metric was tested using a large number of web sites with different levels of compliance (rating categories) to the standard wcag. the metric, which uses a predetermined simple weighting scheme, compares well to the more complex c5.0 machine learning algorithm in separating web sites into different rating categories.
evaluating molecular mechanical potentials for helical peptides and proteins in this paper we present the expandability and flexibility features of the vega program (downloadable free of charge at http://www.ddl.unimi.it), for the development of custom applications, using it as a multipurpose graphical environment. vega can be customized using both plug-in architecture and script programming. the first is useful to add new features and functions, using homemade routines, written with the vega plug-in development kit (sdk). with the second approach it is possible to design scripts in vega, using the rebol language, in order to (1) add new functions or customize existing ones; (2) automate common procedures; and (3) allow network communications, by creating a bridge between vega and other applications (or other pcs) through the tcp/ip protocol.
bent uppermost internode1 encodes the class ii formin fh5 crucial for actin organization and rice development[w][oa] the organization of actin filaments into large ordered structures is a tightly controlled feature of many cellular processes. however, the mechanisms by which actin filament polymerization is initiated from the available pool of profilin-bound actin monomers remain unknown in plants. because the spontaneous polymerization of actin monomers bound to profilin is inhibited, the intervention of an actin promoting factor is required for efficient actin polymerization. two such factors have been characterized from yeasts and metazoans: the arp2/3 complex, a complex of seven highly conserved subunits including two actin-related proteins (arp2 and arp3), and the formin family of proteins. the recent finding that arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking a functional arp2/3 complex exhibit rather modest morphological defects leads us to consider whether the large formin family plays a central role in the regulation of actin polymerization. here, we have characterized the mechanism of action of arabidopsis formin1 (afh1). overexpression of afh1 in pollen tubes has been shown previously to induce abnormal actin cable formation. we demonstrate that afh1 has a unique behavior when compared with nonplant formins. the activity of the formin homology domain 2 (fh2), containing the actin binding activity, is modulated by the formin homology domain 1 (fh1). indeed, the presence of the fh1 domain switches the fh2 domain from a tight capper (kd ∼3.7 nm) able to nucleate actin filaments that grow only in the pointed-end direction to a leaky capper that allows barbed-end elongation and efficient nucleation of actin filaments from actin monomers bound to profilin. another exciting feature of afh1 is its ability to bind to the side and bundle actin filaments. we have identified an actin nucleator that is able to organize actin filaments directly into unbranched actin filament bundles. we suggest that afh1 plays a central role in the initiation and organization of actin cables from the pool of actin monomers bound to profilin.
pathophysiology of paradoxical embolism: evaluation of the role of interatrial septum anatomy based on the intracardiac echocardiography assessment of patients with right-to-left shunting atrial septal aneurysm is a localized "saccular" deformity, generally at the level of the fossa ovalis, which protrudes to the right or the left atrium or both. for 39 months we prospectively analyzed 205 consecutive patients in whom atrial septal aneurysm was diagnosed echocardiographically. the direction and movement of atrial septal aneurysms were carefully studied in multiple views, and, according to our findings, we now propose a new classification: type 1r if the bulging is in the right atrium only, type 2l if the bulging is in the left atrium only, type 3rl if the major excursion bulges to the right atrium and the lesser excursion bulges toward the left, type 4lr if the maximal excursion of the atrial septal aneurysm is toward the left atrium with a lesser excursion toward the right atrium, type 5 if the atrial septal aneurysm movement is bidirectional and equidistant to both atria during the cardiorespiratory cycle. we found an incidence of 1.9%, a mean age of 63 years (25 to 97 years), a female/male ratio of 2:1, valvular regurgitation 74%, hypertension 64%, left ventricular hypertrophy 38%, coronary heart disease 32%, patent foramen ovale 32%, pulmonary hypertension 31%, stroke 20%, dysrhythmias 16%, valvular prolapse 15%, and atrial septal defect 3%. no differences were found between mobile and motionless types of atrial septal aneurysm. however, differences were found between predominantly left bulging or right bulging atrial septal aneurysm (134 versus 57 patients), as well as other variables. all types of atrial septal aneurysm have particular clinical or echocardiographic characteristics. the new classification is a complete, simple, and practical form. atrial septal aneurysm is associated with congenital and acquired heart diseases but also can present as an isolated abnormality.
the role of dcdc2 genetic variants and low socioeconomic status in vulnerability to attention problems despite many articles reporting the problems of dichotomizing continuous measures, researchers still commonly use this practice. the authors' purpose in this article was to understand the reasons that people still dichotomize and to determine whether any of these reasons are valid. they contacted 66 researchers who had published articles using dichotomized variables and obtained their justifications for dichotomization. they also contacted 53 authors of articles published in psychological methods and asked them to identify any situations in which they believed dichotomized indicators could perform better. justifications provided by these two groups fell into three broad categories, which the authors explored both logically and with monte carlo simulations. continuous indicators were superior in the majority of circumstances and never performed substantially worse than the dichotomized indicators, but the simulations did reveal specific situations in which dichotomized indicators performed as well as or better than the original continuous indictors. the authors also considered several justifications for dichotomization that did not lend themselves to simulation, but in each case they found compelling arguments to address these situations using techniques other than dichotomization.
mfge8 regulates enterocyte lipid storage by promoting enterocyte triglyceride hydrolase activity. obesity results in abnormally high levels of triglyceride (tg) storage in tissues such as liver, heart, and muscle, which disrupts their normal functions. recently, we found that lean mice challenged with high levels of dietary fat store tgs in cytoplasmic lipid droplets in the absorptive cells of the intestine, enterocytes, and that this storage increases and then decreases over time after an acute dietary fat challenge. the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity on intestinal tg metabolism. more specifically we asked whether tg storage in and secretion from the intestine are altered in obesity. we investigated these questions in diet-induced obese (dio) and leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice. we found greater levels of tg storage in the intestine of dio mice compared to lean mice in the fed state, but similar levels of tg storage after a 6-h fast. in addition, we found similar tg storage in the intestine of lean and dio mice at multiple time points after an acute dietary fat challenge. surprisingly, we found remarkably lower tg secretion from both dio and ob/ob mice compared to lean controls in response to an acute dietary fat challenge. furthermore, we found altered mrna levels for genes involved in regulation of intestinal tg metabolism in lean and dio mice at 6 h fasting and in response to an acute dietary fat challenge. more specifically, we found that many of the genes related to tg synthesis, chylomicron synthesis, tg storage, and lipolysis were induced in response to an acute dietary fat challenge in lean mice, but this induction was not observed in dio mice. in fact, we found a significant decrease in intestinal mrna levels of genes related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in dio mice in response to an acute dietary fat challenge. our findings demonstrate altered tg handling by the small intestine of obese compared to lean mice.
modulation of regional dispersion of repolarization and t-peak to t-end interval by the right and left stellate ganglia. we studied the effects of regional epicardial application of phenol on autonomic neural control of electrophysiological characteristics of the anterior left ventricle. in eight open-chest dogs, we applied a thin line of 88± phenol on the perimeter encircling a multipolar electrode and measured the effective refractory period (erp) and recorded electrograms in phenol-encircled and untreated areas. before phenol was applied, sympathetic nerve stimulation shortened erp in all areas: percent change (δ) ⩾ 12. phenol application to an area with a radius of 1-2 cm prevented erp shortening in encircled epicardium during sympathetic stimulation, ±δ = 0.9 ± 0.8 (sem), and attenuated erp shortening in underlying endocardium, ±δ = 2.5 ± 1.6, compared to erp shortening in untreated areas, ±δ = 10 ± 1. a subsequent phenol application to an area with a radius of 2-3 cm prevented erp shortening during sympathetic stimulation in both encircled epicardium and underlying endocardium. phenol did not alter electrograms, activation times, or erp shortening produced by norepinephrine infusion; these data suggest that electrophysiological characteristics of ventricular muscle encircled by phenol were unchanged apart from effects of withdrawal of sympathetic neural influence. to support these functional data, norepinephrine content measured in phenol-treated epicardium and endocardium of three dogs was 7 and 21±, respectively, of the norepinephrine content of untreated areas. in eight additional dogs, vagus nerve stimulation during norepinephrine infusion prolonged erp by 3-5 msec both before and after phenol encircling an area with a radius of 2-3 cm. in these dogs, phenol did prevent erp shortening during sympathetic nerve stimulation. we conclude that epicardial phenol interrupts sympathetic neural influences to both epicardial and endocardial sites without impairing responses either to intravenous norepinephrine or to vagus nerve stimulation. circ res 47: 33-40, 1980
biventricular remodeling in murine models of right ventricular pressure overload right ventricular (rv) dysfunction is a common long-term complication in patients after the repair of congenital heart disease. previous investigators have examined the cellular and molecular mechanisms of left ventricular (lv) remodeling, but little is known about the stressed rv. our purpose was to provide a detailed physiological characterization of a model of rv hypertrophy and failure, including rv-lv interaction, and to compare gene alterations between afterloaded rv versus lv. pulmonary artery constriction was performed in 86 mice. mice with mild and moderate pulmonary stenosis (ps) developed stable hypertrophy without decompensation. mice with severe ps developed edema, decreased rv function, and high mortality. tissue doppler imaging demonstrated septal dyssynchrony and deleterious rv-lv interaction in the severe ps group. microarray analysis showed 196 genes with increased expression and 1,114 with decreased expression. several transcripts were differentially increased in the afterloaded rv but not in the afterloaded lv, including clusterin, neuroblastoma suppression of tumorigenicity 1, dkk3, sfrp2, formin binding protein, annexin a7, and lysyl oxidase. we have characterized a murine model of rv hypertrophy and failure, providing a platform for studying the physiological and molecular events of rv remodeling. although the molecular responses of the rv and lv to afterload stress are mostly concordant, there are several key differences, which may represent targets for rv failure-specific therapy.
user guidance for document-driven processes in enterprise systems the common understanding of design science research in information systems (dsris) continues to evolve. only in the broadest terms has there been consensus: that dsris involves, in some way, learning through the act of building. however, what is to be built – the definition of the dsris artifact – and how it is to be built – the methodology of dsris – has drawn increasing discussion in recent years. the relationship of dsris to theory continues to make up a significant part of the discussion: how theory should inform dsris and whether or not dsris can or should be instrumental in developing and refining theory. in this paper, we present the exegesis of a dsris research project in which creating a (prescriptive) design theory through the process of developing and testing an information systems artifact is inextricably bound to the testing and refinement of its kernel theory.
the impact of hearing loss on the quality of life of elderly adults a model of quality of life is proposed that integrates objective and subjective indicators, a broad range of life domains, and individual values. it takes account of concerns that externally derived norms should not be applied without reference to individual differences. it also allows for objective comparisons to be made between the situations of particular groups and what is normative. considerable agreement exists that quality of life is multidimensional. coverage may be categorised within five dimensions: physical wellbeing, material wellbeing, social wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and development and activity. a research agenda is discussed as are the particular problems caused by difficulties in understanding and communicating.
cross-lingual tagger evaluation without test data despite significant recent work, purely unsupervised techniques for part-of-speech (pos) tagging have not achieved useful accuracies required by many language processing tasks. use of parallel text between resource-rich and resource-poor languages is one source of weak supervision that significantly improves accuracy. however, parallel text is not always available and techniques for using it require multiple complex algorithmic steps. in this paper we show that we can build pos-taggers exceeding state-of-the-art bilingual methods by using simple hidden markov models and a freely available and naturally growing resource, the wiktionary. across eight languages for which we have labeled data to evaluate results, we achieve accuracy that significantly exceeds best unsupervised and parallel text methods. we achieve highest accuracy reported for several languages and show that our approach yields better out-of-domain taggers than those trained using fully supervised penn treebank.
mechanism of acid hypersecretion post curative gastrinoma resection to investigate the optimum number of biopsy specimens to be obtained for enterochromaffin-like (ecl) cell monitoring in hypergastrinemic patients and ecl cell regional variations potentially influencing the results, qualitative ecl cell changes were assessed in 149 patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome using jumbo biopsy specimens and a systematic sampling procedure of 4 areas each from the lesser or greater curvature of the gastric body. of 1,176 specimens examined, 1,101 were adequate. the correlation was excellent between different sites within the greater or lesser curvature. in contrast, a normal ecl cell pattern was more frequent in the lesser curvature, whereas linear hyperplasia was more frequent in the greater curvature. dysplastic lesions and carcinoid tumors in endoscopically unremarkable mucosa were detected in 3.4% and 1.2% of biopsy specimens, respectively, and were equally distributed between the lesser and greater curvature. their chances of being diagnosed were related to the number of specimens examined. extensive sampling of both the lesser and greater curvature is recommended for early diagnosis of dysplastic and/or carcinoid lesions in patients at risk. in contrast, limited sampling in the greater curvature seems to be adequate in patients with no risk for carcinoid development.
designing distribution of computations for mobile cloud computing systems thesis proposal this paper describes powerbooter, an automated power model construction technique that uses built-in battery voltage sensors and knowledge of battery discharge behavior to monitor power consumption while explicitly controlling the power management and activity states of individual components. it requires no external measurement equipment. we also describe powertutor, a component power management and activity state introspection based tool that uses the model generated by powerbooter for online power estimation. powerbooter is intended to make it quick and easy for application developers and end users to generate power models for new smartphone variants, which each have different power consumption properties and therefore require different power models. powertutor is intended to ease the design and selection of power efficient software for embedded systems. combined, powerbooter and powertutor have the goal of opening power modeling and analysis for more smartphone variants and their users.
reproducibility in echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function in a population based study (the stanislas cohort study) quantification of cardiac chamber size, ventricular mass and function ranks among the most clinically important and most frequently requested tasks of echocardiography. over the last decades, echocardiographic methods and techniques have improved and expanded dramatically, due to the introduction of higher frequency transducers, harmonic imaging, fully digital machines, left-sided contrast agents, and other technological advancements. furthermore, echocardiography due to its portability and versatility is now used in emergency rooms, operating rooms, and intensive care units. standardization of measurements in echocardiography has been inconsistent and less successful, compared to other imaging techniques and consequently, echocardiographic measurements are sometimes perceived as less reliable. therefore, the american society of echocardiography, working together with the european association of echocardiography, a branch of the european society of cardiology, has critically reviewed the literature and updated the recommendations for quantifying cardiac chambers using echocardiography. this document reviews the technical aspects on how to perform quantitative chamber measurements of morphology and function, which is a component of every complete echocardiographic examination.
a view-based statistical system for multi-view face detection and pose estimation this paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. this work is distinguished by three key contributions. the first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. the second is a learning algorithm, based on adaboost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. the third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. the cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. in the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.
high-throughput linkage analysis of mutator insertion sites in maize. backgroundgene knockouts are a critical resource for functional genomics. in arabidopsis, comprehensive knockout collections were generated by amplifying and sequencing genomic dna flanking insertion mutants. these flanking sequence tags (fsts) map each mutant to a specific locus within the genome. in maize, fsts have been generated using dna transposons. transposable elements can generate unstable insertions that are difficult to analyze for simple knockout phenotypes. transposons can also generate somatic insertions that fail to segregate in subsequent generations.resultstransposon insertion sites from 106 uniformmu fsts were tested for inheritance by locus-specific pcr. we confirmed 89% of the fsts to be germinal transposon insertions. we found no evidence for somatic insertions within the 11% of insertion sites that were not confirmed. instead, this subset of insertion sites had errors in locus-specific primer design due to incomplete or low-quality genomic sequences. the locus-specific pcr assays identified a knockout of a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that co-segregates with a seed mutant phenotype. the mutant phenotype linked to this knockout generates novel hypotheses about the role for the plastid-localized oxidative pentose phosphate pathway during grain-fill.conclusionwe show that fsts from the uniformmu population identify stable, germinal insertion sites in maize. moreover, we show that these sequence-indexed mutations can be readily used for reverse genetic analysis. we conclude from these data that the current collection of 1,882 non-redundant insertion sites from uniformmu provide a genome-wide resource for reverse genetics.
adapting crossover and mutation rates in genetic algorithms in this paper we describe an efficient approach for solving the economic dispatch problem using genetic algorithms (gas). we recommend the use of adaptive probabilities crossover and mutation to realize the twin goals of maintaining diversity in the population and sustaining the convergence capacity of the ga. in the adaptive genetic algorithm (aga), the probabilities of crossover and mutation, pc and pm, are varied depending on the fitness values of the solutions. by using adaptively varying, pc and pm, we also provide a solution to the problem of deciding the optimal values of pc and pm, i.e., pc and pm need not be specified at all. we compare the performance of the aga with that of the standard ga (sga) in optimizing the penalty function by using a sequential unconstrained minimization technique (sumt). in this work, the aga has been applied to a practical 14-bus system to show its feasibility and capabilities. the numerical and graphical results show that the proposed approach is faster and more robust than the simple static
switches: a lightweight runtime for dataflow execution of tasks on many-cores traditional parallel applications have exploited regular parallelism, based on parallel loops. only a few applications exploit sections parallelism. with the release of the new openmp specification (3.0), this programming model supports tasking. parallel tasks allow the exploitation of irregular parallelism, but there is a lack of benchmarks exploiting tasks in openmp. with the current (and projected) multicore architectures that offer many more alternatives to execute parallel applications than traditional smp machines, this kind of parallelism is increasingly important. and so, the need to have some set of benchmarks to evaluate it. in this paper, we motivate the need of having such a benchmarks suite, for irregular and/or recursive task parallelism. we present our proposal, the barcelona openmp tasks suite (bots), with a set of applications exploiting regular and irregular parallelism, based on tasks. we present an overall evaluation of the bots benchmarks in an altix system and we discuss some of the different experiments that can be done with the different compilation and runtime alternatives of the benchmarks.
in vitro assessments of reverse glenoid stability using displacement gages are misleading - recommendations for accurate measurements of interface micromotion. patients with rotator cuff tear arthropathy can be treated successfully with a reverse total shoulder prosthesis. in patients with significant glenoid bone loss, achieving stable bone fixation can be challenging, as the surgeon must know when bone grafting is necessary and when the plan to implant the reverse total shoulder prosthesis should be abandoned because of the likelihood of early implant loosening. the purposes of this study were (1) to determine the initial stability of a metal glenoid implant fixed in a glenoid with a central cavitary defect and (2) to determine whether an altered screw configuration would sufficiently resist implant micromotion and, thereby, allow bone ingrowth to occur. the delta iii reverse total shoulder glenoid implant was fixed into foam scapulae with a uniform density similar to normal glenoid bone density. the control group implants were fixed into foam scapulae without a glenoid defect, by use of the standard surgical technique for screw placement. the second group was fixed into foam scapulae containing a central cavitary glenoid defect, by use of the standard surgical technique for screw placement. the central cavitary defect was meant to simulate the bone loss typically found after the removal of a loose pegged glenoid implant, and it was created with a 4-pegged glenoid drill guide. a third group was fixed into foam scapula with a central cavitary glenoid defect, with an experimental screw configuration by use of a posterior screw directed toward the spine of the scapula and an anterior screw directed inferior to the central peg. all specimens were loaded with 500 cycles of 1 body weight (70 kg) to simulate the forces generated during arm elevation that occur during the first 3 months after surgery. micromotion between the implant and the foam bone was measured with a digital video motion analysis system (accuracy, +/- 2.6 microm). after loading of the implant with 70 kg for 500 cycles in the superior direction, the mean micromotion was 54 microm (sd, 22) in the control group, 159 microm (sd, 70) in the second group, and 86 microm (sd, 32) in the third group (p = 0.003). fixing the posterior screw into the spine of the scapula and directing the anterior screw below the central peg decreased the micromotion of a metal glenoid implant fixed in a glenoid with a cavitary defect by 46% and, more importantly, reduced the micromotion below the critical threshold of 150 microm, which is necessary for bone ingrowth and long-term survival of the implant.
transcriptome and metabolite profiling show that apetala2a is a major regulator of tomato fruit ripening[c][w] fluorescent cell division cycle (cdc)48 proteins were studied in living plant protoplasts. cdc48a and somatic embryogenesis receptor like kinase 1 (serk1) were found to co-localize in the endoplasmatic reticulum (er) and at the plasma membrane (pm), but not in endosomal compartments. fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (flim) was used to detect förster resonance energy transfer (fret) between crfp/yfp-tagged cdc48a and serk1. fret is indicative of direct protein-protein interaction. cdc48a was found to interact only with serk1 in small areas at the pm, but not in endosomes. these findings confirm and extend our previous findings that cdc48a in plants directly interacts with serk1.
aging, opioid-receptor agonists and antagonists, and the vestibulosympathetic reflex in humans. animal studies have demonstrated increases in sympathetic nerve outflow with vestibular stimulation. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether vestibulosympathetic reflexes are engaged in humans. muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna), heart rate, arterial pressure, calf blood flow (cbf), and calculated calf vascular resistance (cvr; mean arterial pressure/cbf) were determined during 10 min of baseline (laying prone with chin supported) and 10 min of head-down neck flexion (hdnf). msna responses were measured in nine subjects, and calf vascular responses were determined in seven of these subjects. heart rate increased during the first minute of hdnf (71 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 3 beats/min; p < 0.05) and remained slightly elevated (71 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 3 beats/min; p < 0.05) for the duration of hdnf. diastolic and mean arterial pressures also increased slightly with hdnf (80 +/- 3 to 82 +/- 3 and 96 +/- 3 to 98 +/- 3 mmhg, respectively; p < 0.05). systolic arterial pressure did not change significantly during hdnf. cbf decreased 14% (4.63 +/- 0.78 to 3.97 +/- 0.60 ml x min(-1) x 100 ml(-1); p < 0.05), and cvr increased 12% (24.0 +/- 4.3 to 27.4 +/- 4.7 units; p < 0.05) during hdnf. these changes corresponded with significant increases in msna during hdnf. msna, expressed as burst frequency, increased from 14 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 2 bursts/min (p < 0.05) and increased 63 +/- 23% (p < 0.05) when expressed as the percent change in total activity. all variables returned to baseline during recovery. thoracic impedance measured in five subjects did not change during hdnf (19.6 +/- 1.2 to 19.7 +/- 1.5 omega), suggesting no major change in central blood volume. the results indicate that hdnf elicits increases in cvr that are mediated by the augmentation of msna. arterial pressure responses and thoracic impedance data suggest that high and low pressure baroreflexes were not the mechanism for sympathetic activation. the immediate increase in msna with hdnf suggests a role for vestibulosympathetic reflexes.
patterns of human herpesvirus-8 oral shedding among diverse cohorts of human herpesvirus-8 seropositive persons background little is known about the clinical and virologic manifestations of human herpesvirus (hhv)-8 infection in immunocompetent persons in the absence of malignancy.   methods a total of 46 human immunodeficiency virus-negative, hhv-8-seropositive men collected saliva daily, and 25 recorded 15 common symptoms daily (gastrointestinal, constitutional, and oropharyngeal) and absences from work or school. quantitative polymerase chain reaction measured hhv-8 dna in saliva.   results some 44 (96%) of 46 men reported having sex with men (msm). of the 44 msm, 27 (61%) had hhv-8 detected in saliva on > or = 1 day; heterosexual men also shed hhv-8. in analyses restricted to msm, hhv-8 dna was detected on 636 (22%) of 2897 days. among msm with hhv-8 detected in saliva, the median rate was 20% (range, 1%-100%), with 30% shedding on > 50% of days, and the median quantity was 4.5 log10 copies/ml (range, 2.0-7.3 log10 copies/ml). the quantity of hhv-8 shed was lower in nonwhites (p<.001) and younger participants (p=.03). the frequency of hhv-8 detection and quantity were correlated (r=0.62; p<.001). symptoms were reported on 10 (9%) of 114 days when hhv-8 was present, compared with 78 (9%) of 830 days without (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% confidence interval, 0.30-2.88]; p=.9).   conclusions hhv-8 is detected frequently and intermittently in the saliva of chronically infected immunocompetent msm, but this infection is asymptomatic.
disease‐causing mutations c277r and c277y modify gating of human clc‐1 chloride channels in myotonia congenita voltage-gated cl− channels belonging to the clc family exhibit unique properties of ion permeation and gating. we functionally probed the conduction pathway of a recombinant human skeletal muscle cl− channel (hclc-1) expressed both in xenopus oocytes and in a mammalian cell line by investigating block by extracellular or intracellular i− and related anions. extracellular and intracellular i− exert blocking actions on hclc-1 currents that are both concentration and voltage dependent. similar actions were observed for a variety of other halide (br−) and polyatomic (scn−, no3 −, ch3so3 −) anions. in addition, i− block is accompanied by gating alterations that differ depending on which side of the membrane the blocker is applied. external i− causes a shift in the voltage-dependent probability that channels exist in three definable kinetic states (fast deactivating, slow deactivating, nondeactivating), while internal i− slows deactivation. these different effects on gating properties can be used to distinguish two functional ion binding sites within the hclc-1 pore. we determined k d values for i− block in three distinct kinetic states and found that binding of i− to hclc-1 is modulated by the gating state of the channel. furthermore, estimates of electrical distance for i− binding suggest that conformational changes affecting the two ion binding sites occur during gating transitions. these results have implications for understanding mechanisms of ion selectivity in hclc-1, and for defining the intimate relationship between gating and permeation in clc channels.
an extension of lazy abstraction with interpolation for programs with arrays we introduce funarray, a parametric segmentation abstract domain functor for the fully automatic and scalable analysis of array content properties. the functor enables a natural, painless and efficient lifting of existing abstract domains for scalar variables to the analysis of uniform compound data-structures such as arrays and collections. the analysis automatically and semantically divides arrays into consecutive non-overlapping possibly empty segments. segments are delimited by sets of bound expressions and abstracted uniformly. all symbolic expressions appearing in a bound set are equal in the concrete. the funarray can be naturally combined via reduced product with any existing analysis for scalar variables. the analysis is presented as a general framework parameterized by the choices of bound expressions, segment abstractions and the reduction operator. once the functor has been instantiated with fixed parameters, the analysis is fully automatic.  we first prototyped funarray in arrayal to adjust and experiment with the abstractions and the algorithms to obtain the appropriate precision/ratio cost. then we implemented it into clousot, an abstract interpretation-based static contract checker for .net. we empirically validated the precision and the performance of the analysis by running it on the main libraries of .net and on its own code. we were able to infer thousands of non-trivial invariants and verify the implementation with a modest overhead (circa 1%). to the best of our knowledge this is the first analysis of this kind applied to such a large code base, and proven to scale.
examining two expectation disconfirmation theory models: assimilation and asymmetry effects user beliefs and attitudes are key perceptions driving information technology usage. these perceptions, however, may change with time as users gain first-hand experience with it usage, which, in turn, may change their subsequent it usage behavior. this paper elaborates how users' be liefs and attitudes change during the course of their it usage, defines emergent constructs driving such change, and proposes a temporal model of belief and attitude change by drawing on expectation-disconfirmation theory and the extant it usage literature. student data from two longitudinal studies in end-user computing (computer-based training system usage) and system development (rapid application development software usage) contexts provided empirical support for the hypothesized model, demonstrated its generalizability across technologies and usage contexts, and allowed us to probe context-specific differences. content analysis of qualitative data validated some of our quantitative results. we report that emergent factors such as disconfirmation and satisfaction are critical to understanding changes in it users' beliefs and attitudes and recommend that they be included in future process models of it usage.
severe autonomic failure in moderate to severe aortic stenosis: prevalence and association with hemodynamics and biomarkers the incidence, correlates, and prognostic implications of pulmonary hypertension (ph) are unclear in patients with severe aortic stenosis (as). we studied 509 patients with severe as evaluated for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (tavi). patients were divided into groups based on pulmonary artery systolic pressure (pasp): group i, 161 (31.6%) with pasp <40 mm hg; group ii, 175 (34.3%) with pasp 40 to 59 mm hg; and group iii, 173 (33.9%) with pasp ≥ 60 mm hg. group iii patients were more symptomatic and had higher creatinine levels and higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. transpulmonary gradient was >12 mm hg in 17 patients (10.5%), 31 patients (17.7%), and 80 patients (46.2%) in groups i through iii, respectively. in a median follow-up of 202 days (73 to 446) mortality rates were 35 (21.7%), 69 (39.3%), and 85 (49.1%) in groups i through iii, respectively (p <0.001). immediately after tavi, in patients with pasp >40 mm hg there was significant decrease in pasp (63.1 ± 16.2 to 48.8 ± 12.4 mm hg, p <0.0001), which remained at 1 year (50.1 ± 13.1 mm hg, p = 0.04). after surgical aortic valve replacement there was a significant immediate decrease in pasp (66.1 ± 16.3 to 44.7 ± 14.2 mm hg, p <0.0001), which persisted at 3 to 12 months (44.8 ± 20.1 mm hg, p <0.001). in patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty, pasp decreased immediately after the procedure (63.2 ± 14.8 to 51.8 ± 17.1 mm hg, p <0.0001), yet at 3 to 12 months pressure returned to baseline levels (57.4 ± 17.0 mm hg, p = 0.29). in conclusion, patients with severe as have a high prevalence of ph, and in patients with severe as increased pasp is associated with increased mortality. surgical aortic valve replacement and tavi are effective treatments for these patients and result in a significant pasp decrease.
evaluation of post-contrast myocardial t1 in duchenne muscular dystrophy using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging backgroundpost-contrast t1 mapping by modified look-locker inversion recovery (molli) sequence has been introduced as a promising means to assess an expansion of the extra-cellular space. however, t1 value in the myocardium can be affected by scanning time after bolus contrast injection. in this study, we investigated the changes of the t1 values according to multiple slicing over scanning time at 15 minutes after contrast injection and usefulness of blood t1 correction.methodseighteen reperfused acute myocardial infarction (ami) patients, 13 cardiomyopathy patients and 8 healthy volunteers underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance with 15 minute-post contrast molli to generate t1 maps. in 10 cardiomyopathy cases, pre- and post-contrast molli techniques were performed to generate extracellular volume fraction (ve). six slices of t1 maps according to the left ventricular (lv) short axis, from apex to base, were consecutively obtained. each t1 value was measured in the whole myocardium, infarcted myocardium, non-infarcted myocardium and lv blood cavity.resultsthe mean t1 value of infarcted myocardium was significantly lower than that of non-infarcted myocardium (425.4±68.1 ms vs. 540.5±88.0 ms, respectively, p< 0.001). t1 values of non-infarcted myocardium increased significantly from apex to base (from 523.1±99.5 ms to 561.1±81.1 ms, p=0.001), and were accompanied by a similar increase in blood t1 value in lv cavity (from 442.1±120.7 ms to 456.8±97.5 ms, p<0.001) over time. this phenomenon was applied to both left anterior descending (lad) territory (from 545.1±74.5 ms to 575.7±84.0 ms, p<0.001) and non-lad territory ami cases (from 501.2±124.5 ms to 549.5±81.3 ms, p<0.001). it was similarly applied to cardiomyopathy patients and healthy volunteers. after the myocardial t1 values, however, were adjusted by the blood t1 values, they were consistent throughout the slices from apex to base (from 1.17±0.18 to 1.25±0.13, p>0.05). the ve did not show significant differences from apical to basal slices.conclusionpost-contrast myocardial t1 corrected by blood t1 or ve, provide more stable measurement of degree of fibrosis in non-infarcted myocardium in short- axis multiple slicing.
persistence of associations between cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction in the early phase of parkinson’s disease the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders is difficult, especially early in the course of the diseases. the clinical subtypes of parkinson's disease (pd) have not so far been described in newly diagnosed patients. we present a prospective incidence cohort study of patients with idiopathic parkinsonian syndromes in the umeå region in northern sweden identified over a 4‐year period. the clinical diagnoses were re‐evaluated at follow‐up visits at 12 months. we found 138 patients with parkinsonism: 112 pd, 12 multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (msa‐p), six progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) and eight unclassifiable patients. the crude incidences for all age ranges per 100,000 were: pd 19.7 (95% confidence interval 16.1–23.3); msa‐p 2.1 (1.1–3.7); psp 1.1 (0.4–2.4); idiopathic parkinsonism 24.3 (20.2–28.4). age‐standardized to the average swedish population 2004–2007: pd 22.5 (18.3–26.7); msa‐p 2.4 (1.2–4.2); psp 1.2 (0.4–2.6); idiopathic parkinsonism 27.5 (22.9–32.1). the crude annual incidence rate for pd, with exclusion of patients with normal dopamine receptor uptake (fp‐cit‐spect), was 18.8 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 15.2–22.4), age‐adjusted to the average swedish population 2004 to 2007: 21.5 (17.4–25.6). the incidence rates did not differ significantly between men and women. the cumulative incidence of pd up to 89 years of age was for men 3.4%, for women 2.6%, and for both sexes combined 2.9%. the annual incidence rates found for pd, idiopathic parkinsonism, msa‐p and psp are among the highest reported. © 2010 movement disorder society
bumetanide enhances phenobarbital efficacy in a rat model of hypoxic neonatal seizures the most common neurological symptom of tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) and focal cortical dysplasia (fcd) is early life refractory epilepsy. as previous studies have shown enhanced excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission in tsc and fcd brains, we hypothesized that neurons associated with these lesions may also express altered γ‐aminobutyric acid (gaba)a receptor (gabaar)‐mediated inhibition.
can seeds help to expel parasites? a comment on the garber-kitron (1997) hypothesis in a comparative study of saguinus mystax and saguinus fuscicollis, we examined the spectrum of plant species whose seeds are dispersed by these two tamarin species. we characterize these plants in terms of life form, fruit colour, pulp consistency and seed dimensions. the tamarins disperse a much broader spectrum of plant species than previously reported (88 of the total of 155 species exploited for fruit). while the distribution over plant life form, fruit colour and pulp consistency is identical between dispersed plant species and the overall spectrum of consumed plant species, clear differences exist in all seed parameters (length, width, height, volume, mass) except specific weight between dispersed and non-dispersed plant species for both tamarin species. plant and fruit characteristics and seed parameters of dispersed plant species do not differ between s. mystax and s. fuscicollis, suggesting that their ecological and evolutionary interaction with plants is very similar or identical.
insulin‐like growth factor ii mrna‐binding protein 3 (imp3) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma. a clinicopathological analysis with emphasis on diagnostic value somatic mutations of the pik3ca gene, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (pi3k), are frequent in various cancer types. the majority of mutations cluster at hotspots within exons 9 and 20, which encode the helical and kinase domains of p110α. pik3ca mutations in bile duct and gallbladder carcinomas have not been reported yet. in this study, we analysed 118 carcinomas of the biliary tract and the liver (45 intra‐ and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (cca), 23 gallbladder carcinomas, 50 hepatocellular carcinomas) for pik3ca hotspot mutations using polymerase chain reaction and direct dna sequencing. pik3ca missense mutations were found in one of 11 intrahepatic cca (e545k, 9%), one of 23 gallbladder carcinomas (e542k, 4%), and one of 50 hepatocellular carcinomas (h1047r, 2%). all three mutations represent hotspot mutations, which also occur in other cancer types. pi3k pathway activation in hepato‐biliary carcinomas was analyzed using immunohistochemistry for the downstream targets eif4‐e and phosphorylated 4e‐bp1 on tissue microarrays. eif4‐e expression was found in 3/13 intrahepatic cca (23%), 9/38 extrahepatic cca (24%), 12/34 gallbladder carcinomas (35%), and 9/61 hepatocellular carcinomas (15%). 4e‐bp1 phosphorylation was observed in 1/13 intrahepatic cca (8%), 8/38 extrahepatic cca (21%), 15/34 gallbladder carcinomas (44%), and 16/61 hepatocellular carcinomas (26%). these results indicate that somatic pik3ca mutations contribute to the frequent activation of the pi3k/akt pathway in carcinomas of the biliary tract and liver. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
genetic architecture is more complex for resistance to septoria tritici blotch than to fusarium head blight in central european winter wheat in cross between inbred lines, linear regression can be used to estimate the correlation of markers with a trait of interest; these marker effects then allow marker assisted selection (mas) for quantitative traits. usually a subset of markers to include in the model must be selected: no completely satisfactory method of doing this exists. we show that replacing this selection of markers by ridge regression can improve the mean response to selection and reduce the variability of selection response.
multiple infection sources identification with provable guarantees assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.
electrostatic control of the overall shape of calmodulin: numerical calculations a method for combining calculations of residue pka's with changes in the position of polar hydrogens has been developed. the boltzmann distributions of proton positions in hydroxyls and neutral titratable residues are found in the same monte carlo sampling procedure that determines the amino acid ionization states at each ph. electrostatic, lennard-jones potentials, and torsion angle energies are considered at each proton position. many acidic and basic residues are found to have significant electrostatic interactions with either a water- or hydroxyl-containing side chain. protonation state changes are coupled to reorientation of the neighboring hydroxyl dipoles, resulting in smaller free energy differences between neutral and ionized residues than when the protein is held rigid. multiconformation ph titration gives better agreement with the experimental pka's for triclinic hen egg lysozyme than conventional rigid protein calculations. the hydroxyl motion significantly increases the protein dielectric response, making it sensitive to the composition of the local protein structure. more than one conformer per residue is often found at a given ph, providing information about the distribution of low-energy lysozyme structures.
performance and fairness for users in parallel job scheduling this work describes the grid and cluster scheduling simulator alea 2 designed for study, testing and evaluation of various job scheduling techniques. this event-based simulator is able to deal with common problems related to the job scheduling like the heterogeneity of jobs, resources, and the dynamic runtime changes such as the arrivals of new jobs or the resource failures and restarts. the alea 2 is based on the popular gridsim toolkit [31] and represents a major extension of the alea simulator, developed in 2007 [16]. the extension covers both improved design, extended functionality as well as the improved scalability and the higher simulation speed. finally, new visualization interface was introduced into the simulator. the main part of the simulator is a complex scheduler which incorporates several common scheduling algorithms working either on the queue or the schedule (plan) based principle. additional data structures are used to maintain information about the resource status, the objective functions and for collection and visualization of the simulation results. many typical objectives such as the machine usage, the average slowdown or the average response time are included. the paper concludes with an example of the alea 2 execution using a real-life workload, discussing also the scalability of the simulator.
the monetary exchange rate model as a long-run phenomenon we examine properties of residual-based tests for the null of no cointegration for dynamic panels in which both the short-run dynamics and the long-run slope coefficients are permitted to be heterogeneous across individual members of the panel. the tests also allow for individual heterogeneous fixed effects and trend terms, and we consider both pooled within dimension tests and group mean between dimension tests. we derive limiting distributions for these and show that they are normal and free of nuisance parameters+ we also provide monte carlo evidence to demonstrate their small sample size and power performance, and we illustrate their use in testing purchasing power parity for the post-bretton woods period.
multigrid methods for strongly ill-conditioned structured matrices in this paper, we consider solutions of toeplitz systems anu = b where the toeplitz matrices an are generated by nonnegative functions with zeros. since the matrices an are ill conditioned, the convergence factor of classical iterative methods, such as the damped jacobi method, will approach one as the size n of the matrices becomes large. here we propose to solve the systems by the multigrid method. the cost per iteration for the method is of o(n log n) operations. for a class of toeplitz matrices which includes weakly diagonally dominant toeplitz matrices, we show that the convergence factor of the two-grid method is uniformly bounded below one independent of n, and the full multigrid method has convergence factor depending only on the number of levels. numerical results are given to illustrate the rate of convergence.
number of days required to estimate habitual activity using wrist-worn geneactiv accelerometer: a cross-sectional study purpose to examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (n = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.   methods physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the computer science applications (csa) accelerometer. day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated.   results physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. for activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring.   conclusion these findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.
lipid converter, a framework for lipid manipulations in molecular dynamics simulations a new force field for the simulation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) in the liquid‐crystalline, fluid phase at zero surface tension is presented. the structure of the bilayer with the area per lipid (0.629 nm2; experiment 0.629–0.64 nm2), the volume per lipid (1.226 nm3; experiment 1.229–1.232 nm3), and the ordering of the palmitoyl chains (order parameters) are all in very good agreement with experiment. experimental electron density profiles are well reproduced in particular with regard to the penetration of water into the bilayer. the force field was further validated by simulating the spontaneous assembly of dppc into a bilayer in water. notably, the timescale on which membrane sealing was observed using this model appears closer to the timescales for membrane resealing suggested by electroporation experiments than previous simulations using existing models. © 2009 wiley periodicals, inc. j comput chem, 2010

stress effects on avt and crf systems in two strains of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) divergent in stress responsiveness abstract: two distinct stress coping styles, proactive and reactive, have been stated in various animal studies. this divergence in coping has also been indicated in salmonid fish. here, we test the hypothesis that divergent stress coping styles are identifiable in a sea‐ranched brown trout population. to that end, we used a series of tests on individual juvenile brown trout, with each test including a common key aspect of the two different coping styles. using a clustering method (sas: proc fastclus), two groups that clearly differed both in blood chemistry (noradrenalin and adrenalin levels) following confinement and in behavior during hypoxia were identified.
clinical and immunological markers of dengue progression in a study cohort from a hyperendemic area in malaysia peptides that bind to a given major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecule share sequence similarity. therefore, a position specific scoring matrix (pssm) or profile derived from a set of peptides known to bind to a specific mhc molecule would be a suitable predictor of whether other peptides might bind, thus anticipating possible t-cell epitopes within a protein. in this approach, the binding potential of any peptide sequence (query) to a given mhc molecule is linked to its similarity to a group of aligned peptides known to bind to that mhc, and can be obtained by comparing the query to the pssm. this article describes the derivation of alignments and profiles from a collection of peptides known to bind a specific mhc, compatible with the structural and molecular basis of the peptide-mhc class i (mhci) interaction. moreover, in order to apply these profiles to the prediction of peptide-mhci binding, we have developed a new search algorithm (rankpep) that ranks all possible peptides from an input protein using the pssm coefficients. the predictive power of the method was evaluated by running rankpep on proteins known to bear mhci k(b)- and d(b)-restricted t-cell epitopes. analysis of the results indicates that > 80% of these epitopes are among the top 2% of scoring peptides. prediction of peptide-mhc binding using a variety of mhci-specific pssms is available on line at our rankpep web server (www.mifoundation.org/tools/rankpep.html). in addition, the rankpep server also allows the user to enter additional profiles, making the server a powerful and versatile computational biology benchmark for the prediction of peptide-mhc binding.
do traditional cardiovascular risk factors solely explain intima-media thickening in youth with type 1 diabetes? objective recent data from the diabetes control and complications trial (dcct) indicated that a1c variability is associated with the risk of diabetes microvascular complications. however, these results might have been influenced by the interventional study design. therefore, we investigated the longitudinal associations between a1c variability and diabetes complications in patients with type 1 diabetes in the observational finnish diabetic nephropathy (finndiane) study. research design and methods a total of 2,107 patients in the finndiane study had complete data on renal status and serial measurements of a1c from baseline to follow-up (median 5.7 years), and 1,845 patients had similar data on cardiovascular disease (cvd) events. intrapersonal sd of serially measured a1c was considered a measure of variability. results during follow-up, 10.2% progressed to a higher albuminuria level or to end-stage renal disease, whereas 8.6% had a cvd event. the sd of serial a1c was 1.01 versus 0.75 (p < 0.001) for renal status and 0.87 versus 0.79 (p = 0.023) for cvd in progressors versus nonprogressors, respectively. in a cox regression model, sd of serial a1c was independently associated with progression of renal disease (hazard ratio 1.92 [95% ci 1.49–2.47]) and of a cvd event (1.98 [1.39–2.82]) even when adjusting for mean a1c and traditional risk factors. interestingly for cvd, mean serial a1c itself was not predictive even though sd of a1c was. conclusions in patients with type 1 diabetes, a1c variability was not only predictive of incident microalbuminuria and progression of renal disease but also of incident cvd events.
divergent phenotype of rat thoracic and abdominal perivascular adipose tissues. adipose tissue inflammation plays a role in cardiovascular (cv) and metabolic diseases associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). the interactive effects of exercise training and metformin, two first-line t2dm treatments, on adipose tissue inflammation are not known. using the hyperphagic, obese, insulin-resistant otsuka long-evans tokushima fatty (oletf) rat model, we tested the hypothesis that treadmill training, metformin, or a combination of these reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue. compared with long-evans tokushima otsuka (leto) control rats (l-sed), sedentary oletf (o-sed) animals secreted significantly greater amounts of leptin from retroperitoneal adipose tissue. conversely, secretion of interleukin (il)-10 by o-sed adipose tissue was lower than that in l-sed animals. examination of leptin and il-10 secretion from adipose tissue in oletf groups treated with endurance exercise training (o-endex), metformin treatment (o-met), and a combination of these (o-e+m) from 20 to 32 wk of age indicated that 1) leptin secretion from adipose tissue was reduced in o-met and o-e+m, but not o-endex animals; 2) adipose tissue il-10 secretion was increased in o-endex and o-e+m but not in o-met animals; and 3) only the combined treatment (o-e+m) displayed both a reduction in leptin secretion and an increase in il-10 secretion. leptin and il-10 concentrations in adipose tissue-conditioned buffers were correlated with their plasma concentrations, adipocyte diameters, and total adiposity. overall, this study indicates that exercise training and metformin have additive influences on adipose tissue secretion and plasma concentrations of leptin and il-10.
ccg supertagging with a recurrent neural network we describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. the procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. as a result of the weight adjustments, internal ‘hidden’ units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. the ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.
evaluation of diffusive transport and cellular uptake of nutrients in tissue engineered constructs using a hybrid discrete mathematical model improved biological and mechanical functionality of musculoskeletal tissue-engineered constructs is required for clinical application, which can only be achieved by comprehensive multidisciplinary research. this review focuses on the contribution of computational modelling as a framework for obtaining an integrated understanding of key processes, which include: nutrient transport and utilization, matrix formation, cell population dynamics, cell attachment and migration, and local cell-cell interactions. such an integrated perspective of these key aspects will be critical to open up new directions in tissue engineering research, as significant progress can be made by combining existing computational and experimental methods. furthermore, theoretical modelling has enormous potential in applications ranging from the interpretation of experimental results and the identification of the main governing processes, to the optimization of practical tissue engineering protocols with implications therein for an increasing ageing population.
mean shifts identification model in bivariate process based on ls-svm pattern recognizer multivariate statistical procedures for monitoring the progress of batch processes are developed. multi-way partial least squares (mpls) is used to extract the information from the process measurement variable trajectories that is more relevant to the final quality variables of the product. the only information needed is a historical database of past successful batches. new batches can be monitored through simple monitoring charts which are consistent with the philosophy of statistical process control. these charts monitor the batch operation and provide on-line predictions of the final product qualities. approximate confidence intervals for the predictions from pls models are developed. the approach is illustrated using a simulation study of a styrene-butadiene batch reactor.
aquatic hyphomycetes, benthic macroinvertebrates and leaf litter decomposition in streams naturally differing in riparian vegetation the effect of preservation methods on dry weight (dw) and ash-free dry weight (afdw) of radix peregra (gastropoda), asellus aquaticus (isopoda), erpobdella octoculata (hirudinea) and glyptotendipes sp. (chironomidae) was studied. ethanol, formaldehyde, and bouin were used as preservative. in case of preservation of macro-invertebrates in ethanol substancial changes in dw and afdw biomass were observed. in the four different taxa the loss in dw varied between 7.2–21.9% after a 3 month preservation period in 70% ethanol. a comparatively small range in afdw loss (16.2–19.7%) was found. changes in dw and afdw biomass during preservation were significantly affected by the duration of the preservation, by temperature, light conditions and the volume of the preservative. the changes in afdw were also significantly affected by the concentration of the preservatives. preservation in 10% formaldehyde did not cause significant changes in dw and afdw biomass.
spatially discordant alternans and arrhythmias in tachypacing-induced cardiac myopathy in transgenic lqt1 rabbits: the importance of iks and ca2+ cycling long qt syndrome (lqts) is a heritable disease associated with ecg qt interval prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in young patients. among genotyped individuals, mutations in genes encoding repolarizing k+ channels (lqt1:kcnq1; lqt2:kcnh2) are present in approximately 90% of affected individuals. expression of pore mutants of the human genes kcnq1 (kvlqt1-y315s) and kcnh2 (herg-g628s) in the rabbit heart produced transgenic rabbits with a long qt phenotype. prolongations of qt intervals and action potential durations were due to the elimination of iks and ikr currents in cardiomyocytes. lqt2 rabbits showed a high incidence of spontaneous sudden cardiac death (>50% at 1 year) due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. optical mapping revealed increased spatial dispersion of repolarization underlying the arrhythmias. both transgenes caused downregulation of the remaining complementary ikr and iks without affecting the steady state levels of the native polypeptides. thus, the elimination of 1 repolarizing current was associated with downregulation of the reciprocal repolarizing current rather than with the compensatory upregulation observed previously in lqts mouse models. this suggests that mutant kvlqt1 and herg interacted with the reciprocal wild-type alpha subunits of rabbit erg and kvlqt1, respectively. these results have implications for understanding the nature and heterogeneity of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.
cross-national analysis of the associations between traumatic events and suicidal behavior: findings from the who world mental health surveys context previous research has shown that exposure to traumatic events, especially sexual trauma during childhood, is associated with an increased risk of attempted suicide. however, no information is available as to whether the increased risk of attempted suicide is related primarily to posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) following traumatic experiences or applies also to persons who experienced trauma but did not develop ptsd.   objective we examine the association between exposure to traumatic events with and without resulting ptsd and the risk of a subsequent suicide attempt in a community sample of urban young adults.   design a cohort study followed young adults who had participated in a randomized trial of all first-grade students entering 19 public schools.   setting baltimore, maryland, an urban setting.   participants a total of 1698 young adults (mean age, 21; 47% male; 71% african american) who represented 75% of the original cohort of 2311 persons.   main outcome measure relative risk of a subsequent suicide attempt associated with ptsd and with exposure to assaultive and non-assaultive traumas (no ptsd), as estimated using discrete time survival analysis.   results posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with increased risk of a subsequent suicide attempt. the ptsd-suicide attempt association was robust, even after adjustment for a prior major depressive episode, alcohol abuse or dependence, and drug abuse or dependence (adjusted relative risk, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.5; p < .01). in contrast, exposure to traumatic events without ptsd was not associated with an increased risk of attempted suicide.   conclusions posttraumatic stress disorder is an independent predictor of attempted suicide. exposure to traumatic events without ptsd is not associated with a later suicide attempt.
scalable gaussian processes with billions of inducing inputs via tensor train decomposition we introduce stochastic variational inference for gaussian process models. this enables the application of gaussian process (gp) models to data sets containing millions of data points. we show how gps can be variationally decomposed to depend on a set of globally relevant inducing variables which factorize the model in the necessary manner to perform variational inference. our approach is readily extended to models with non-gaussian likelihoods and latent variable models based around gaussian processes. we demonstrate the approach on a simple toy problem and two real world data sets.
functional alpha6-containing nicotinic receptors are present in chick retina. 1 starting from the structure of an old 4‐oxystilbene derivate with ganglioplegic activity (mg624), we synthesized two further derivates (f2 and f3) and two stereoisomers of f3 (f3a and f3b), and studied their selective effect on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (achr) subtypes. 2 mg 624, f3, f3a and f3b inhibited of 125i‐αbungarotoxin (αbgtx) binding to neuronal chick optic lobe (col) membranes, with nm affinity, but inhibited 125i‐αbgtx binding to te671 cell‐expressed muscle‐type achr only at much higher concentrations. 3 we immobilized the α7, β2 and β4 containing chick neuronal nicotinic achr subtypes using anti‐subunit specific antibodies. mg 624, f3, f3a and f3b inhibited 125i‐αbgtx binding to the α7‐containing receptors with nm affinity, but inhibited 3h‐epi binding to β2‐containing receptors only at very high concentrations (more than 35 μm); their affinity for the β4‐containing receptors was ten times more than for the β2‐containing subtype. 4 both mg624 and f3 compounds inhibited the ach evoked currents in homomeric oocyte‐expressed chick α7 receptors with an ic50 of respectively 94 and 119 nm. 5 high doses of both mg 624 and f3 depressed the contractile response to vagus nerve stimulation in guinea pig nerve‐stomach preparations although at different ic50s (49.4 vs 166.2 μm) the effect of mg624 on rat nerve‐hemidiaphragm preparations was 33 times less potent than that of f3 (ic50 486 vs 14.5 μm). 6 in conclusion, mg624 and f3 have a high degree of antagonist selectivity for neuronal nicotinic αbgtx receptors containing the α7 subunit.
reward rate optimization in two-alternative decision making: empirical tests of theoretical predictions. a method of obtaining an average reaction time distribution for a group of subjects is described. the method is particularly useful for cases in which data from many subjects are available but there are only 10-20 reaction time observations per subject cell. essentially, reaction times for each subject are organized in ascending order, and quantiles are calculated. the quantiles are then averaged over subjects to give group quantiles (cf. vincent learning curves). from the group quantiles, a group reaction time distribution can be constructed. it is shown that this method of averaging is exact for certain distributions (i.e., the resulting distribution belongs to the same family as the individual distributions). furthermore, monte carlo studies and application of the method to the combined data from three large experiments provide evidence that properties derived from the group reaction time distribution are much the same as average properties derived from the data of individual subjects. this article also examines how to quantitatively describe the shape of reaction time distributions. the use of moments and cumulants as sources of information about distribution shape is evaluated and rejected because of extreme dependence on long, outlier reaction times. as an alternative, the use of explicit distribution functions as approximations to reaction time distributions is considered.
variational particle approximations we consider the analysis of data under mixture models where the number of components in the mixture is unknown. we concentrate on mixture dirichlet process models, and in particular we consider such models under conjugate priors. this conjugacy enables us to integrate out many of the parameters in the model, and to discretize the posterior distribution. particle filters are particularly well suited to such discrete problems, and we propose the use of the particle filter of fearnhead and clifford for this problem. the performance of this particle filter, when analyzing both simulated and real data from a gaussian mixture model, is uniformly better than the particle filter algorithm of chen and liu. in many situations it outperforms a gibbs sampler. we also show how models without the required amount of conjugacy can be efficiently analyzed by the same particle filter algorithm.
use of glacier river-fed estuary channels by juvenile coho salmon: transitional or rearing habitats? fisheries scientists face a challenge in that virtually all methods of fish capture or observation are selective. further, most fish capture methods can be applied to only a fraction of the entire area of interest. thus, measures such as catch per unit effort (c/f) or catch per area can only be regarded, at best, as being proportional to the true population abundance (see chapter 7). the methods presented in this chapter are designed to address these problems and provide estimates of absolute abundance or “true” fish density. in general, these methods require additional sampling beyond that required to estimate relative abundance. as such, careful consideration should be given to whether relative measures of abundance are adequate or if the need for estimates of absolute abundance justifies the additional cost. in many cases, relative abundance is sufficient to answer important research or management questions. one example is when the principal goal is to determine if abundance has changed over time. as long as vulnerability to the gear remains constant over time, trends in c/f can accurately indicate changes in abundance (see chapter 7). in such cases, the extra effort required to determine absolute abundance is better spent in sampling more sites. in general, estimates of absolute abundance are needed when catchability is likely to vary across time or between sampling sites, confounding comparisons of c/f across space or time. absolute abundance estimates are also important when harvest quotas are being computed. whether relative or absolute measures of abundance are desired, it is critical to define the population of interest carefully. in many cases, some part of the population is excluded from consideration because of limitations of the sampling gear. for example, population estimates of yellow perch in midsummer conducted by means of gill nets would likely not include age-0 fish because they would not be
learning discriminative space–time action parts from weakly labelled videos abstract platt’s probabilistic outputs for support vector machines (platt, j. in smola, a., et al. (eds.) advances in large margin classifiers. cambridge, 2000) has been popular for applications that require posterior class probabilities. in this note, we propose an improved algorithm that theoretically converges and avoids numerical difficulties. a simple and ready-to-use pseudo code is included.

a transcriptionally active maize mudr-like transposable element in rice and its relatives mutator is a powerful system for generating new mutants in maize. mutator activity is attributable to a family of transposable, multicopy mu elements, but none of the known elements is an autonomous (regulatory) element. this paper reports the discovery of mu9, a 4942-base-pair mu element that was cloned after it transposed into the bronze-2 locus. like other mu elements, mu9 has approximately 215-base-pair terminal inverted repeats and creates a 9-base-pair host sequence duplication upon insertion. a small gene family of elements that cross-hybridize to mu9 has been found in all maize lines, and one of the other known mu elements, mu5, probably arose as a deletion of mu9. mu9 has several of the properties expected for the proposed regulator of mutator activity. (i) the presence of mu9 parallels the presence of mutator activity in individuals from a line that genetically segregates for the mu regulator. (ii) lines that transmit mutator to greater than 90% of their progeny have multiple copies of mu9. (iii) most maize lines that lack mutator activity and that are not descended from mutator lines lack the mu9 element. (iv) transcripts that hybridize to mu9 are abundant in active mutator lines, but they are absent from lines that have epigenetically lost mutator activity. these correlations suggest that mu9 is a candidate for the autonomous mutator element.
moderate and heavy metabolic stress interval training improve arterial stiffness and heart rate dynamics in humans primary objective in order to corroborate the rported performance advantage of poincaré plot indexes as autonomic activity markers, the correlation among these indexes and those computed from the time and frequency domains were obtained.   methods and procedures starting from the rr series derived from the ecg of 21 healthy volunteers during five manoeuvres, longitudinal (l), transverse (t) axis, and autocorrelation (r) from poincaré plots, rmssd and standard deviation (sd) in the temporal domain, and frequency domain indexes were computed.   main outcomes and results poincaré plot indexes were correlated in a better way with the time indexes, rather than the spectral measures. a strong correlation (0.997) between l and sd was observed, while an underlying mathematical relationship was established for t vs rmssd.   conclusions poincaré plot indexes may be considered as equivalent or surrogates of the temporal ones, and they do not have a better performance as autonomic markers.
chronic consumption of farmed salmon containing persistent organic pollutants causes insulin resistance and obesity in mice aims/hypothesistreatment with glucocorticoids, especially at high doses, induces insulin resistance. the aims of the present study were to identify the potential defects in insulin signalling that contribute to dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscles, and to investigate whether the glycogen synthase-3 (gsk-3) inhibitor chir-637 could restore insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism.materials and methodsskeletal muscles were made insulin-resistant by treating male wistar rats with dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid analogue, for 12 days. insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis and insulin signalling were studied in skeletal muscles in vitro.resultsdexamethasone treatment decreased the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis and glycogen synthase fractional activity. in addition, the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase by insulin was blocked. these defects were paralleled by reduced insulin-stimulated protein kinase b (pkb) and gsk-3 phosphorylation. while expression of pkb, gsk-3 and glycogen synthase was not reduced by dexamethasone treatment, expression of the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase) was increased. inhibition of gsk-3 by chir-637 increased glycogen synthase fractional activity in soleus muscle from normal and dexamethasone-treated rats, although the effect was more pronounced in control rats. chir-637 did not improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles from dexamethasone-treated rats.conclusions/interpretationwe demonstrated that chronic dexamethasone treatment impairs insulin-stimulated pkb and gsk-3 phosphorylation, which may contribute to insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. acute pharmacological inhibition of gsk-3 activated glycogen synthase in muscles from dexamethasone-treated rats, but gsk-3 inhibition did not restore insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.

advanced pseudomyxoma peritonei requiring gastrectomy to achieve complete cytoreduction results in good long-term oncologic outcomes pseudomyxoma peritonei (pmp) is a complex disease with unique biological behavior that usually arises from appendiceal mucinous neoplasia. the classification of pmp and its primary appendiceal neoplasia is contentious, and an international modified delphi consensus process was instigated to address terminology and definitions. a classification of mucinous appendiceal neoplasia was developed, and it was agreed that “mucinous adenocarcinoma” should be reserved for lesions with infiltrative invasion. the term “low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm” was supported and it was agreed that “cystadenoma” should no longer be recommended. a new term of “high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm” was proposed for lesions without infiltrative invasion but with high-grade cytologic atypia. serrated polyp with or without dysplasia was preferred for tumors with serrated features confined to the mucosa with an intact muscularis mucosae. consensus was achieved on the pathologic classification of pmp, defined as the intraperitoneal accumulation of mucus due to mucinous neoplasia characterized by the redistribution phenomenon. three categories of pmp were agreed—low grade, high grade, and high grade with signet ring cells. acellular mucin should be classified separately. it was agreed that low-grade and high-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei should be considered synonymous with disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis and peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis, respectively. a checklist for the pathologic reporting of pmp and appendiceal mucinous neoplasms was also developed. by adopting the classifications and definitions that were agreed, different centers will be able to use uniform terminology that will allow meaningful comparison of their results.
comparison of 7t and 3t mri in patients with moyamoya disease. this study proposes an anatomically based nomenclature for the internal carotid artery (ica) that can be applied by all disciplines. in 1938, fischer published a seminal paper describing five segments of the ica that were designated c1 through c5. these segments were based on the angiographic course of the intracranial ica rather than its arterial branches or anatomic compartments. subsequent attempts to apply modern nomenclature to these numerical segments failed to recognize fischer's original intent of describing patterns of arterial displacement by tumors and, therefore, resulted in a nomenclature that was anatomically inaccurate. fischer's system was further limited, because segments were numbered opposite the direction of blood flow and the extracranial ica was excluded. the authors propose a new classification, which includes the entire ica, uses a numerical scale in the direction of blood flow, and describes the segments of the ica according to a detailed understanding of the anatomy surrounding the ica and the compartments through which it travels. twenty cadaveric specimens with intravascular injection of silicone rubber were used for microscopic dissection and 20 dry skulls were inspected. histological sections in critical areas were examined. the authors' classification has the following seven segments: c1, cervical; c2, petrous; c3, lacerum; c4 cavernous; c5, clinoid; c6, ophthalmic; and c7, communicating. this classification is practical, accounts for new anatomic information and clinical interests, and clarifies all segments of the ica.
does the director election system matter? evidence from majority voting this paper presents a parameter covariance matrix estimator which is consistent even when the disturbances of a linear regression model are heteroskedastic. this estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity. by comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. the test has an appealing least squares interpretation.
correcting grammatical verb errors we consider the problem of correcting errors made by english as a second language (esl) writers and address two issues that are essential to making progress in esl error correction - algorithm selection and model adaptation to the first language of the esl learner.    a variety of learning algorithms have been applied to correct esl mistakes, but often comparisons were made between incomparable data sets. we conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets.    a second key issue in esl error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language of the writer. errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the non-native writers. we propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.
shifting toward cooperative tendencies and forgiveness: how partner‐focused prayer transforms motivation the present study took a critical look at a central construct in couples research: relationship satisfaction. eight well-validated self-report measures of relationship satisfaction, including the marital adjustment test (mat; h. j. locke & k. m. wallace, 1959), the dyadic adjustment scale (das; g. b. spanier, 1976), and an additional 75 potential satisfaction items, were given to 5,315 online participants. using item response theory, the authors demonstrated that the mat and das provided relatively poor levels of precision in assessing satisfaction, particularly given the length of those scales. principal-components analysis and item response theory applied to the larger item pool were used to develop the couples satisfaction index (csi) scales. compared with the mas and the das, the csi scales were shown to have higher precision of measurement (less noise) and correspondingly greater power for detecting differences in levels of satisfaction. the csi scales demonstrated strong convergent validity with other measures of satisfaction and excellent construct validity with anchor scales from the nomological net surrounding satisfaction, suggesting that they assess the same theoretical construct as do prior scales. implications for research are discussed.
electroacupuncture reduces myocardial infarct size and improves post-ischemic recovery by invoking release of humoral, dialyzable, cardioprotective factors to the editor:  kharbanda et al1 recently published experimental evidence for remote myocardial preconditioning (rmp)1,2 in swine. in addition, they provided evidence for remote skeletal preconditioning (rsp) in humans by showing protection against endothelial dysfunction produced by sustained ischemia and reperfusion in an arm after brief ischemia in the contralateral arm of healthy subjects.1 the authors did not determine the mechanisms of rsp and rmp in their study but pointed out the many similarities between classical myocardial preconditioning (cmp) and rmp and equated rmp produced by skeletal muscle ischemia with rsp. however, this appears to be an oversimplification.  firstly, the type of stimulus required to elicit rmp differs from that of cmp. thus, three periods of 3-minute coronary artery occlusion (3×3-minute cao) interspersed by 5 minutes of reperfusion elicits cardioprotection in rats that is superior to that …
mitigating evasion attacks to deep neural networks via region-based classification neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples: inputs that are close to natural inputs but classified incorrectly. in order to better understand the space of adversarial examples, we survey ten recent proposals that are designed for detection and compare their efficacy. we show that all can be defeated by constructing new loss functions. we conclude that adversarial examples are significantly harder to detect than previously appreciated, and the properties believed to be intrinsic to adversarial examples are in fact not. finally, we propose several simple guidelines for evaluating future proposed defenses.
selective targeting of trpv1 expressing sensory nerve terminals in the spinal cord for long lasting analgesia the actions of opioid agonists in the substantia gelatinosa are important for their antinociceptive effects. in order to identify possible mechanisms underlying opioid actions in the substantia gelatinosa, the pre- and postsynaptic effects of opioid agonists on neurons of the substantia gelatinosa were examined using a brain slice preparation. intracellular recordings were made from neurons of the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis in guinea pig and rat. to correlate morphology and electrophysiology, neurons were filled with biocytin and visualized using hrp. the majority of neurons (86%) were hyperpolarized by [met]5enkephalin (me), and this was mimicked by the mu-opioid agonist (d-ala2,n-me-phe4,gly5- ol)enkephalin (damgo) but not the delta-opioid agonist (d- pen2,5)enkephalin (dpdpe). naloxone (300 nm) shifted the damgo dose- response 213-fold to the right, giving an estimated kd of 1.4 nm. under voltage clamp, the me current reversed polarity at the potassium equilibrium potential, indicating the hyperpolarization was due to an increase in potassium conductance. epsps mediated by glutamate were evoked by stimulating the spinal trigeminal tract, which contains the primary afferent fibers that synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. the excitation produced by stimulating the spinal trigeminal tract was greatly enhanced in the presence of glycine and gabaa receptor antagonists, indicating that local inhibitory circuitry is activated by exciting the primary afferents. the epsps were reduced by mu- but not delta-opioid receptor activation. the degree of inhibition varied from 0 to 100%. these results indicate that opioid agonists cause inhibition in the substantia gelatinosa by both pre- and postsynaptic actions.
postprandial plasma phospholipids in men are influenced by the source of dietary fat. summary the common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (fwer). this approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. a different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. it calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. this error rate is equivalent to the fwer when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the fwer is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. a simple sequential bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. the use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.

the rice nuclear genome continuously integrates, shuffles, and eliminates the chloroplast genome to cause chloroplast–nuclear dna fluxw⃞ orthologous regions in barley, rice, sorghum, and wheat were studied by bacterial artificial chromosome sequence analysis. general microcolinearity was observed for the four shared genes in this region. however, three genic rearrangements were observed. first, the rice region contains a cluster of 48 predicted small nucleolar rna genes, but the comparable region from sorghum contains no homologous loci. second, gene 2 was inverted in the barley lineage by an apparent unequal recombination after the ancestors of barley and wheat diverged, 11-15 million years ago (mya). third, gene 4 underwent direct tandem duplication in a common ancestor of barley and wheat 29-41 mya. all four of the shared genes show the same synonymous substitution rate, but nonsynonymous substitution rates show significant variations between genes 4a and 4b, suggesting that gene 4b was largely released from the strong purifying selection that acts on gene 4a in both barley and wheat. intergenic retrotransposon blocks, many of them organized as nested insertions, mostly account for the lower gene density of the barley and wheat regions. all but two of the retrotransposons were found in the regions between genes, while all but 2 of the 51 inverted repeat transposable elements were found as insertions in genic regions and outside the retrotransposon blocks.
structured output prediction for semantic perception in autonomous vehicles autonomous driving is a key factor for future mobility. properly perceiving the environment of the vehicles is essential for a safe driving, which requires computing accurate geometric and semantic information in real-time. in this paper, we challenge state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for building a perception system for autonomous driving. an inherent drawback in the computation of visual semantics is the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. we propose to circumvent this problem by following an offline-online strategy. during the offline stage dense 3d semantic maps are created. in the online stage the current driving area is recognized in the maps via a re-localization process, which allows to retrieve the pre-computed accurate semantics and 3d geometry in real-time. then, detecting the dynamic obstacles we obtain a rich understanding of the current scene. we evaluate quantitatively our proposal in the kitti dataset and discuss the related open challenges for the computer vision community.
localization by site-directed mutagenesis of a galantamine binding site on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor extracellular domain galantamine (reminyl), an approved treatment for alzheimer's disease (ad), is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand (apl) of human α3β4, α4β2, and α6β4 nicotinic receptors (nachrs), and of the chicken/mouse chimeric α7/5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor, as was shown by whole-cell patch-clamp studies of human embryonic kidney-293 cells stably expressing a single nachr subtype. galantamine potentiates agonist responses of the four nachr subtypes studied in the same window of concentrations (i.e., 0.1–1 μm), which correlates with the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of the drug at the recommended daily dosage of 16 to 24 mg. at concentrations >10 μm, galantamine acts as an nachr inhibitor. the other presently approved ad drugs, donepezil and rivastigmine, are devoid of the nicotinic apl action; at micromolar concentrations they also block nachr activity. using five cho-sre-luci cell lines, each of them expressing a different human muscarinic receptor, and a reporter gene assay, we show that galantamine does not alter the activity of m1–m5 receptors, thereby confirming that galantamine modulates selectively the activity of nachrs. these studies support our previous proposal that the therapeutic action of galantamine is mainly produced by its sensitizing action on nachrs rather than by general cholinergic enhancement due to cholinesterase inhibition. galantamine's apl action directly addresses the nicotinic deficit in ad.
pathway-basedfeature selection algorithm for cancer microarray data a reliable and precise classi cation of tumors is essential for successful treatment of cancer. cdna microarrays and high-density oligonucleotide chips are novel biotechnologies which are being used increasingly in cancer research. by allowing the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, such techniques may lead to a more complete understanding of the molecular variations among tumors and hence to a ner and more informative classi cation. the ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classi cation. in this paper, we compare the performance of di erent discrimination methods for the classication of tumors based on gene expression data. these methods include: nearest neighbor classi ers, linear discriminant analysis, and classi cation trees. in our comparison, we also consider recent machine learning approaches such as bagging and boosting. we investigate the use of prediction votes to assess the con dence of each prediction. the methods are applied to datasets from three recently published cancer gene expression studies.
assisted reproduction treatment and epigenetic inheritance recent studies suggest that transgenerational genome instability may be epigenetic in nature and mediated via altered dna methylation and micrornaome. here, we investigated the nature and mechanisms underlying the disruption of dna methylation and microrna expression status in the germline and progeny of exposed parents. we have found that paternal irradiation leads to upregulation of the mir-29 family in the exposed male germline, which causes decreased expression of de novo methyltransferase, dna methyltransferase 3a, and profound hypomethylation of long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (line1) and short interspersed nuclear elements b2 (sine b2). epigenetic changes in the male germline further resulted in deleterious effects in the somatic thymus tissue from the progeny of exposed animals, including hypomethylation of line1 and sine b2. hypomethylation of line1 and sine b2 in the thymus tissue from the progeny was associated with a significant decrease in the levels of lymphoid-specific helicase (lsh) that is crucial for the maintenance of methylation and silencing of repetitive elements. furthermore, we noted a significant upregulation of mir-468 that targets lsh and leads to its decreased expression in thymus in the progeny of exposed parents. we suggest that mir-468-mediated suppression of lsh leads to aberrant methylation of line1 and sine b2. in summary, altered micrornaome and hypomethylation of retroelements constitute deleterious effects that may significantly influence genome stability of the parental germline and consequently cause genome instability in the progeny.
a quadrilateral-object composer for binary images with reaction-diffusion cellular automata excitable media are spatially distributed systems characterized by their ability to propagate signals undamped over long distances. wave propagation in excitable media has been modeled extensively both by continuous partial differential equations and by discrete cellular automata. cellular automata are desirable because of their intuitive appeal and efficient digital implementation, but until now they have not served as reliable models because they have lacked two essential properties of excitable media. first, traveling waves show dispersion, that is, the speed of wave propagation into a recovering region depends on the time elapsed since the preceding wave passed through that region. second, wave speed depends on wave front curvature: curved waves travel with normal velocities noticeably different from the plane-wave velocity. these deficiencies of cellular automation models are remedied by revising the classical rules of the excitation and recovery processes. the revised model shows curvature and dispersion effects comparable to those of continuous models, it predicts rotating spiral wave solutions in quantitative accord with the theory of continuous excitable media, and it is parameterized so that the spatial step size of the automation can be adjusted for finer resolution of traveling waves.
identification of stoml2 as a putative novel asthma risk gene associated with il6r the ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. the recently developed rna sequencing (rna-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. however, we show that rna-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. in particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (gc-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. we also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42% without loss of accuracy. our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as gc-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.
the ict convergence discourse in the information systems literature - a second-order observation the range of legitimate methods in is research has expanded considerably over the past 20 years, a process to which ifip working group 8.2 is seen to have made an important contribution. this has probably made it even harder, however, for is researchers to know what constitutes good methodological practice. this paper addresses this issue from two angles: first through a critical analysis of claims made in the is literature regarding the characteristics of good research; and second through an examination of the use of methodology, as reported in a number of is research papers. the characteristics of good research considered are that it should follow the scientific method; that it should fulfil certain criteria; that it should be relevant; and that it should employ multiple methods each of these is shown to have limitations. with respect to methodology in practice, the analysis indicates a remarkable lack of consistency in the reporting of is research. the implications of these findings are discussed.
patterns of courtship behavior and ejaculate characteristics in male red-winged blackbirds the numbers and proportion of spermatozoa reaching different parts of the female reproductive tract after a single natural insemination were investigated in zebra finches taeniopygia guttata. the number of spermatozoa transferred during a single, natural copulation was estimated by comparing the number of spermatozoa in the seminal glomera of males that had performed a single copulation with control males. the mean number of spermatozoa per ejaculate was 5.8 x 10(6) +/- 1.80 x 10(6) sem. the mean number of spermatozoa stored in the sperm storage tubules in the uterovaginal junction following a single, natural insemination was 6027 +/- 1874, 0.104% of those inseminated. the mean number of spermatozoa reaching the infundibulum and trapped on the perivitelline layer of all eggs of the clutch after a single copulation was 45.6 +/- 9.18 and a further 36 penetrated the perivitelline layer of the ovum, i.e. 82 in total (1.4% of the spermatozoa in the sperm storage tubules and 0.001% of spermatozoa in the ejaculate). female zebra finches that completed a natural breeding cycle with a mean of 12 copulations had 404 +/- 111 spermatozoa trapped on the perivitelline layer of all eggs of the clutch, and an estimated further 173 spermatozoa penetrated the perivitelline layer. a smaller proportion of spermatozoa was trapped on the perivitelline layer of zebra finch eggs, than in chicken or turkey eggs.
characterization of antifungal activity of the gh-46 subclass iii chitosanase from bacillus circulans mh-k1 three kinds of improvements have been introduced into the m13-based cloning systems. (1) new escherichia coli host strains have been constructed for the e. coli bacteriophage m13 and the high-copy-number puc-plasmid cloning vectors. mutations introduced into these strains improve cloning of unmodified dna and of repetitive sequences. a new suppressorless strain facilitates the cloning of selected recombinants. (2) the complete nucleotide sequences of the m13mp and puc vectors have been compiled from a number of sources, including the sequencing of selected segments. the m13mp18 sequence is revised to include the g-to-t substitution in its gene ii at position 6 125 bp (in m13) or 6967 bp in m13mp18. (3) m13 clones suitable for sequencing have been obtained by a new method of generating unidirectional progressive deletions from the polycloning site using exonucleases hi and vii.
the absence of a mature cell wall sacculus in stable listeria monocytogenes l-form cells is independent of peptidoglycan synthesis abstract listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that elicits a strong cellular immune response following infection and therefore has potential use as a vaccine vector. however, while infections by l. monocytogenes are fairly rare and can readily be controlled by a number of antibiotics, the organism can nevertheless cause meningitis and death, particularly in immunocompromised or pregnant patients. we therefore have endeavored to isolate a highly attenuated strain of this organism for use as a vaccine vector. d-alanine is required for the synthesis of the mucopeptide component of the cell walls of virtually all bacteria and is found almost exclusively in the microbial world. we have found in l. monocytogenes two genes that control the synthesis of this compound, an alanine racemase gene (dal) and ad-amino acid aminotransferase gene (dat). by inactivating both genes, we produced an organism that could be grown in the laboratory when supplemented with d-alanine but was unable to grow outside the laboratory, particularly in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells, the natural habitat of this organism during infection. in mice, the double-mutant strain was completely attenuated. nevertheless, it showed the ability, particularly under conditions of transient suppression of the mutant phenotype, to induce cytotoxic t-lymphocyte responses and to generate protective immunity against lethal challenge by wild-type l. monocytogenes equivalent to that induced by the wild-type organism.
surgery for outer ear canal exostoses and osteomata: focusing on patient benefit and health-related quality of life the glasgow benefit inventory (gbi) is a measure of patient benefit developed especially for otorhinolaryngological (orl) interventions. patient benefit is the change in health status resulting from health care intervention. the gbi was developed to be patient-oriented, to be maximally sensitive to orl interventions, and to provide a common metric to compare benefit across different interventions. the gbi is an 18-item, postintervention questionnaire intended to be given to patients to fill in at home or in the outpatient clinic. in the first part of the paper, five different orl interventions were retrospectively studied: middle ear surgery to improve hearing, provision of a cochlear implant, middle ear surgery to eradicate ear activity, rhinoplasty, and tonsillectomy. a criterion that was specific to the intervention was selected for each study, so that the patient outcome could be classified as above and below criterion. in all five interventions, the gbi was found to discriminate between above- and below-criterion outcomes. the second part of the paper reports on the results and implications of a factor analysis of patient responses. the factor structure was robust across the study, and so led to the construction of subscales. these subscales yield a profile score that provides information on the different types of patient benefit resulting from orl interventions. the gbi is sensitive to the different orl interventions, yet is sufficiently general to enable comparison between each pair of interventions. it provides a profile score, which enables further breakdown of results. as it provides a patient-oriented common metric, it is anticipated that the gbi will assist audit, research, and health policy planning.
type 2 rhinovirus infection of cultured human tracheal epithelial cells: role of ldl receptor. we have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) enhances expression of interleukin-6, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor genes in human omental microvascular endothelial (home) cells in culture. in this study, we found that treatment of home cells with tnf-alpha or interleukin-1 (il-1) caused enhanced expression of low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor. a few-fold increase in both ldl binding activity and the receptor mrna levels was observed when home cells were treated with either tnf-alpha or il-1. northern blot analysis showed that cellular expression of ldl receptor gene was significantly increased 12-24 h after exposure to tnf-alpha. no significant changes in the life-span of ldl receptor mrna were observed in untreated and tnf-alpha-treated cells. scatchard analysis showed an increased receptor number for ldl in tnf-alpha-treated cells. parallel to increased ldl binding activity, internalization and degradation of ldl were also increased in home cells treated with tnf-alpha or il-1. tnf-alpha-induced enhancement of ldl receptor gene expression was not observed when cycloheximide was present. cellular mrna level of sp-1 gene was increased about 3-4-fold at 12 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription of ldl receptor gene as well as sp-1 gene by tnf-alpha. gel retardation assay with the sp-1 consensus fragment showed that sp-1 binding activity was increased about 4-5-fold 12-24 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nf-kb binding activity was also dramatically increased, but there is no nf-kb motif on the promoter for ldl receptor gene. the induction of ldl receptor by tnf might be mediated through a transcription factor, sp-1.
impact of asymmetric male and female gamete dispersal on allelic diversity and spatial genetic structure in valley oak (quercus lobata née) the spatial pattern of established seedlings yields valuable information about variation in fecundity, dispersal, and spatial structure of distributed recruits, but separating maternal and paternal contributions in monoecious species has been hampered by the "2 parent" problem. it is now possible to determine the maternal parentage of established recruits with genetic assay of maternally derived tissues of the seed or fruit, but the dna of weathered maternal tissues often yields unreliable genotypes, reducing the practical range of such assay. we develop a mixed assay of seedling and seed (pericarp) tissues and illustrate it with distributed recruits of california valley oak (quercus lobata née). detailed analysis indicates correct maternal assignment rates of canopy patch recruits of 56% (seedling assay only) versus 94% (mixed assay). for open patch recruits, maternal assignment rates were less than 50% (seedling assay only) versus 91% (mixed assay). the strategy of choice is to use seedling genotypes to identify a small set of credible parental candidates and then deploy 3-4 well-chosen pericarp/endocarp loci to reduce that list to a single obvious maternal candidate. the increase in the number of recruits available for subsequent analysis is pronounced, increasing precision and statistical power for subsequent inference.
design of multi-sampling period delay stabilizing controllers for nonlinear sampled-data systems given a parameterized (by sampling period t) family of approximate discrete-time models of a sampled nonlinear plant and given a family of controllers stabilizing the family of plant models for all t sufficiently small, we present conditions which guarantee that the same family of controllers semi-globally practically stabilizes the exact discrete-time model of the plant for sufficiently small sampling periods. when the family of controllers is locally bounded, uniformly in the sampling period, the inter-sample behavior can also be uniformly bounded so that the (time-varying) sampled-data model of the plant is uniformly semi-globally practically stabilized. the result justifies controller design for sampled-data nonlinear systems based on the approximate discrete-time model of the system when sampling is sufficiently fast and the conditions we propose are satisfied. our analysis is applicable to a wide range of time-discretization schemes and general plant models.
vagal activity is quadratically related to prosocial traits, prosocial emotions, and observer perceptions of prosociality. this paper focuses on pragmatic issues in obtaining measures of cardiac vagal control, and overviews a set of freely available software tools for obtaining several widely used metrics that putatively reflect sympathetic and/or parasympathetic contributions to cardiac chronotropy. after an overview of those metrics, and a discussion of potential confounds and extraneous influences, an empirical examination of the relationships amongst these metrics is provided. this study examined 10 metrics in 96 unselected college students under conditions of resting baseline and serial paced arithmetic. intercorrelations between metrics were very high. factor analyses were conducted on the metrics reflecting variability in cardiac rate, once at baseline and again during mental arithmetic. factor structure was highly stable across tasks, and included a factor that had high loadings of all variables except toichi's "cardiac sympathetic index" (csi), and a second factor that was defined predominantly by the csi. although generally highly correlated, the various metrics responded differently under challenge.
a physical map for the amborella trichopoda genome sheds light on the evolution of angiosperm genome structure the abc model of floral organ identity is based on studies of arabidopsis and antirrhinum, both of which are highly derived eudicots. most of the genes required for the abc functions in arabidopsis and antirrhinum are members of the mads-box gene family, and their orthologs are present in all major angiosperm lineages. although the eudicots comprise 75% of all angiosperms, most of the diversity in arrangement and number of floral parts is actually found among basal angiosperm lineages, for which little is known about the genes that control floral development. to investigate the conservation and divergence of expression patterns of floral mads-box genes in basal angiosperms relative to eudicot model systems, we isolated several floral mads-box genes and examined their expression patterns in representative species, including amborella (amborellaceae), nuphar (nymphaeaceae) and illicium (austrobaileyales), the successive sister groups to all other extant angiosperms, plus magnolia and asimina, members of the large magnoliid clade. our results from multiple methods (relative-quantitative rt-pcr, real-time pcr and rna in situ hybridization) revealed that expression patterns of floral mads-box genes in basal angiosperms are broader than those of their counterparts in eudicots and monocots. in particular, (i) ap1 homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and leaves, (ii) ap3/pi homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and (iii) ag homologs are expressed in stamens and carpels of most basal angiosperms, in agreement with the expectations of the abc model; however, an ag homolog is also expressed in the tepals of illicium. the broader range of strong expression of ap3/pi homologs is inferred to be the ancestral pattern for all angiosperms and is also consistent with the gradual morphological intergradations often observed between adjacent floral organs in basal angiosperms.
trust and distrust across coalitions-shapley value centrality measures for signed networks in this paper, we consider the problem of selecting, for any given positive integer k, the top-k nodes in a social network, based on a certain measure appropriate for the social network. this problem is relevant in many settings such as analysis of co-authorship networks, diffusion of information, viral marketing, etc. however, in most situations, this problem turns out to be np-hard. the existing approaches for solving this problem are based on approximation algorithms and assume that the objective function is sub-modular. in this paper, we propose a novel and intuitive algorithm based on the shapley value, for efficiently computing an approximate solution to this problem. our proposed algorithm does not use the sub-modularity of the underlying objective function and hence it is a general approach. we demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm using a co-authorship data set from e-print arxiv (www.arxiv.org), having 8361 authors.
discriminant feature extraction for image recognition using complete robust maximum margin criterion linear discriminant analysis (lda) is an important dimensionality reduction algorithm, but its performance is usually limited on multi-class data. such limitation is incurred by the fact that lda actually maximizes the average divergence among classes, whereby similar classes with smaller divergence tend to be merged in the subspace. to address this problem, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction method called maxi-min discriminant analysis (mmda). in contrast to the traditional lda, mmda attempts to find a low-dimensional subspace by maximizing the minimal (worst-case) divergence among classes. this "minimal" setting overcomes the problem of lda that tends to merge similar classes with smaller divergence when used for multi-class data. we formulate mmda as a convex problem and further as a large-margin learning problem. one key contribution is that we design an efficient online learning algorithm to solve the involved problem, making the proposed method applicable to large scale data. experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the efficacy of our proposed method against five other competitive approaches, and the scalability to the data with thousands of classes.
a novel bankruptcy prediction model based on an adaptive fuzzy k-nearest neighbor method abstract in this paper we evaluate the prediction capability of various neural network models. the models examined in this study differ on the following parameters: data span, learning technique and number of iterations. the neural net prediction capabilities are also compared to results obtained by classical discriminant analysis models. the specific case evaluated is bankruptcy prediction. the common assumption of all bankruptcy prediction models is that fundamental economic factors and the characteristics of a firm are reflected in its financial statements. therefore, using analytic tools and data from the firm's financial reports, one can evaluate and predict its future financial status. since the number of bankrupt firms is limited, we used examples (financial statements) from various periods preceding the bankruptcy event. although the financial statements from the bankruptcy period convey more information, financial statements form distinct periods always improved the models. the prediction capability of the models is improved by using enhanced learning techniques. however, if the enhancement learning technique is too ‘strong’, the model becomes too specific for the training data set and thus loses its prediction capabilities.
genome engineering empowers the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum for biotechnology. diatoms are unicellular photoautotrophic eukaryotes that play an important role in ecology by fixing large amounts of co2 in the oceans. because they evolved by secondary endocytobiosis--a process of uptake of a eukaryotic alga into another eukaryotic cell--they have a rather unusual cell biology and genetic constitution. diatoms are also of biotechnological interest since they produce highly unsaturated fatty acids. in addition they are able to form delicately ornate cell walls made of amorphous silica. understanding and modifying the processes of biomineralization in diatoms might result in new nanotechnological processes. therefore recent advances in molecular genomics and the development of genetic tools for diatoms might pave the way for biotechnological modification and utilization of diatoms. in this chapter i will briefly characterize these extraordinary organisms, give some insights into the actual advances in molecular biology of diatoms and present some examples for the potential future use of diatoms in algal biotechnology.
variation in genes related to hepatic lipid metabolism and changes in waist circumference and body weight abstractthe microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (mtp) is required for the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein b-containing lipoproteins. emerging evidence has indicated that the functional mtp exon polymorphism i128t is associated with dyslipidemia and other traits of the insulin-resistance syndrome, and the t128 variant seems to confer a reduced stability of mtp, resulting in reduced binding of ldl particles. the aim of the study was to elucidate the association of this mtp polymorphism with parameters of postprandial metabolism. a total of 716 male subjects from a postprandially characterized cohort (mick) and a nested case-control study (epic) of 190 incident type 2 diabetes cases and 380 sex- or age-matched controls were genotyped for the i128t exon polymorphism. in comparison to homozygote subjects of the wild allele, carriers of the less common allele of the mtp t128 genotype showed significantly lower postprandial insulin levels (p=0.017), lower diastolic blood pressure (p=0.049) and had a lower prevalence of impaired glucose metabolism and diabetes type 2 (p=0.03) in the mick. consistent with this, we found a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes in male subjects of the nested case-control study in the t128 genotype (p=0.007). these results suggest that the rare allele of the mtp i128t polymorphism may be protective against impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes and other parameters of the metabolic syndrome.
youth development through mentorship: a los angeles school-based mentorship program among latino children the effects and predictors of duration in youth mentor relationships were examined. the study included 1,138 young, urban adolescents (mean age = 12.25”, all of whom applied to big brothers big sisters programs. the adolescents were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group, and administered questions at baseline and 18 months later. adolescents in relationships that lasted a year or longer reported the largest number of improvements, with progressively fewer effects emerging among youth who were in relationships that terminated earlier. adolescents who were in relationships that terminated within a very short period of time reported decrements in several indicators of functioning. older adolescents, as well as those who had been referred for services or had sustained emotional, sexual or physical abuse, were most likely to be in early terminating relationships, as were married volunteers aged 26–30 and those with lower incomes. several dyadic factors were also found to be related to earlier terminations, including race, gender, and relationship quality.
the effects of a chactoid scorpion venom and its purified toxins on rat blood pressure and mast cells histamine release the toxic factors to isopods (crustacea) were isolated from the venom of the chactoid scorpion scorpio maurus palmatus (scorpionidae) by the aid of column chromatography, and their purity was assessed by disc electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, isoelectrofocusing, and amino acid analysis. the toxicity to isopods is attributed to two groups of components: (a) low-molecular-weight basic polypeptides possessing about 3 and 8% of the crude venom lethality and paralytic potency to isopods, respectively. these components are characterized by very similar and unique amino acid compositions of 31 to 34 amino acids with molecular mass of about 3.5 kda and a deficiency in methionine, leucine, phenylalanine, histidine, and tryptophan. (b) toxic phospholipases are also toxic to insect but not to mammals. a lethal phospholipase which contained 37% of the total venom phospholipase activity and 11% of its toxicity to isopods was purified. this phospholipase consists of 125 amino acids (mr 14,581) and is a hydrophobic, acidic protein composed of two isoenzymes (pi 4.7 and 4.9). this enzyme demonstrates an a2-type positional specificity (ec 3.1.1.4) with ph and temperature optima of 7.5-8.0 and 40-50 degrees c, respectively, and high calcium requirements. the lethal potency of the basic polypeptides is evidently increased by the addition of low, sublethal doses of the pure phospholipase. such synergism was not observed with regards to their paralytic activity. the pharmacological significance of these data is discussed.

evidence of segment reassortment in crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever virus. abstract dobrava virus (dobv) occurs in two different rodent species, apodemus flavicollis (dobv-af) and a. agrarius (dobv-aa). we sequenced the s and m genomic segments from sympatric dobv-af and dobv-aa strains which fell into two distinct genetic lineages. molecular phylogenetic analyses gave evidence for genetic reassortment between s and m segments of dobv-af and dobv-aa and indicated homologous recombination events in dobv evolution. dobv-af and dobv-aa are distinct but also subject to genetic exchanges that affect their evolutionary trajectories.
anti‐tumour effects of small interfering rna targeting anion exchanger 1 in experimental gastric cancer the global burden of cancer continues to increase largely because of the aging and growth of the world population alongside an increasing adoption of cancer‐causing behaviors, particularly smoking, in economically developing countries. based on the globocan 2008 estimates, about 12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56% of the cases and 64% of the deaths occurred in the economically developing world. breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer deaths. lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males, comprising 17% of the total new cancer cases and 23% of the total cancer deaths. breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries, a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer. further, the mortality burden for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11% of the total female cancer deaths. although overall cancer incidence rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally similar. cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries, most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and standard treatment. a substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake. clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions globally. ca cancer j clin 2011. © 2011 american cancer society, inc.
efficacy of mechanical bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol in prevention of postoperative complications in elective colorectal surgery: a meta-analysis data extraction: outcomes evaluated were anastomotic leakage, intra-abdominal infection, wound infection, reoperation, and general and extra-abdominal morbidity and mortality rates. data were extracted by 2 independent observers. data synthesis: seven rcts were retrieved. the total number of patients in these rcts was 1297 (642 who had received mbp and 655 who had not). among all the rcts reviewed, anastomotic leak was significantly more frequent in the mbp group, 5.6% (36/642), compared with the no-mbp group, 2.8% (18/655) (odds ratio, 1.84; p=.03). intra-abdominal infection (3.7% for the mbp group vs 2.0% for the no-mbp group), wound infection (7.5% for the mbp group vs 5.5% for the no-mbp group), and reoperation (5.2% for the mbp group vs 2.2% for the no-mbp group) rates were nonstatistically significantly higher in the mbp group. general morbidity and mortality rates were slightly higher in the mbp group.
high rates of fatigue and sleep disturbances in dystonia background: no formal instruments are available for quantifying sleep problems in parkinson’s disease. objective: to develop a new sleep scale to quantify the various aspects of nocturnal sleep problems in parkinson’s disease, which may occur in up to 96% of affected individuals. methods: employing a multidisciplinary team approach, a visual analogue scale was devised addressing 15 commonly reported symptoms associated with sleep disturbance in parkinson’s disease—the parkinson’s disease sleep scale (pdss). in all, 143 patients with parkinson’s disease completed the pdss, covering the entire spectrum of disease from newly diagnosed to advanced stage. as controls, 137 age healthy matched subjects also completed the scale. test–retest reliability was assessed in a subgroup of subjects. the epworth sleepiness scale was also satisfactorily completed by 103 of the patients with parkinson’s disease. results: pdss scores in the parkinson group were significantly different from the healthy controls. patients with advanced parkinson’s disease had impaired scores compared with early/moderate disease. individual items of the scale showed good discriminatory power between parkinson’s disease and healthy controls. relevant items of the pdss correlated with excessive daytime sleepiness. the scale showed robust test–retest reliability. conclusions: this appears to be the first description of a simple bedside screening instrument for evaluation of sleep disturbances in parkinson’s disease. a combination of subitems may help identify specific aspects of sleep disturbance, which in turn may help target treatment.
lazy automata techniques for ws1s jmosel is a tool-set for the analysis and verification of linear parametric systems in monadic second-order logic on strings. in this paper we give a short introduction to the underlying concepts, as well as an overview of the implementation and the usage of jmosel.
functional analysis of novel genetic variation in the thyroid hormone activating type 2 deiodinase. cellular entry of thyroid hormone is mediated by plasma membrane transporters. we have identified rat monocarboxylate transporter 8 (mct8) as an active and specific thyroid hormone transporter. the mct8 gene is located on the x-chromosome. the physiological relevance of mct8 has been demonstrated by the identification of hemizygous mutations in this gene in males with severe psychomotor retardation and elevated serum t(3) levels. we have characterized human (h) mct8 by analysis of iodothyronine uptake and metabolism in cell lines transiently transfected with hmct8 cdna alone or together with cdna coding for iodothyronine deiodinase d1, d2, or d3. mct8 mrna was detected by rt-pcr in a number of human cell lines as well as in cos1 cells but was low to undetectable in other cell lines, including jeg3 cells. mct8 protein was not detected in nontransfected cell lines tested by immunoblotting using a polyclonal c-terminal hmct8 antibody but was detectable in transfected cells at the expected size (61 kda). transfection of cos1 and jeg3 cells with hmct8 cdna resulted in 2- to 3-fold increases in uptake of t(3) and t(4) but little or no increase in rt(3) or 3,3'-diiodothyronine (3,3'-t(2)) uptake. mct8 expression produced large increases in t(4) metabolism by cotransfected d2 or d3, t(3) metabolism by d3, rt(3) metabolism by d1 or d2, and 3,3'-t(2) metabolism by d3. affinity labeling of hmct8 protein was observed after incubation of intact transfected cells with n-bromoacetyl-[(125)i]t(3). hmct8 also facilitated affinity labeling of cotransfected d1 by bromoacetyl-t(3). our findings indicate that hmct8 mediates plasma membrane transport of iodothyronines, thus increasing their intracellular availability.
task-dependent intermuscular motor unit synchronization between medial and lateral vastii muscles during dynamic and isometric squats electromyograms (emgs) are measured by bipolar surface electrodes that quantify potential differences. bipolar potentials over penniform muscles may be associated with errors. our assumption was that muscle activity can be quantified more reliably and with a higher spatial resolution using current measurements. the purpose of this work is: (a) to introduce the concept of current measurements to detect muscle activity, (b) to show the coherences observed over a segment of a typical penniform muscle, the gastrocnemius medialis where one would expect a synchronicity of the activation, and (c) to show the amount of mixing that is caused by the finite inter electrode resistance. a current amplifier was developed. emgs were recorded at 40% of maximum voluntary contraction during isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius medialis. emgs of twelve persons were recorded with an array of four peripheral and one central electrode. monopolar emgs were recorded for "all-potential", "center at current" and "all-current" conditions. coherence revealed the similarity of signals recorded from neighboring electrodes. coherence was high for the "all-potential", significant for the "current at center" condition and disappeared in the "all-current" condition. it was concluded that emg array recordings strongly depends on the measurement configuration. the proposed current amplifier significantly improves spatial resolution of emg array recordings because the inter-electrode cross talk is reduced.
accurate memory data flow modeling in statistical simulation understanding program behavior is at the foundation of computer architecture and program optimization. many programs have wildly different behavior on even the very largest of scales (over the complete execution of the program). this realization has ramifications for many architectural and compiler techniques, from thread scheduling, to feedback directed optimizations, to the way programs are simulated. however, in order to take advantage of time-varying behavior, we must first develop the analytical tools necessary to automatically and efficiently analyze program behavior over large sections of execution.our goal is to develop automatic techniques that are capable of finding and exploiting the large scale behavior of programs (behavior seen over billions of instructions). the first step towards this goal is the development of a hardware independent metric that can concisely summarize the behavior of an arbitrary section of execution in a program. to this end we examine the use of basic block vectors. we quantify the effectiveness of basic block vectors in capturing program behavior across several different architectural metrics, explore the large scale behavior of several programs, and develop a set of algorithms based on clustering capable of analyzing this behavior. we then demonstrate an application of this technology to automatically determine where to simulate for a program to help guide computer architecture research.
food preferences among captive western gorillas (gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (pan troglodytes) we report the results of 2 studies on food-elicited vocalizations in golden lion tamarins (leontopithecus rosalia). first, we investigated the preferences of 10 golden lion tamarins for 6 foods. tamarins prefer mealworms and raisins significantly more than apple, egg, carrot, or marmoset diet. food preference rank was significantly and positively correlated with the rank of latency to choose a particular food. second, we investigated the relation between food preference and 15 vocal parameters measured from the calls emitted by 5 tamarins to a subset of the foods. only 1 parameter was significantly correlated with food preference across animals. within-subjects multivariate analysis of variance showed that the vocalizations to foods are significantly different. our results support an hypothesis that food-elicited vocalizations vary in ways that correspond to the caller's preference but not in a manner that labels food type.
unsupervised learning for document classification : feasibility , limitation , and the bottom line abstract this article introduces adaptive resonance theory 2-a (art 2-a), an efficient algorithm that emulates the self-organizing pattern recognition and hypothesis testing properties of the art 2 neural network architecture, but at a speed two to three orders of magnitude faster. analysis and simulations show how the art 2-a systems correspond to art 2 dynamics at both the fast-learn limit and at intermediate learning rates. intermediate learning rates permit fast commitment of category nodes but slow recoding, analogous to properties of word frequency effects, encoding specificity effects, and episodic memory. better noise tolerance is hereby achieved without a loss of learning stability. the art 2 and art 2-a systems are contrasted with the leader algorithm. the speed of art 2-a makes practical the use of art 2 modules in large scale neural computation.
survey on the use of typological information in natural language processing to facilitate future research in unsupervised induction of syntactic structure and to standardize best-practices, we propose a tagset that consists of twelve universal part-of-speech categories. in addition to the tagset, we develop a mapping from 25 different treebank tagsets to this universal set. as a result, when combined with the original treebank data, this universal tagset and mapping produce a dataset consisting of common parts-of-speech for 22 different languages. we highlight the use of this resource via three experiments, that (1) compare tagging accuracies across languages, (2) present an unsupervised grammar induction approach that does not use gold standard part-of-speech tags, and (3) use the universal tags to transfer dependency parsers between languages, achieving state-of-the-art results.
session based click features for recency ranking we present a general boosting method extending functional gradient boosting to optimize complex loss functions that are encountered in many machine learning problems. our approach is based on optimization of quadratic upper bounds of the loss functions which allows us to present a rigorous convergence analysis of the algorithm. more importantly, this general framework enables us to use a standard regression base learner such as single regression tree for fitting any loss function. we illustrate an application of the proposed method in learning ranking functions for web search by combining both preference data and labeled data for training. we present experimental results for web search using data from a commercial search engine that show significant improvements of our proposed methods over some existing methods.
comparison between supervised and unsupervised learning of probabilistic linear discriminant analysis mixture models for speaker verification many current face recognition algorithms perform badly when the lighting or pose of the probe and gallery images differ. in this paper we present a novel algorithm designed for these conditions. we describe face data as resulting from a generative model which incorporates both within-individual and between-individual variation. in recognition we calculate the likelihood that the differences between face images are entirely due to within-individual variability. we extend this to the non-linear case where an arbitrary face manifold can be described and noise is position-dependent. we also develop a "tied" version of the algorithm that allows explicit comparison across quite different viewing conditions. we demonstrate that our model produces state of the art results for (i) frontal face recognition (ii) face recognition under varying pose.

pleasant for some and unpleasant for others: a protocol analysis of the cognitive factors that influence affective responses to exercise background the intensity of physical activity has been found to be inversely related to adherence, thus contributing to the problem of physical inactivity. although most physical activity is unsupervised and participants, therefore, self-select the intensity, very little is known about the level of intensity that they select. we hypothesized that participants would select, on average, an intensity proximal to the level of transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.   methods twenty-three middle-aged, formerly sedentary women participated in (a) an incremental treadmill test to determine their maximal aerobic capacity and gas exchange ventilatory threshold, an index of the aerobic-anaerobic transition, and (b) a 20-min bout of treadmill exercise during which they were allowed to select the speed.   results on average, but with considerable interindividual variability, the women selected an intensity that, in terms of treadmill speed, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and perceived exertion was no different from the intensity corresponding to their gas exchange ventilatory threshold. moreover, affective valence remained positive and stable.   conclusions on average, middle-aged, formerly sedentary women selected an intensity that is considered physiologically effective and reported that it did not feel hard or unpleasant. future research should examine the sources of interindividual variability and the consequences of exercising at an intensity that exceeds one's preferred level.
quantitative assessment of brain microvascular and tissue oxygenation during cardiac arrest and resuscitation in pigs background return of spontaneous circulation (rosc) is improved by greater vital organ blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). we tested the hypothesis that myocardial flow above the threshold needed for rosc may be associated with greater vital organ injury and worse outcome.   methods aortic and right atrial pressures were measured with micromanometers in 27 swine. after 10 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, chest compression was performed with an automatic, load-distributing band. animals were randomly assigned to receive flows just sufficient for rosc (low flow: target coronary perfusion pressure = 12 mm hg) or well above the minimally effective level (high flow: coronary perfusion pressure = 30 mm hg). myocardial flow was measured with microspheres, defibrillation was performed after 3.5 minutes of cpr, and ejection fraction was measured with echocardiography.   results return of spontaneous circulation was achieved by 9 of 9 animals in the high-flow group and 15 of 18 in the low-flow group. all animals in the high-flow group defibrillated initially into a perfusing rhythm, whereas 12 of 15 animals achieving rosc in the low-flow group defibrillated initially into pulseless electrical activity (p < .05, fisher exact test). compared with animals in the low-flow group, animals in the high-flow group had shorter resuscitation times, higher mean aortic pressures at rosc, and higher ejection fractions at 2 hours post-rosc (all p < .05).   conclusion high-flow cpr significantly improved arrest hemodynamics, rates of rosc, and post-rosc indicators of myocardial status, all indicating less injury with higher flows. no evidence of organ injury from vital organ blood flow substantially above the threshold for rosc was found.
the hepatic foxq1 transcription factor regulates glucose metabolism in mice background & aims missense mutations in human krüppel-like factor 11 (klf11) lead to the development of diabetes, as a result of impaired insulin synthesis in the pancreas. however, the role of klf11 in peripheral tissues is largely unknown. the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of klf11 in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis using different mouse models.   methods adenoviruses expressing klf11 (ad-klf11) or klf11-specific shrna (ad-shklf11) were injected into db/db diabetic, high-fat diet-induced obese (dio), or normal c57bl/6j mice. histological analysis of the fatty liver phenotype and biochemical analysis of hepatic and serum tg levels in these mice were performed. the molecular mechanism by which klf11 regulates lipid metabolism in primary hepatocytes and mouse livers was explored.   results the expression of the transcription factor klf11 gene is dysregulated in the livers of db/db and dio mice. adenovirus-mediated overexpression of klf11 in the livers of db/db and dio mice activates the pparα signaling pathway, subsequently markedly improving the fatty liver phenotype. conversely, knockdown of klf11, by adenovirus (ad-shklf11) in livers of wild type c57bl/6j and db/m mice, increases hepatic triglyceride (tg) levels, owing to decreased fatty acid oxidation. finally, the treatment of diabetic mice with ad-shpparα abolishes klf11 stimulatory effects on the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and inhibitory effects on hepatic tg content. in contrast, pparα rescue restores the increased hepatic tg levels in ad-shklf11-infected db/m mice to normal levels.   conclusions klf11 is an important regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism.
assessment of sexual dysfunction in male patients with ankylosing spondylitis objective after pain and stiffness, one of the most important complaints of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) is disability. the main aims of treatment are to control pain but also to improve function. various methods of assessing function exist but are either not specific for the disease or have not been adequately validated. as a result of this deficiency we developed the bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (basfi) as a new approach to defining and monitoring functional ability in patients with as.   methods this self-assessment instrument was designed by a team of medical professionals in conjunction with patients, and consists of 8 specific questions regarding function in as and 2 questions reflecting the patient's ability to cope with everyday life. each question is answered on a 10 cm horizontal visual analog scale, the mean of which gives the basfi score (0-10). the questionnaire was completed 257 times in total: once by 116 outpatients and by 47 inpatients on 3 occasions over a 3-week intensive physiotherapy course. in addition, the instrument was compared with the dougados functional index.   results patients scores covered 95% of the basfi range, giving a normal distribution of results. in contrast only 65% of the dougados functional index scale was used. furthermore, over the 3 week period of inpatient treatment, the basfi revealed a significant improvement in function (20%, p = 0.004) while there was a less impressive change in the dougados functional index (6%, p = 0.03). this demonstrates the superior sensitivity of the basfi: consistency was good for both indices (p < 0.001), as was the relationship between patient perception of function and function as assessed by an external observer (p < 0.001).   conclusion the basfi satisfies the criteria required of a functional index: it is quick and easy to complete, is reliable and is sensitive to change across the whole spectrum of disease.
outbreak of tsukamurella species bloodstream infection among patients at an oncology clinic, west virginia, 2011-2012. mycobacterium abscessus is an important cause of water-related nosocomial outbreaks or pseudo-outbreaks. strain comparison has relied on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). unfortunately, almost 50% of strains cannot be assessed by this method. we studied 118 strains of m. abscessus previously studied by pfge by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr, including isolates from eight nosocomial outbreaks. ten random primers were evaluated by using dna prepared by boiling or phenol-chloroform extraction. both dna preparations gave the same grouping of isolates for three outbreaks compared to the groupings obtained by pfge. five outbreaks due to m. abscessus which gave broken dna by pfge gave evaluable patterns when studied by rapd-pcr, with isolate clustering being consistent with that from other laboratory and epidemiologic data. the patterns were highly method dependent, strain comparison required the use of multiple primers, and the method worked best with purified dna and by using strains for comparison on the same gel. we propose categories of indistinguishable, different, and inconclusive when comparing strains by rapd-pcr. this study demonstrates that rapd-pcr can be used for genetic comparison of m. abscessus strains, including strains which cannot be compared by pfge, but the potential for misinterpretation is greater than that by pfge.
clinical cancer advances 2013: annual report on progress against cancer from the american society of clinical oncology. purpose anaplastic oligodendroglioma are chemotherapy-sensitive tumors. we now present the long-term follow-up findings of a randomized phase iii study on the addition of six cycles of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (pcv) chemotherapy to radiotherapy (rt).   patients and methods adult patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors were randomly assigned to either 59.4 gy of rt or the same rt followed by six cycles of adjuvant pcv. an exploratory analysis of the correlation between 1p/19q status and survival was part of the study. retrospectively, the methylation status of the methyl-guanine methyl transferase gene promoter and the mutational status of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh) gene were determined. the primary end points were overall survival (os) and progression-free survival based on intent-to-treat analysis.   results a total of 368 patients were enrolled. with a median follow-up of 140 months, os in the rt/pcv arm was significantly longer (42.3 v 30.6 months in the rt arm, hazard ratio [hr], 0.75; 95% ci, 0.60 to 0.95). in the 80 patients with a 1p/19q codeletion, os was increased, with a trend toward more benefit from adjuvant pcv (os not reached in the rt/pcv group v 112 months in the rt group; hr, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.31 to 1.03). idh mutational status was also of prognostic significance.   conclusion the addition of six cycles of pcv after 59.4 gy of rt increases both os and pfs in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. 1p/19q-codeleted tumors derive more benefit from adjuvant pcv compared with non-1p/19q-deleted tumors.
increased intramuscular lipid synthesis and low saturation relate to insulin sensitivity in endurance-trained athletes. hyperinsulinemia is common in obesity, but whether it plays a role in intramyocellular triglyceride (imctg) buildup is unknown. in this study, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments were performed in overnight-fasted lean and high-fat-fed obese rats, awake, to determine the effect of insulin on imctg synthesis (incorporation of [14c]glycerol, [14c]glucose, and [3h]oleate). insulin infusion at 25 (low insulin) and 100 (high insulin) pmol/kg/min increased plasma insulin by 5- and 16-fold, respectively, whereas plasma and intramyocellular glycerol, ffas, triglycerides, and glucose levels were maintained at their basal levels by co-infusion of exogenous glycerol, ffas, and triglycerides at fixed rates and glucose at varying rates. in obese rats, insulin suppressed incorporation of glycerol into the imctg-glycerol moiety dose dependently (p < 0.01–p < 0.001) in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior, but only the high insulin suppressed it in soleus (p < 0.05). the low insulin suppressed glucose incorporation into imctg-glycerol in all three muscles (p = 0.01–p < 0.01). however, the low insulin did not affect (p > 0.05) and the high insulin suppressed (p < 0.05–p < 0.01) fatty acid incorporation into imctg in all three muscles. insulin also suppressed glycerol incorporation in lean rats (p < 0.01–p < 0.04). on the other hand, imctg pool size was not affected by insulin (p > 0.05). these observations suggest that acute hyperinsulinemia inhibits imctg synthesis and thus does not appear to promote imctg accumulation via the synthetic pathway, at least in the short term.
why are male malaria parasites in such a rush? the role of positive darwinian selection in evolution at the molecular level has been keenly debated for many years, with little resolution. however, a recent increase in dna sequence data and the development of new methods of analysis have finally made this question tractable. here, i review the current state-of-play of the field. initial estimates in drosophila suggest that approximately 50% of all amino acid substitutions, and a substantial fraction of substitutions in non-coding dna, have been fixed as a consequence of adaptive evolution. estimates in microorganisms are even higher. by contrast, there is little evidence of widespread adaptive evolution in our own species.
a novel exon in the human ca2+-activated cl- channel ano1 imparts greater sensitivity to intracellular ca2. calcium-dependent chloride channels are required for normal electrolyte and fluid secretion, olfactory perception, and neuronal and smooth muscle excitability. the molecular identity of these membrane proteins is still unclear. treatment of bronchial epithelial cells with interleukin-4 (il-4) causes increased calcium-dependent chloride channel activity, presumably by regulating expression of the corresponding genes. we performed a global gene expression analysis to identify membrane proteins that are regulated by il-4. transfection of epithelial cells with specific small interfering rna against each of these proteins shows that tmem16a, a member of a family of putative plasma membrane proteins with unknown function, is associated with calcium-dependent chloride current, as measured with halide-sensitive fluorescent proteins, short-circuit current, and patch-clamp techniques. our results indicate that tmem16a is an intrinsic constituent of the calcium-dependent chloride channel. identification of a previously unknown family of membrane proteins associated with chloride channel function will improve our understanding of chloride transport physiopathology and allow for the development of pharmacological tools useful for basic research and drug development.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
construct validation of a cost-effective vessel ligation benchtop simulator. open knot‐tying and suturing skills are fundamental surgical skills, founding many alternative knot‐tying techniques. it is therefore mandatory for residents to possess adequate basic open knot‐tying skills. the aim of this study was to compare an objective assessment of open knot‐tying skills by residents to a resident's own estimation of his or her knot‐tying skills, before and after a knot‐tying course.
evolutionary decision rules for predicting protein contact maps the protein superfamilies in the national biomedical research foundation sequence data base cluster into six groups that can be distinguished on the basis of four variables characterizing amino acid composition and local sequence properties. the variables are average hydrophobicity, net charge, sequence length and periodic variation in hydrophobic residues along the chain. the clusters they distinguish are: globins; chromosomal proteins; contractile system proteins and respiratory proteins other than cytochromes; enzyme inhibitors and toxins; enzymes except hydrolases; and all other proteins. the overall probability of correctly allocating a given protein to one of these functional groups is 0.76, with the allocation reliability being highest for globins (0.97) and for chromosomal proteins (0.93).
multigene evidence for the placement of a heterotrophic amoeboid lineage leukarachnion sp. among photosynthetic stramenopiles. polymerase chain reaction conditions were established for the in vitro amplification of eukaryotic small subunit ribosomal (16s-like) rrna genes. coding regions from algae, fungi, and protozoa were amplified from nanogram quantities of genomic dna or recombinant plasmids containing rdna genes. oligodeoxynucleotides that are complementary to conserved regions at the 5' and 3' termini of eukaryotic 16s-like rrnas were used to prime dna synthesis in repetitive cycles of denaturation, reannealing, and dna synthesis. the fidelity of synthesis for the amplification products was evaluated by comparisons with sequences of previously reported rrna genes or with primer extension analyses of rrnas. fewer than one error per 2000 positions were observed in the amplified rrna coding region sequences. the primary structure of the 16s-like rrna from the marine diatom, skeletonema costatum, was inferred from the sequence of its in vitro amplified coding region.
relation between parent psychiatric symptoms and youth problems: moderation through family structure and youth gender the youth self report (ysr) is a widely used measure of youth emotional and behavioral problems. although the ysr was designed for youths ages 11 to 18, no studies have systematically evaluated whether youths younger than age 11 can make valid reports on this measure. this study thus examined the reliability and validity of the ysr scales scores for younger (ages 7–10; n = 184) and older (ages 11–14; n = 147) youths. results demonstrated that younger youths were able to provide reliable reports on the ysr broad band (internalizing, externalizing) scales, though less so on the narrow band scales. across all scales, the externalizing scales performed more favorably than the internalizing scales among both younger and older youth. younger youths’ dsm-oriented scales corresponded significantly with dsm diagnoses.

lack of the canonical prb-binding domain in the e7 orf of artiodactyl papillomaviruses is associated with the development of fibropapillomas. the bioperl project is an international open-source collaboration of biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists that has evolved over the past 7 yr into the most comprehensive library of perl modules available for managing and manipulating life-science information. bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers. the bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. the bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as ensembl, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice perl programmers. bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as blast, clustalw, or the emboss suite. interoperation with modules written in python and java is supported through the evolving biocorba bridge. bioperl provides access to data stores such as genbank and swissprot via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the open bioinformatics database access project. this study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. we conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort.
retracted article: triptolide (tpl) improves locomotor function  recovery in rats and reduces inflammation after spinal cord injury spinal cord injury (sci) results in a pathophysiology characterized by multiple locomotor and sensory deficits, resulting in altered nociception and hyperalgesia. sci triggers an early and prolonged inflammatory response, with increased interleukin‐1β levels. transient changes are observed in subunit populations of the transcription factor nuclear factor‐κb (nf‐κb). there were decreases in neuronal c‐rel levels and inverse increases in p65 and p50 levels. there were no changes in neuronal p52 or relb subunits after sci at any time point tested. similarly, sci had no effect on oligodendroglial levels of any nf‐κb subunit. there were significant early increases in cox‐2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase mrna and protein levels after sci. we used synthetic double‐stranded “decoy” deoxyoligonucleotides containing selective nf‐κb protein dimer binding consensus sequences. decoys targeting the p65/p50 binding site on the cox‐2 promoter decreased sci‐induced cell losses, nf‐κb p65/p50 dna‐binding activity, and cox‐2 and inos protein levels. nf‐κb p65/p50 targeted decoys improved early locomotor recovery after moderate but not severe sci, yet ameliorated sci‐induced hypersensitization after both moderate and severe sci. to determine whether changes in gaba activity played a role in decreased hypersensitivity after sci and p65/p50 targeted decoy, we counted γ‐aminobutyric acid (gaba)‐containing neurons in laminae 1–3. there were significantly more gabaergic neurons in the p65/p50 targeted decoy‐treated group at the level of injury. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
hcap: a history-based capability system for iot devices the constrained application protocol (coap) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. the nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of rom and ram, while constrained networks such as ipv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6lowpans) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. the protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (m2m) applications such as smart energy and building automation. coap provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the web such as uris and internet media types. coap is designed to easily interface with http for integration with the web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.
life expectancy of children in vegetative and minimally conscious states. the authors studied life expectancy and risk factors for mortality of persons in the vegetative state (vs). the study participants were 1,021 california patients in the vs during 1981-1996. because of the large sample size, the authors were able to use multivariate methods to assess the effect of several risk factors on mortality. the authors found a strong secular trend in infant mortality, with rates in the mid-1990s being only one third of those in the early 1980s (p < 0.01). a smaller secular trend was observed for children aged 2-10 years and none for older patients. the mortality risk for older patients fell by approximately 8% for each year since the onset of the vs. the need for gastrostomy feeding was associated with a substantially higher risk, especially for infants and older patients (p < 0.01). ventilator dependence also appeared to be a risk factor. on the basis of recent mortality rates, life expectancy in the vs is frequently higher than has generally been thought. for example, it is 10.5 additional years (+/- 2 years) for a 15-year-old patient who has been in the vs for 1 year, and 12.2 years for a 15-year-old patient who has been in the vs for 4 years.
product approximation by minimizing the upper bound of bayes error rate for bayesian combination of classifiers this paper proposes a simple yet highly accurate system for the recognition or unconstrained handwritten numerals. it starts with an examination of the basic characteristic loci (cl) features used along with a nearest neighbor classifier achieving a recognition rate of 90.5%. we then illustrate how the basic cl implementation can be extended and used in conjunction with a multilayer perception neural network classifier to increase the recognition rate to 98%. this proposed recognition system was tested on a totally unconstrained handwritten numeral database while training it with only 600 samples exclusive from the test set. an accuracy exceeding 98% is also expected if a larger training set is used. lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system its performance is also compared to that of some other common recognition schemes. these systems use moment invariants as features along with nearest neighbor classification schemes.

early streptozotocin-diabetes mellitus downregulates rat kidney at2 receptors. the present studies determined the effect of renal ischemia/reperfusion on components of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system in rats and evaluated the effect of at1 angiotensin (ang) ii receptor blockade on functional recovery. after bilateral renal pedicle occlusion for 60 min, serum creatinine increased, peaking at 72 h, and returned to sham levels after 120 h. ang ii levels in ischemic kidneys were significantly increased 24 h after reperfusion but did not differ from levels in sham kidneys after 120 h. both renal cortical angiotensinogen mrna and proximal tubular at1 receptor mrna were significantly reduced early after reperfusion, returning to sham levels by 120 and 72 h, respectively. at2 ang ii receptor mrna was undetectable in proximal tubules from sham rats but was consistently present in ischemic rats at 120 h. by histoautoradiography, we found that binding of 125i-labeled ang ii was preserved in glomeruli but was decreased in whole cortex and outer medulla early after reperfusion and was completely blocked by the at1 antagonist losartan. treatment of rats with losartan (25 mg/kg s.c. daily), starting at the time of reperfusion, had no effect on expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in cortical tubules but caused a significant decrease in serum creatinine at 72 h (ischemia: 334 +/- 69 microm vs. ischemia + losartan: 135 +/- 28 microm; p < 0.025, n = 6). these data indicate that renal ischemic injury causes an early increase in intrarenal ang ii levels, associated with reduction of mrna for angiotensinogen and proximal tubular at1 receptors, and maintenance of glomerular ang ii binding. losartan accelerates recovery of renal function, suggesting that activation of at1 receptors impairs glomerular filtration in the postischemic kidney.
mediation by nitric oxide of neurogenic relaxation of the urinary bladder neck muscle in sheep. in the present study, nerve mediated functions in the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the female rabbit urethra were characterized. based on light microscopic findings, the interest was focused on the proximal third of the organ. a microsurgical dissection technique was developed, allowing separation of the two muscle layers. the following studies were carried out: functional in vitro investigations including exogenous application of drugs and electrical field stimulation, investigations of the release of 3h-noradrenaline (na), and autoradiography for visualization of muscarinic receptors. the results can be summarized as follows: the adrenergic nervous influence, which was mediated mainly via alpha 1-adrenoceptors, dominated the contractile response of the circular layer and contributed significantly to the contraction of the longitudinal layer. a previously described fast, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic response was found in the circular muscle layer. this response should probably be ascribed to striated muscle with a different innervation and/or structure than skeletal muscle in general. muscarinic cholinoceptors were abundant in the outer parts of the urethral wall and decreased in density in luminal direction. a significant cholinergic contractile component was demonstrated in the longitudinal muscle. a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve-mediated relaxant response was found in both layers, although more pronounced in the circular one. vasoactive intestinal polypeptide completely relaxed both circular and longitudinal preparations contracted by noradrenaline. a possible basis for an interaction between adrenergic and cholinergic nerve endings was demonstrated in the circular muscle layer. stimulation of muscarinic receptors on the adrenergic nerve endings markedly reduced the release of 3h-na. the present results support the findings in previous studies on circularly and longitudinally oriented full-thickness preparations of the female urethra and further underline the differences in structure, innervation and receptor functions between the different muscle layers of the urethral wall.
functional study of two biochemically unusual mutations in gucy2d leber congenital amaurosis expressed via adenoassociated virus vector in mouse retinas retinal degeneration 3 (rd3) protein, essential for normal expression of retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (retgc) in photoreceptor cells, blocks retgc catalytic activity and stimulation by guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (gcaps). in a mouse retina, rd3 inhibited both retgc1 and retgc2 isozymes. photoreceptors in the rd3/rd3 mouse retinas lacking functional rd3 degenerated more severely than in the retinas lacking both retgc isozymes, consistent with a hypothesis that the inhibitory activity of rd3 has a functional role in photoreceptors. to map the potential target-binding site(s) on rd3, short evolutionary conserved regions of its primary structure were scrambled and the mutations were tested for the rd3 ability to inhibit retgc1 and co-localize with the cyclase in co-transfected cells. substitutions in 4 out of 22 tested regions, 87kihp90, 93cgpai97, 99rfrq102, and 119rsvl122, reduced the rd3 apparent affinity for the cyclase 180–700-fold. changes of amino acid sequences outside the lys87–leu122 central portion of the molecule either failed to prevent rd3 binding to the cyclase or had a much smaller effect. mutations in the 93cgpai97 portion of a predicted central α-helix most drastically suppressed the inhibitory activity of rd3 and disrupted rd3 co-localization with retgc1 in hek293 cells. different side chains replacing cys93 profoundly reduced rd3 affinity for the cyclase, irrespective of their relative helix propensities. we conclude that the main retgc-binding interface on rd3 required for the negative regulation of the cyclase localizes to the lys87–leu122 region.
gene co-expression modules as clinically relevant hallmarks of breast cancer diversity motivation identifying genes with bimodal expression patterns from large-scale expression profiling data is an important analytical task. model-based clustering is popular for this purpose. that technique commonly uses the bayesian information criterion (bic) for model selection. in practice, however, bic appears to be overly sensitive and may lead to the identification of bimodally expressed genes that are unreliable or not clinically useful. we propose using a novel criterion, the bimodality index, not only to identify but also to rank meaningful and reliable bimodal patterns. the bimodality index can be computed using either a mixture model-based algorithm or markov chain monte carlo techniques. results we carried out simulation studies and applied the method to real data from a cancer gene expression profiling study. our findings suggest that bic behaves like a lax cutoff based on the bimodality index, and that the bimodality index provides an objective measure to identify and rank meaningful and reliable bimodal patterns from large-scale gene expression datasets. r code to compute the bimodality index is included in the classdiscovery package of the object-oriented microarray and proteomic analysis (oompa) suite available at the web site http;//bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/software/oompa.
cyst wall synthase: n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity is induced to form the novel n-acetylgalactosamine polysaccharide in the giardia cyst wall. homogenates of giardia lamblia trophozoites exhibited the following hydrolase activities: acid phosphatase (ec 3.1.3.2), proteinase (ec 3.1.4) with urea-denatured hemoglobin and n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-naphthylamide as substrates, deoxyribonuclease (ec 3.1.4.5), and ribonuclease (ec 2.7.7.16). beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase (ec 3.2.1.30), beta-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23), beta-glucuronidase (ec 3.2.1.31), alpha-d-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20), beta-d-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.21), and beta-d-xylosidase (ec 3.2.1.37) activities were below the level of detection. differential and isopycnic centrifugation of homogenates demonstrated that giardial hydrolases were localized in a single-particle population sedimenting at 7200g for 30 min. the particles had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.15 and exhibited latency. latency was completely destroyed by triton x-100 or 15 cycles of freezing and thawing. after centrifugation of triton- or freeze-thaw-treated particle fractions, the hydrolase activities, though no longer latent, were still sedimentable suggesting tight binding to the organelle membrane. latency was destroyed simultaneously for all hydrolases, in direct proportion to the amount of triton added to a particle preparation or to the number of times a particle preparation was subjected to freezing and thawing. these results support the suggestion that the hydrolases of g. lamblia trophozoites are localized in a single-particle population of lysosome-like organelles.
sensitivity of landscape resistance estimates based on point selection functions to scale and behavioral state: pumas as a case study the spatial scale at which organisms respond to human activity can affect both ecological function and conservation planning. yet little is known regarding the spatial scale at which distinct behaviors related to reproduction and survival are impacted by human interference. here we provide a novel approach to estimating the spatial scale at which a top predator, the puma (puma concolor), responds to human development when it is moving, feeding, communicating, and denning. we find that reproductive behaviors (communication and denning) require at least a 4× larger buffer from human development than non-reproductive behaviors (movement and feeding). in addition, pumas give a wider berth to types of human development that provide a more consistent source of human interference (neighborhoods) than they do to those in which human presence is more intermittent (arterial roads with speeds >35 mph). neighborhoods were a deterrent to pumas regardless of behavior, while arterial roads only deterred pumas when they were communicating and denning. female pumas were less deterred by human development than males, but they showed larger variation in their responses overall. our behaviorally explicit approach to modeling animal response to human activity can be used as a novel tool to assess habitat quality, identify wildlife corridors, and mitigate human-wildlife conflict.
genetic differences between bradyrhizobium japonicum variant strains contrasting in n2-fixation efficiency revealed by representational difference analysis sequencing of large clones or small genomes is generally done by the shotgun approach (anderson et al. 1982). this has two phases: (1) a shotgun phase in which a number of reads are generated from random subclones and assembled into contigs, followed by (2) a directed, or finishing phase in which the assembly is inspected for correctness and for various kinds of data anomalies (such as contaminant reads, unremoved vector sequence, and chimeric or deleted reads), additional data are collected to close gaps and resolve low quality regions, and editing is performed to correct assembly or base-calling errors. finishing is currently a bottleneck in large-scale sequencing efforts, and throughput gains will depend both on reducing the need for human intervention and making it as efficient as possible. we have developed a finishing tool, consed, which attempts to implement these principles. a distinguishing feature relative to other programs is the use of error probabilities from our programs phred and phrap as an objective criterion to guide the entire finishing process. more information is available at http:// www.genome.washington.edu/consed/consed. html.
pollution biomarkers in the spiny lizard (sceloporus spp.) from two suburban populations of monterrey, mexico here we report the results of a study conducted to elucidate the enzymological characteristics of lizard cholinesterases (ches) in order to use them as potential biomarkers for pesticide exposure. serum and brain tissue of the lizard gallotia galloti were used as che sources and in vitro assays were performed to identify acetylcholinesterase (ache) and butyrylcholinesterase (bche) activities. the ph, substrate concentration, and specificity for che assays as well as the response of serum bche to the reactivating agent pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride (2-pam) were also investigated in order to assess the possibilities of this methodology in biomonitoring programs. by the use of selective substrates and the inhibitor tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide, ache and bche activities were identified in lizard serum, while brain contained solely ache. likewise, butyrylthiocholine iodide was the optimum substrate for determining bche activity and acetylthiocholine iodide for assaying both serum and brain ache activities. the optimal ranges of ph and substrate concentrations were 7.5 to 8.0 and 5 to 10 mm, respectively. serum was incubated with different doses of the organophosphorus (op) compounds dichlorvos and paraoxon and subsequently incubated in the presence of two concentrations of 2-pam (2 x 10(-2) or 2 x 10(-4) m). reactivation rate of phosphorylated bche was related to the degree of inhibition of bche and the dose of 2-pam. it was found that a 90-min incubation time with 2 x 10(-4) m of 2-pam satisfactorily increased the op-inhibited bche activity. the enzymological properties of serum bche activity and its in vitro reactivation in the presence of 2-pam represent the initial justification for its use in monitoring op contamination in the field.
text detection in manga by combining connected-component-based and region-based classifications creating a digital manga comic for mobile devices is chalenging because of the limitation of device's screen size and time consuming of the process. in this paper, we proposed an efficient method for automatically creating mobile content of digital manga comic from scanned of printed digital comic by extracting comic frame, comic balloon and japanese character within a manga comic then recompose it a new mobile content using comicxml to store comic frame content information. experimental results on manga content extraction have 81.6% accuracy of non-flat comic page frame extraction, 100% accuracy of comic balloon detection, and about 93.75% accuracy of japanese character text extraction.
an accurate and efficient experimental approach for characterization of the complex oral microbiota we describe a new molecular approach to analyzing the genetic diversity of complex microbial populations. this technique is based on the separation of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of genes coding for 16s rrna, all the same length, by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dgge analysis of different microbial communities demonstrated the presence of up to 10 distinguishable bands in the separation pattern, which were most likely derived from as many different species constituting these populations, and thereby generated a dgge profile of the populations. we showed that it is possible to identify constituents which represent only 1% of the total population. with an oligonucleotide probe specific for the v3 region of 16s rrna of sulfate-reducing bacteria, particular dna fragments from some of the microbial populations could be identified by hybridization analysis. analysis of the genomic dna from a bacterial biofilm grown under aerobic conditions suggests that sulfate-reducing bacteria, despite their anaerobicity, were present in this environment. the results we obtained demonstrate that this technique will contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity of uncharacterized microbial populations.
stimulation of human cd4+ t lymphocytes via tlr3, tlr5 and tlr7/8 up-regulates expression of costimulatory and modulates proliferation the toll-like receptor (tlr)9 is critical for the recognition of immunostimulatory cpg motifs but may cooperate with other tlrs. we analyzed tlr1–10 mrna expression by using quantitative real-time pcr in highly purified subsets of human pbmc and determined the sensitivity of these subsets to cpg oligodeoxynucleotides (odn). tlr1 and tlr6 were expressed in all cell types examined. tlr10 was highly expressed in b cells and weakly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc). high expression of tlr2 was characteristic for monocytes. pdc and b cells expressed marked levels of tlr7 and tlr9 and were directly sensitive to cpg odn. in cpg odn-stimulated pdc and b cells, tlr9 expression rapidly decreased, as opposed to tlr7, which was up-regulated in pdc and decreased in b cells. in monocytes, nk cells, and t cells, tlr7 was absent. despite low expression of tlr9, monocytes, nk cells, and t cells did not respond to cpg odn in the absence of pdc but were activated in the presence of pdc. in conclusion, our studies provide evidence that pdc and b cells, but not monocytes, nk cells, or t cells, are primary targets of cpg odn in peripheral blood. the characteristic expression pattern of tlr1–10 in cellular subsets of human pbmc is consistent with the concept that tlr9 is essential in the recognition of cpg odn in pdc and b cells. in addition, selective regulation of tlr7 expression in pdc and b cells by cpg odn revealed tlr7 as a candidate tlr potentially involved in modulating the recognition of cpg motifs.
accurate estimation of global and regional cardiac function by retrospectively gated multidetector row computed tomography purpose to evaluate accuracy of cardiac functional analysis with multi-detector row computed tomography (ct) and segmental reconstruction algorithm over a range of heart rates.   materials and methods institutional review board approval was obtained. informed consent was not required. multi-detector row ct (500-msec rotation time, 8 x 1-mm detector collimation) and magnetic resonance (mr) imaging were performed in 50 patients (28 men, 22 women; age range, 46-84 years; mean age, 67 years). two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 41 patients, and electrocardiographically (ecg)-gated single photon emission computed tomography (spect) was performed in 27. end-diastolic volume (edv), end-systolic volume (esv), ejection fraction (ef), and left ventricular (lv) mass were estimated with multi-detector row ct and compared with values estimated with mr imaging, which served as the reference standard. additionally, ef values estimated with multi-detector row ct, echocardiography, and spect were compared with those estimated with mr imaging. systemic error and degree of agreement of global functional parameters measured with mr imaging and other modalities were assessed. in a second analysis, linear regression analysis was added.   results ef estimated with multi-detector row ct agreed and correlated well with ef estimated with mr imaging (bias +/- standard deviation, -1.2% +/- 4.6; r = 0.96). agreement and correlation were similar for edv (-0.35 ml +/- 15.2; r = 0.97), esv (1.1 ml +/- 8.6; r = 0.99), and lv mass (2.5 ml +/- 15.0; r = 0.96). standard deviation of ef difference between multi-detector row ct and mr imaging was significantly less than that between echocardiography and mr imaging (p < .001) or that between spect and mr imaging (p < .001).   conclusion various lv functional parameters were measured with multi-detector row ct with a segmental approach, and measurements correlated and agreed with those obtained with mr imaging. moreover, functional analysis with multi-detector row ct was more accurate than that with two-dimensional echocardiography or ecg-gated spect.
slowed relaxation and preserved maximal force in soleus muscles of mice with targeted disruption of the serca2 gene in skeletal muscle the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium atpase 2 (serca2) transports ca(2+) from cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) of cardiomyocytes, thereby maintaining the store of releasable ca(2+) necessary for contraction. reduced serca function has been linked to heart failure, and loss of serca2 in the adult mammalian heart would be expected to cause immediate severe myocardial contractile dysfunction and death. we investigated heart function in adult mice with an inducible cardiomyocyte-specific excision of the atp2a2 (serca2) gene (serca2 ko). seven weeks after induction of serca2 gene excision, the mice displayed a substantial reduction in diastolic function with a 5-fold increase in the time constant of isovolumetric pressure decay (tau). however, already at 4 weeks following gene excision less than 5% serca2 protein was found in myocardial tissue. surprisingly, heart function was only moderately impaired at this time point. tissue doppler imaging showed slightly reduced peak systolic tissue velocity and a less than 2-fold increase in tau was observed. the sr ca(2+) content was dramatically reduced in cardiomyocytes from 4-week serca2 ko mice, and ca(2+) transients were predominantly generated by enhanced ca(2+) flux through l-type ca(2+) channels and the na(+)-ca(2+) exchanger. moreover, equivalent increases in cytosolic [ca(2+)] in control and serca2 ko myocytes induced greater cell shortening in serca2 ko, suggesting enhanced myofilament responsiveness. our data demonstrate that sr-independent ca(2+) transport mechanisms temporarily can prevent major cardiac dysfunction despite a major reduction of serca2 in cardiomyocytes.
partial evaluation of multi-paradigm declarative languaces: foundations, control, algorithms and efficiency recently well-quasi orders in general, and homeomorphic embedding in particular, have gained popularity to ensure the termination of program analysis, specialisation and transformation techniques. in this paper we investigate and clarify for the first time, both intuitively and formally, the advantages of such an approach over one using well-founded orders. notably we show that the homeomorphic embedding relation is strictly more powerful than a large class of involved well-founded approaches.

time adaptation shows duration selectivity in the human parietal cortex we review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that carry out different attentional functions. one system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. this system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. the other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. this ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.
swimmers, diggers, climbers and more, a study of integration across the mustelids’ locomotor apparatus (carnivora: mustelidae) quantitative shape analysis using geometric morphometrics is based on the statistical analysis of landmark coordinates. many structures, however, cannot be quantified using traditional landmarks. semilandmarks make it possible to quantify two or three-dimensional homologous curves and sur- faces, and analyse them together with traditional landmarks. here we first introduce the concept of sliding semilandmarks and discuss applications and limitations of this method. in a second part we show how the sliding semilandmark algorithm can be used to estimate missing data in incomplete specimens. download the complete "yellow book" on "virtual morphology and evolutionary morphometrics in the new millenium".
automatic sulcal curve extraction with mrf based shape prior this paper presents a new framework for multiple object segmentation in medical images that respects the topological properties and relationships of structures as given by a template. the technique, known as topology-preserving, anatomy-driven segmentation (toads), combines advantages of statistical tissue classification, topology-preserving fast marching methods, and image registration to enforce object-level relationships with little constraint over the geometry. when applied to the problem of brain segmentation, it directly provides a cortical surface with spherical topology while segmenting the main cerebral structures. validation on simulated and real images characterises the performance of the algorithm with regard to noise, inhomogeneities, and anatomical variations
merging multiple sources of information using dissimilarity based approaches we present an algorithm for learning a quadratic gaussian metric (mahalanobis distance) for use in classification tasks. our method relies on the simple geometric intuition that a good metric is one under which points in the same class are simultaneously near each other and far from points in the other classes. we construct a convex optimization problem whose solution generates such a metric by trying to collapse all examples in the same class to a single point and push examples in other classes infinitely far away. we show that when the metric we learn is used in simple classifiers, it yields substantial improvements over standard alternatives on a variety of problems. we also discuss how the learned metric may be used to obtain a compact low dimensional feature representation of the original input space, allowing more efficient classification with very little reduction in performance.
inappropriate medication prescribing in community-dwelling elderly people living in iran context inappropriate medication use is a major patient safety concern, especially for the elderly population. using explicit criteria, prior studies have found that 23.5% and 17.5% of the us community-dwelling elderly population used at least 1 of 20 potentially inappropriate medications in 1987 and 1992, respectively.   objectives to determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use in community-dwelling elderly persons in 1996, to assess trends over 10 years, categorize inappropriate medication use according to explicit criteria, and to examine risk factors for inappropriate medication use.   design, setting, and participants respondents aged 65 years or older (n = 2455) to the 1996 medical expenditure panel survey, a nationally representative survey of the us noninstitutionalized population were included. a 7-member expert panel was convened to categorize inappropriate medications.   main outcome measure prevalence of use of 33 potentially inappropriate medications.   results in 1996, 21.3% (95% confidence interval [ci], 19.5%-23.1%) of community-dwelling elderly patients in the united states received at least 1 of 33 potentially inappropriate medications. using the expert panel's classifications, about 2.6% of elderly patients (95% ci, 2.0%-3.2%) used at least 1 of the 11 medications that should always be avoided by elderly patients; 9.1% (95% ci, 7.9%-10.3%) used at least 1 of the 8 that would rarely be appropriate; and 13.3% (95% ci, 11.7%-14.9%) used at least 1 of the 14 medications that have some indications but are often misused. use of some inappropriate medications declined between 1987 and 1996. persons with poor health and more prescriptions had a significantly higher risk of inappropriate medication use.   conclusions overall inappropriate medication use in elderly patients remains a serious problem. despite challenges in using explicit criteria for assessing inappropriate medications for elderly patients, such criteria can be applied to population-based surveys to identify opportunities to improve quality of care and patient safety. enhancements of existing data sources to include dosage, duration, and indication may augment national improvement and monitoring efforts.
throughput performance evaluation of two-tier tdma for sensor networks in this paper we define a broadcast channel access protocol called spatial tdma, which is designed specifically to operate in a multihop packet radio environment where the location of the nodes of the network is assumed to be fixed. the defined protocol assigns transmission rights to nodes in the network in a local tdma fashion and is collisionfree. methods for determining slot allocations are developed, and an approximate solution is given for determining the assignment of capacities for the links of the network that minimizes the average delay of messages in the system.

immune and stress responses covary with melanin-based coloration in the barn swallow global anthropogenic changes are occurring at an unprecedented rate; one change, human-facilitated introduction of species outside their native range, has had significant ecological and economic impacts. surprisingly, what traits facilitate range expansions post-introduction is relatively unknown. this information could help predict future expansions of introduced species as well as native species shifting their ranges as climate conditions change. here, we asked whether specific behavioural and physiological traits were important in the ongoing expansion of house sparrows (passer domesticus) across kenya. we predicted that birds at the site of initial introduction (mombasa, introduced approx. 1950) would behave and regulate corticosterone, a stress hormone, differently than birds at the range edge (kakamega, approx. 885 km from mombasa; colonized within the last 5 years). specifically, we predicted greater exploratory behaviour and stronger corticosterone response to stressors in birds at the range edge, which may facilitate the identification, resolution and memory of stressors. indeed, we found that distance from mombasa (a proxy for population age) was a strong predictor of both exploratory behaviour and corticosterone release in response to restraint (but only while birds were breeding). these results suggest that certain behavioural and neuroendocrine traits may influence the ability of species to colonize novel habitats.
clinical validation of intravascular ultrasound imaging for assessment of coronary stenosis severity: comparison with stress myocardial perfusion imaging. objectives this study sought to assess the diagnostic efficacy of adenosine technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (spect) in a consecutive series of female patients.   background the utility of adenosine myocardial perfusion spect for the detection of coronary artery disease is not well defined in women because most studies have described a predominantly male population with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease.   methods of the 201 consecutive female patients in the study group who had undergone adenosine tc-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion spect, 130 had coronary angiography within 2 months of the nuclear test, and the other 71 had a low likelihood (<10%, mean [+/-sd] 5 +/- 3%) of coronary artery disease. the spect protocol used separate acquisition of rest thallium-201 and adenosine tc-99m sestamibi and was visually analyzed in 20 segments with a semiquantitative five-point scoring system (0=normal; 4=absent uptake).   results the normalcy rate in patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease was 93% (66 of 71). among the catheterized group, the overall sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of adenosine sestamibi spect for detecting coronary artery disease (> or = to 50% diameter stenosis) were 93% (87 of 94), 78% (28 of 36) and 88% (115 of 130), respectively. in the 103 patients without a prior myocardial infarction, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy were 91% (61 of 67), 78% (28 of 36) and 86% (89 of 103), respectively, for detecting > or = to 50% diameter stenosis. of particular interest, the sensitivity and specificity were as high in patients with nonanginal symptoms (93% and 69%, respectively) as in patients with angina (92% and 83%, respectively, p=ns). the sensitivity and specificity among patients with a relatively low (<25%), intermediate (between 25% and 75%) or high prescan likelihood of coronary artery disease (>75%) were similar: 82% and 82%, 93% and 73%, and 95% and 100%, respectively. the sensitivity and specificity for detecting individual diseased vessels (> or = to 50% diameter stenosis) were, respectively, 76% and 81% for the left anterior descending coronary artery, 44% and 90% for the left circumflex coronary artery and 75% and 77% for the right coronary artery.   conclusions adenosine tc-99m sestamibi spect is an efficient protocol with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease in women irrespective of presenting symptoms or pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease and a high normalcy rate. these findings are of particular clinical relevance because chest pain, anginal or otherwise, has been shown to be a frequent but a less specific marker for coronary artery disease among female patients.
optimized linear, quadratic and cubic interpolators for elementary function hardware implementations describes a table compression method employing finite-precision linear interpolation in reciprocal tables. the interpolation method employs a compressed look-up table and a small-sized multiplier to yield an output reciprocal as a simple direct operation. the leading bits of the arbitrarily precise input are used to index the table, and a limited number of succeeding fractional bits are used to interpolate on the table employing a multiply/add operation. the low-order bits of the product are rounded off so that the output reciprocals are guaranteed to be correct to a unit in the last place and provide a round-to-nearest reciprocal for over 90% of arbitrarily precise input arguments. the interpolation method generates 2k-bit faithful reciprocals employing a k-bits-in, (2k+2)-bits-out table and a (k+3)/spl times/(k+3)-bit multiplier. a single-precision faithful reciprocal can be generated employing a table of size 13 kbytes and a 15/spl times/15-bit multiplier, compared to a table size of 46 mbytes for conventional reciprocal tables. the table and dedicated small multiplier efficiently characterize a functional reciprocator unit with, at most, a 2-cycle latency.
inhibition of semliki forest virus penetration by lysosomotropic weak bases. semliki forest virus was mixed with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine,phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. when the ph of the mixture was dropped to 6 or below, rapid fusion between the membranes of the virus and the liposomes occurred, resulting in the transfer of viral nucleocapsids into the liposomes. fusion was demonstrated biochemically by trapping rnase or trypsin within the liposomes. trapped rnase digested the viral rna into acid-soluble form, providing a simple quantitative assay for fusion. trapped trypsin digested the viral capsid protein. fusion was also demonstrated by electron microscopy as the formation of large vesicles containing viral glycoproteins on the surface and nucleocapsids inside. the efficiency of fusion was 91 +/- 6%. in addition to low ph, it required that the viral glycoproteins be intact. in the target liposomes, cholesterol (but none of the individual phospholipids) was essential. divalent cations were not required. our previous studies with tissue culture cells indicated that the final step in the penetration of the semliki forest virus genome into host cells might involve a fusion event between the membrane of lysosomally trapped viruses and the lysosomal membrane [helenius, a., kartenbeck, j., simons, k. & fries, e. (1980) j. cell biol, 84, 404--420]. the data presented here are fully compatible with this hypothesis.
brain spatial microstates of human spontaneous alpha activity in relaxed wakefulness, drowsiness period, and rem sleep prompted reports of recall of spontaneous, conscious experiences were collected in a no-input, no-task, no-response paradigm (30 random prompts to each of 13 healthy volunteers). the mentation reports were classified into visual imagery and abstract thought. spontaneous 19-channel brain electric activity (eeg) was continuously recorded, viewed as series of momentary spatial distributions (maps) of the brain electric field and segmented into microstates, i.e. into time segments characterized by quasi-stable landscapes of potential distribution maps which showed varying durations in the sub-second range. microstate segmentation used a data-driven strategy. different microstates, i.e. different brain electric landscapes must have been generated by activity of different neural assemblies and therefore are hypothesized to constitute different functions. the two types of reported experiences were associated with significantly different microstates (mean duration 121 ms) immediately preceding the prompts; these microstates showed, across subjects, for abstract thought (compared to visual imagery) a shift of the electric gravity center to the left and a clockwise rotation of the field axis. contrariwise, the microstates 2 s before the prompt did not differ between the two types of experiences. the results support the hypothesis that different microstates of the brain as recognized in its electric field implement different conscious, reportable mind states, i.e. different classes (types) of thoughts (mentations); thus, the microstates might be candidates for the 'atoms of thought'.
improving end-of-turn detection in spoken dialogues by detecting speaker intentions as a secondary task in many streaming speech recognition applications such as voice search it is important to determine quickly and accurately when the user has finished speaking their query. a conventional approach to this task is to declare end-of-query whenever a fixed interval of silence is detected by a voice activity detector (vad) trained to classify each frame as speech or silence. however silence detection and end-of-query detection are fundamentally different tasks, and the criterion used during vad training may not be optimal. in particular the conventional approach ignores potential acoustic cues such as filler sounds and past speaking rate which may indicate whether a given pause is temporary or query-final. in this paper we present a simple modification to make the conventional vad training criterion more closely related to end-of-query detection. a unidirectional long shortterm memory architecture allows the system to remember past acoustic events, and the training criterion incentivizes the system to learn to use any acoustic cues relevant to predicting future user intent. we show experimentally that this approach improves latency at a given accuracy by around 100ms for endof-query detection for voice search.
stable human lymphoblastoid cell lines constitutively expressing hepatitis c virus proteins. hepatitis c virus (hcv) is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis (aih) type 2, which is defined by the presence of type i antiliver kidney microsome autoantibodies directed mainly against cytochrome p450 (cyp)2d6 and by autoreactive liver infiltrating t cells. virus-specific cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) that recognize infected cells and contribute to viral clearance and tissue injury during hcv infection could be involved in the induction of aih. to explore whether the antiviral cellular immunity may turn against self-antigens, we characterized the primary ctl response against an hla-a*0201–restricted hcv-derived epitope, i.e., hcv core 178–187, which shows sequence homology with human cyp2a6 and cyp2a7 8–17. to determine the relevance of these homologies for the pathogenesis of hcv-associated aih, we used synthetic peptides to induce primary ctl responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors and patients with chronic hcv infection. we found that the naive ctl repertoire of both groups contains cross-reactive ctls inducible by the hcv peptide recognizing both cyp2a6 and cyp2a7 peptides as well as endogenously processed cyp2a6 protein. importantly, we failed to induce ctls with the cyp-derived peptides that showed a lower capacity to form stable complexes with the hla-a2 molecule. these findings demonstrate the potential of hcv to induce autoreactive cd8+ ctls by molecular mimicry, possibly contributing to virus-associated autoimmunity.
genome-wide identification and characterization of a dehydrin gene family in poplar (populus trichocarpa) a new method called the neighbor-joining method is proposed for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from evolutionary distance data. the principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (otus [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of otus starting with a starlike tree. the branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, farris's method, sattath and tversky's method, li's method, and tateno et al.'s modified farris method. the new, neighbor-joining method and sattath and tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.
information caching strategy for cyber social computing based wireless networks understanding how users behave when they connect to social networking sites creates opportunities for better interface design, richer studies of social interactions, and improved design of content distribution systems. in this paper, we present a first of a kind analysis of user workloads in online social networks. our study is based on detailed clickstream data, collected over a 12-day period, summarizing http sessions of 37,024 users who accessed four popular social networks: orkut, myspace, hi5, and linkedin. the data were collected from a social network aggregator website in brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple social networks with a single authentication. our analysis of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. additionally, we crawled the social network topology of orkut, so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the social graph. our data analysis suggests insights into how users interact with friends in orkut, such as how frequently users visit their friends' or non-immediate friends' pages. in summary, our analysis demonstrates the power of using clickstream data in identifying patterns in social network workloads and social interactions. our analysis shows that browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. consequently, compared to using only crawled data, considering silent interactions like browsing friends' pages increases the measured level of interaction among users.
relationship between muscle blood flow and oxygen uptake during exercise in endurance-trained and untrained men. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of endurance training on skeletal muscle hemodynamics and oxygen consumption. seven healthy endurance-trained and seven untrained subjects were studied. oxygen uptake, blood flow, and blood volume were measured in the quadriceps femoris muscle group by use of positron emission tomography and [15o]o2, [15o]h2o, and [15o]co during rest and one-legged submaximal intermittent isometric exercise. the oxygen extraction fraction was higher (0.49 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.12; p = 0.017) and blood transit time longer (0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 min; p = 0.04) in the exercising muscle of the trained compared with the untrained subjects. the flow heterogeneity by means of relative dispersion was lower for the exercising muscle in the trained (50 +/- 9%) compared with the untrained subjects (65 +/- 13%, p = 0.025). in conclusion, oxygen extraction is higher, blood transit time longer, and perfusion more homogeneous in endurance-trained subjects compared with untrained subjects at the same workload. these changes may be associated with improved exercise efficiency in the endurance-trained subjects.
involvement of surgical residents in the management of trauma patients in the emergency room: does the presence of an attending physician affect outcomes? background anesthesiology is a vital specialty that permits the safe and humane performance of painful procedures. most israeli anesthesiologists are immigrants, while only a minimal number of israeli medical school graduates enter the specialty. unfortunately, the supply of immigrant physicians is declining due to falling immigration rates.   objectives to examine the current israeli anesthesiology workforce and project future needs.   methods demographic and professional information about israeli hospital anesthesiologists was solicited from anesthesiology department heads. data were also gathered about the past, present and projected future growth, age distribution and birth rate of the israeli population. needs and demand-based analyses were used to project future anesthesiology workforce requirements.   results data on 711 anesthesiologists were obtained from 30 hospital anesthesiology department heads. eighty-seven anesthesiologists (12.2%) graduated from israeli medical schools and 459 (64.6%) graduated from medical schools in the former soviet union. among the 154 anesthesiology residents < or = 40 years old, only 13 (8.4%) graduated from israeli medical schools. there are approximately 10.8 anesthesiologists per 100,000 population. projections for 2005-2015 revealed a need for 250-300 new anesthesiologists.   conclusions the anesthesiology workforce is predominantly composed of immigrants. this has vast implications for the future viability of the specialty because of the continuing reduction in immigration, the lack of interest in the specialty by israeli medical school graduates, and the projected need for many new anesthesiologists to replace retirees and to provide care to a growing and aging population.
making convolutional networks recurrent for visual sequence learning deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. we present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. we explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. we provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. on the imagenet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than vgg nets [40] but still having lower complexity. an ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the imagenet test set. this result won the 1st place on the ilsvrc 2015 classification task. we also present analysis on cifar-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. the depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the coco object detection dataset. deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ilsvrc & coco 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of imagenet detection, imagenet localization, coco detection, and coco segmentation.
kinesthetic mind reader : a method to identify image schemas in natural language context-predicting models (more commonly known as embeddings or neural language models) are the new kids on the distributional semantics block. despite the buzz surrounding these models, the literature is still lacking a systematic comparison of the predictive models with classic, count-vector-based distributional semantic approaches. in this paper, we perform such an extensive evaluation, on a wide range of lexical semantics tasks and across many parameter settings. the results, to our own surprise, show that the buzz is fully justified, as the context-predicting models obtain a thorough and resounding victory against their count-based counterparts.

role of caveolae in the pathogenesis of cholesterol-induced gallbladder muscle hypomotility. caveolin is a 22-kda protein that appears to play a critical role in regulating the cholesterol concentration of caveolae. even though caveolin is thought to be a membrane protein, several reports suggest that this peculiar protein can traffic independently of membrane vesicles. we now present evidence that a cytosolic pool of caveolin is part of a heat-shock protein-immunophilin chaperone complex consisting of caveolin, heat-shock protein 56, cyclophilin 40, cyclophilin a, and cholesterol. treatment of nih 3t3 cells with 1 microm cyclosporin a or 100 nm rapamycin disrupted the putative transport complex and prevented rapid (10-20 min) transport of cholesterol to caveolae. the lymphoid cell line, l1210-jf, does not express caveolin, does not form an immunophilin-caveolin complex, and does not transport newly synthesized cholesterol to caveolae. transfection of caveolin cdna into l1210-jf cells allowed the assembly of a transport complex identical to that found in nih 3t3 cells. in addition, newly synthesized cholesterol in transfected cells was rapidly (10-20 min) and specifically transported to caveolae. these data strongly suggest that a caveolin-chaperone complex is a mechanism by which newly synthesized cholesterol is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum through the cytoplasm to caveolae.
unlabeled data for morphological generation with character-based sequence-to-sequence models we present a novel per-dimension learning rate method for gradient descent called adadelta. the method dynamically adapts over time using only first order information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla stochastic gradient descent. the method requires no manual tuning of a learning rate and appears robust to noisy gradient information, different model architecture choices, various data modalities and selection of hyperparameters. we show promising results compared to other methods on the mnist digit classification task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed cluster environment.
staff and bed distribution in public sector mental health services in the eastern cape province, south africa objective to estimate the shortage of mental health professionals in low- and middle-income countries (lmics).   methods we used data from the world health organization's assessment instrument for mental health systems (who-aims) from 58 lmics, country-specific information on the burden of various mental disorders and a hypothetical core service delivery package to estimate how many psychiatrists, nurses and psychosocial care providers would be needed to provide mental health care to the total population of the countries studied. we focused on the following eight problems, to which who has attached priority: depression, schizophrenia, psychoses other than schizophrenia, suicide, epilepsy, dementia, disorders related to the use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and paediatric mental disorders.   findings all low-income countries and 59% of the middle-income countries in our sample were found to have far fewer professionals than they need to deliver a core set of mental health interventions. the 58 lmics sampled would need to increase their total mental health workforce by 239,000 full-time equivalent professionals to address the current shortage.   conclusion country-specific policies are needed to overcome the large shortage of mental health-care staff and services throughout lmics.
substratum-associated microbiota. flow cytometry offers an easy and powerful way to assess multi-parametric data in different domains, notably in the environmental sciences. because evaluating heterotrophic prokaryotic abundance is crucial to understand an ecosystem's functioning, we propose a quick and efficient protocol for (1) cell's detachment in muddy coastal sediments followed by (2) enumeration of prokaryotes by flow cytometry compared to epifluorescence microscopy and (3) a type of storage adapted for benthic samples. first, sample preparation by incubation in a detergent mix containing sodium pyrophosphate (0.01m final concentration) and tween 80 (0.1% final concentration) drastically increased cell detachment from sediment particles (+130.40%) compared to extraction with sodium pyrophosphate only. cell sorting allowed to control the efficiency of the extraction as few cells were found attached to sediment particles in epifluorescence microscopy after sorting. flow cytometry gave consistent results with strong reliability by counting 1.81 times more cells compared to epifluorescence microscopy. thirdly, results revealed that sediment samples fixed with formaldehyde and then liquid-n2 frozen and directly stored at -80°c can be analyzed within 3months. in routine, our method of extraction and counting allowed to evaluate 83.67% of the real abundance in a sediment sample. finally, this optimized technique was applied on sandy and muddy coastal and freshwater sediments and allowed us to prove the high efficiency of this new method. flow cytometry is a fast, replicable and low-cost method for counting heterotrophic prokaryotes, even for sediment samples. the two-step method that we developed enables high frequency analyses (30 samples in less than 4h).
systolic blood pressure and vascular disease in men aged 65 years and over: the hims (health in men study) objectives: to introduce the western australian health services research linked database as infrastructure to support aetlologic, utilisation and outcomes research. to compare the study population, data resources, technical systems and organisational supports with international best practice in record linkage and health research.
the impact of hospitalization on potentially inappropriate prescribing in an acute medical geriatric division the objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. a weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. the 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12% (181); "1-2", 26% (225); "3-4", 52% (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85% (82). the index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. the percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8% (588); "1", 25% (54); "2", 48% (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59% (18). with each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). in this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). the new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by kaplan and feinstein. the method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.
migraine and attention to visual events during mind wandering gilbert et al. suggest that activity in the default network may be due to the emergence of stimulus-oriented rather than stimulus-independent thought. although both kinds of thought likely emerge during familiar tasks, we argue—and report data suggesting—that stimulus-independent thought dominates unconstrained cognitive periods.
a music-related quality of life measure to guide music rehabilitation for adult cochlear implant users. abstract this study was undertaken to evaluate the musical sounds in cochlear implants (music) perception test, created to assess the music-listening abilities of cochlear implant (ci) users. thirty-one unilateral med-el combi 40+/pulsarci100 users and a control group of 67 adults with normal hearing (nh) participated. the music test comprises six objective and two subjective modules employing approximately 2800 musical files recorded from non-synthesized instruments. a subset was used for comparing ci and nh participants’ results. ci and nh participants performed significantly differently on: pitch discrimination, melody discrimination, chord discrimination, instrument detection, and instrument identification. no significant difference in performance was seen on the subtests of rhythm discrimination or dissonance rating and emotion rating. the music test was found to be a valuable tool for assessing music perception in ci users and nh participants, whether investigating one aspect of music perception in depth or conducting a broad survey of music perception.
impact of glyphosate application to transgenic roundup ready ® soybean on horizontal gene transfer of the epsps gene to bradyrhizobium japonicum and on the root-associated bacterial community summarynaturally occurring horizontal gene transfers between nonviral organisms are difficult to prove. only with the availability of sequence data from a wide variety of organisms can a convincing case be made. in the case of putative gene transfers between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the minimum requirements for inferring such an event include (1) sequences of the transferred gene or its product from several appropriately divergent eukaryotes and several prokaryotes, and (2) a similar set of sequences from the same (or closely related organisms) for another gene or genes. given these criteria, we believe that a strong case can be made forescherichia coli having acquired a second glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene from some eukaryotic host. ancillary observations on the general rate of change and the time of the prokaryote-eukaryote divergence support the notion.
linguistic database summaries using fuzzy logic: towards a human-consistent data mining tool we present the use of fuzzy logic for the derivation of linguistic summaries of data (databases) for providing efficient and human consistent means for the analysis of large amounts of data to be used for a more realistic business decision support. we concentrate on the issue of how to measure the goodness of a linguistic summary, and on how to embed data summarization within the fuzzy querying environment, for an effective and efficient computer implementation. finally, we present an implementation for deriving linguistic summaries of a sales database at a small-to-medium size computer retailer. by analyzing the linguistic summaries obtained we indicate how they can help make decisions by the business owner.
back to basics – the influence of dna extraction and primer choice on phylogenetic analysis of activated sludge communities standardization of dna extraction is a fundamental issue of fidelity and comparability in investigations of environmental microbial communities. commercial kits for soil or feces are often adopted for studies of activated sludge because of a lack of specific kits, but they have never been evaluated regarding their effectiveness and potential biases based on high throughput sequencing. in this study, seven common dna extraction kits were evaluated, based on not only yield/purity but also sequencing results, using two activated sludge samples (two sub-samples each, i.e. ethanol-fixed and fresh, as-is). the results indicate that the bead-beating step is necessary for dna extraction from activated sludge. the two kits without the bead-beating step yielded very low amounts of dna, and the least abundant operational taxonomic units (otus), and significantly underestimated the gram-positive actinobacteria, nitrospirae, chloroflexi, and alphaproteobacteria and overestimated gammaproteobacteria, deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and the rare phyla whose cell walls might have been readily broken. among the other five kits, fastdna@ spin kit for soil extracted the most and the purest dna. although the number of total otus obtained using this kit was not the highest, the abundant otus and abundance of actinobacteria demonstrated its efficiency. the three mobio kits and one zr kit produced fair results, but had a relatively low dna yield and/or less actinobacteria-related sequences. moreover, the 50 % ethanol fixation increased the dna yield, but did not change the sequenced microbial community in a significant way. based on the present study, the fastdna spin kit for soil is recommended for dna extraction of activated sludge samples. more importantly, the selection of the dna extraction kit must be done carefully if the samples contain dominant lysing-resistant groups, such as actinobacteria and nitrospirae.
next-generation linkage and association methods applied to hypertension: a multifaceted approach to the analysis of sequence data we have completed a second-generation linkage map that incorporates sequence-based positional information. this new map, the rutgers map v.2, includes 28,121 polymorphic markers with physical positions corroborated by recombination-based data. sex-averaged and sex-specific linkage map distances, along with confidence intervals, have been estimated for all map intervals. in addition, a regression-based smoothed map is provided that facilitates interpolation of positions of unmapped markers on this map. with nearly twice as many markers as our first-generation map, the rutgers map continues to be a unique and comprehensive resource for obtaining genetic map information for large sets of polymorphic markers.
quadratic regularization with cubic descent for unconstrained optimization ∗ in this work we propose a class of quasi-newton methods to minimize a twice differentiable function with lipschitz continuous hessian. these methods are based on the quadratic regularization of newton’s method, with algebraic explicit rules for computing the regularizing parameter. the convergence properties of this class of methods are analysed. we show that if the sequence generated by the algorithm converges then its limit point is stationary. we also establish local quadratic convergence in a neighborhood of a stationary point with positive definite hessian. encouraging numerical experiments are presented.
amino-acid substitutions in the ikap gene product significantly increase risk for bronchial asthma in children study of very closely linked dna variants at various loci has frequently shown linkage disequilibrium. we studied three closely linked rflps at the apolipoprotein ai-ciii locus. two variants detected by mspi and ssti were in strong linkage disequilibrium; but when conventional statistical tests were used, a third variant (psti), located between the mspi and ssti markers, appeared to be in linkage equilibrium with these two "outside" markers. similar discrepancies from the expected monotone relationship between physical distance and linkage disequilibrium have been reported by others. to investigate these discrepancies, the power to detect linkage disequilibrium was calculated. it could be shown that, for the gene frequencies encountered, very large sample sizes would be required to demonstrate negative (i.e., repulsion-phase) linkage disequilibrium. such numbers are usually very difficult to attain in human studies. failure to demonstrate linkage disequilibrium by conventional methods therefore does not imply its absence. appropriate nomograms and tables are provided.
molecular characterization of a putative heat shock protein cognate gene in rhynchosciara americana the fluorescence-based real-time reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) is widely used for the quantification of steady-state mrna levels and is a critical tool for basic research, molecular medicine and biotechnology. assays are easy to perform, capable of high throughput, and can combine high sensitivity with reliable specificity. the technology is evolving rapidly with the introduction of new enzymes, chemistries and instrumentation. however, while real-time rt-pcr addresses many of the difficulties inherent in conventional rt-pcr, it has become increasingly clear that it engenders new problems that require urgent attention. therefore, in addition to providing a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in real-time rt-pcr, this review has an additional aim: it will describe and discuss critically some of the problems associated with interpreting results that are numerical and lend themselves to statistical analysis, yet whose accuracy is significantly affected by reagent and operator variability.
sis: an r package for sure independence screening in ultrahigh-dimensional statistical models variable selection in high-dimensional space characterizes many contemporary problems in scientific discovery and decision making. many frequently-used techniques are based on independence screening; examples include correlation ranking (fan and lv, 2008) or feature selection using a two-sample t-test in high-dimensional classification (tibshirani et al., 2003). within the context of the linear model, fan and lv (2008) showed that this simple correlation ranking possesses a sure independence screening property under certain conditions and that its revision, called iteratively sure independent screening (isis), is needed when the features are marginally unrelated but jointly related to the response variable. in this paper, we extend isis, without explicit definition of residuals, to a general pseudo-likelihood framework, which includes generalized linear models as a special case. even in the least-squares setting, the new method improves isis by allowing feature deletion in the iterative process. our technique allows us to select important features in high-dimensional classification where the popularly used two-sample t-method fails. a new technique is introduced to reduce the false selection rate in the feature screening stage. several simulated and two real data examples are presented to illustrate the methodology.
novel high-resolution temperature probe for radiofrequency dosimetry. the objective of this study was to develop, optimize, and characterize a flexible and reliable unit for standardized and well-controlled electromagnetic-field exposure of cells in vitro. the technical requirements were high peak and time-averaged exposure of the cells with a minimal temperature rise for the cell cultures, flexible modulation schemes, high uniformity, and low variability of exposure, as well as support of blinded protocols. the developed setup is based on two r18 waveguides resonant at 1800 mhz and operated with a computer-controlled signal and monitoring unit. the cells can be exposed in 35-mm petri dishes either cultivated as monolayers or in suspension. for cell monolayers, the system provides an efficiency for the specific absorption rate (sar) of >50 (w/kg)/w input power, a nonuniformity of the sar distribution of <30%, sar variability of <6%, and a temperature rise of <0.03/spl deg/c/(w/kg) average sar. for cell suspensions and provided that the cells are not in the meniscus area, a sar efficiency of >10 (w/kg)/w, nonuniformity of <40%, sar variability of <17%, and a temperature rise of <0.13/spl deg/c/(w/kg) is achieved. the numerical dosimetry for the field and temperature distributions within the petri dishes was verified using e-field and temperature probes. the temperature analysis has shown that the possibility of localized "hot spots" can be excluded.
effects of rotational energy relaxation in a modular particle-continuum method numerical simulations of axisymmetric flows over reentry configurations at hypersonic conditions using a navier-stokes solver are presented. the navier-stokes equations are modified using park’s two-temperature model to account for thermochemical nonequilibrium and weak ionization eects. the finite-volume method is used to solve the set of dierential equations. the code has the capability to handle any mixture of hexahedra, tetrahedra, prisms and pyramids in 3d or triangles and quadrilaterals in 2d. the results in this paper only use quadrilaterals. numerical fluxes between the cells are discretized using a modified steger-warming flux vector splitting approach which has low dissipation and is appropriate to calculate boundary layers. a point or line implicit method is used to perform the time integration. pressure, heat transfer rates and electron number density profiles are compared to available experimental and flight measurements.
modelling the common ground for discourse particles this paper describes the bridge system, a system designed to robustly map from natural language sentences to abstract knowledge representations. the system runs on parc’s parser, generator, and ordered rewrite platform xle. the bridge system has been extended to include a type of light inference, based on an entailment and contradiction detection algorithm which also runs on xle. the paper then describes a search and question answering application, asker, which uses the bridge system to create a semantic index of text passages and which allows a user to query the index in natural language.
acute reduction of anandamide‐hydrolase (faah) activity is coupled with a reduction of nociceptive pathways facilitation in medication‐overuse headache subjects after withdrawal treatment the flexion or flexor reflex (fr) recorded in the lower limbs in humans (llfr) is a widely investigated neurophysiological tool. it is a polysynaptic and multisegmental spinal response that produces a withdrawal of the stimulated limb and resembles (having several features in common) the hind-paw fr in animals. the fr, in both animals and humans, is mediated by a complex circuitry modulated at spinal and supraspinal level. at rest, the llfr (usually obtained by stimulating the sural/tibial nerve and by recording from the biceps femoris/tibial anterior muscle) appears as a double burst composed of an early, inconstantly present component, called the rii reflex, and a late, larger and stable component, called the riii reflex. numerous studies have shown that the afferents mediating the rii reflex are conveyed by large-diameter, low-threshold, non-nociceptive a-beta fibers, and those mediating the riii reflex by small-diameter, high-threshold nociceptive a-delta fibers. however, several afferents, including nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers from skin and muscles, have been found to contribute to llfr activation. since the threshold of the riii reflex has been shown to correspond to the pain threshold and the size of the reflex to be related to the level of pain perception, it has been suggested that the riii reflex might constitute a useful tool to investigate pain processing at spinal and supraspinal level, pharmacological modulation and pathological pain conditions. as stated in efns guidelines, the riii reflex is the most widely used of all the nociceptive reflexes, and appears to be the most reliable in the assessment of treatment efficacy. however, the riii reflex use in the clinical evaluation of neuropathic pain is still limited. in addition to its nocifensive function, the llfr seems to be linked to posture and locomotion. this may be explained by the fact that its neuronal circuitry, made up of a complex pool of interneurons, is interposed in motor control and, during movements, receives both peripheral afferents (flexion reflex afferents, fras) and descending commands, forming a multisensorial feedback mechanism and projecting the output to motoneurons. llfr excitability, mediated by this complex circuitry, is finely modulated in a state- and phase-dependent manner, rather as we observe in the fr in animal models. several studies have demonstrated that llfr excitability may be influenced by numerous physiological conditions (menstrual cycle, stress, attention, sleep and so on) and pathological states (spinal lesions, spasticity, wallenberg's syndrome, fibromyalgia, headaches and so on). finally, the llfr is modulated by several drugs and neurotransmitters. in summary, study of the llfr in humans has proved to be an interesting functional window onto the spinal and supraspinal mechanisms of pain processing and onto the spinal neural control mechanisms operating during posture and locomotion.
association between physical activity, sedentary time, and healthy fitness in youth. the authors' aim in this cross-sectional study was to characterize levels of objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time in adolescents from 9 european countries. the study comprised 2,200 european adolescents (1,184 girls) participating in the helena cross-sectional study (2006-2008). physical activity was measured by accelerometry and was expressed as average intensity (counts/minute) and amount of time (minutes/day) spent engaging in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (mvpa). time spent in sedentary behaviors was also objectively measured. cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by means of the 20-m shuttle run test. level of maternal education was reported by the adolescents. a higher proportion of boys (56.8% of boys vs. 27.5% of girls) met the physical activity recommendations of at least 60 minutes/day of mvpa. adolescents spent most of the registered time in sedentary behaviors (9 hours/day, or 71% of the registered time). both average intensity and mvpa were higher in adolescents with high cardiorespiratory fitness, and sedentary time was lower in the high-fitness group. there were no physical activity or sedentary time differences between maternal education categories. these data provide an objective measure of physical activity and amount of time spent in sedentary behaviors in a relatively large number of european adolescents.
advanced pseudomyxoma peritonei requiring gastrectomy to achieve complete cytoreduction results in good long-term oncologic outcomes pseudomyxoma peritonei (pmp) is a complex disease with unique biological behavior that usually arises from appendiceal mucinous neoplasia. the classification of pmp and its primary appendiceal neoplasia is contentious, and an international modified delphi consensus process was instigated to address terminology and definitions. a classification of mucinous appendiceal neoplasia was developed, and it was agreed that “mucinous adenocarcinoma” should be reserved for lesions with infiltrative invasion. the term “low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm” was supported and it was agreed that “cystadenoma” should no longer be recommended. a new term of “high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm” was proposed for lesions without infiltrative invasion but with high-grade cytologic atypia. serrated polyp with or without dysplasia was preferred for tumors with serrated features confined to the mucosa with an intact muscularis mucosae. consensus was achieved on the pathologic classification of pmp, defined as the intraperitoneal accumulation of mucus due to mucinous neoplasia characterized by the redistribution phenomenon. three categories of pmp were agreed—low grade, high grade, and high grade with signet ring cells. acellular mucin should be classified separately. it was agreed that low-grade and high-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei should be considered synonymous with disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis and peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis, respectively. a checklist for the pathologic reporting of pmp and appendiceal mucinous neoplasms was also developed. by adopting the classifications and definitions that were agreed, different centers will be able to use uniform terminology that will allow meaningful comparison of their results.
the f-box protein acre189/acif1 regulates cell death and defense responses activated during pathogen recognition in tobacco and tomato[w] the tomato cf-9 gene confers resistance to races of the fungal pathogen cladosporium fulvum expressing the avr9 gene. cdna amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to display transcripts whose expression is rapidly altered during the avr9- and cf-9–mediated defense response in tobacco cell cultures. diphenyleneiodonium was used to abolish the production of active oxygen species during gene induction. of 30,000 fragments inspected, 290 showed altered abundance, of which 263 were induced independently of active oxygen species. cdna clones were obtained for 13 acre (for avr9/cf-9 rapidly elicited) genes. acre gene induction occurred in the presence of cycloheximide. avr9 induced acre gene expression in leaves. surprisingly, acre genes were also rapidly but transiently induced in leaves in response to other stresses. the amino acid sequences of some acre proteins are homologous to sequences of known proteins such as ethylene response element binding protein transcription factors, the n resistance protein, a calcium binding protein, 13-lipoxygenase, and a ring-h2 zinc finger protein. rapid induction of acre genes suggests that they play a pivotal role during plant defense responses.
comparison between anterior cervical discectomy with fusion and anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a meta-analysis introductionthere is considerable controversy as to which technique is best option for reconstruction after multilevel anterior decompression for cervical spondylosis. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic results and complications of anterior cervical discectomy fusion (acdf) and anterior cervical corpectomy fusion (accf) in the treatment of multi-level cervical spondylosis.methodwe reviewed and analyzed papers published from jan 1969 to dec 2010 regarding the comparison of acdf and accf for multilevel cervical spondylosis. statistical comparisons were made when appropriate.resultstwelve studies were included in this systematic review. blood loss was greater for accf compared with acdf. similarly, the rate of graft dislodgement in accf was higher than that in acdf. nonunion rates were 18.4% for 2-level acdf and 37.3% for 3-level acdf, whereas nonfusion rates were 5.1% for single-level accf and 15.2% for 2-level accf. in addition, nonunion rates for three disc levels fused were much higher than that for two disc levels fused, regardless of discectomy or corpectomy. clinical outcome was compared between acdf and accf in nine studies. of these, similar outcome was found between acdf and accf in six studies, whereas three studies reported better outcome in accf compared with acdf.conclusionnonunion rates of acdf are higher than those of accf for multilevel cervical spondylosis. sometimes, clinical outcome of accf was better than acdf for multilevel cervical spondylosis.
gender classification from iris images using fusion of uniform local binary patterns iris is claimed to be one of the best biometrics. we have collected a large data set of iris images, intentionally sampling a range of quality broader than that used by current commercial iris recognition systems. we have re-implemented the daugman-like iris recognition algorithm developed by masek. we have also developed and implemented an improved iris segmentation and eyelid detection stage of the algorithm, and experimentally verified the improvement in recognition performance using the collected dataset. compared to masek's original segmentation approach, our improved segmentation algorithm leads to an increase of over 6% in the rank-one recognition rate.

effects of negative emotions and life events on women's missed miscarriage context the notion that abortion causes poor mental health has gained traction, even though it is not supported by research. few studies have comprehensively investigated women's postabortion emotions.   methods baseline data from a longitudinal study of women seeking abortion at 30 u.s. facilities between 2008 and 2010 were used to examine emotions among 843 women who received an abortion just prior to the facility's gestational age limit, were denied an abortion because they presented just beyond the gestational limit or obtained a first-trimester abortion. multivariable analyses were used to compare women's emotions about their pregnancy and about their receipt or denial of abortion after one week, and to identify variables associated with experiencing primarily negative emotions postabortion.   results compared with women who obtained a near-limit abortion, those denied the abortion felt more regret and anger (scoring, on average, 0.4-0.5 points higher on a 0-4 scale), and less relief and happiness (scoring 1.4 and 0.3 points lower, respectively). among women who had obtained the abortion, the greater the extent to which they had planned the pregnancy or had difficulty deciding to seek abortion, the more likely they were to feel primarily negative emotions (odds ratios, 1.2 and 2.5, respectively). most (95%) women who had obtained the abortion felt it was the right decision, as did 89% of those who expressed regret.   conclusions difficulty with the abortion decision and the degree to which the pregnancy had been planned were most important for women's postabortion emotional state. experiencing negative emotions postabortion is different from believing that abortion was not the right decision.
thyroid hormone downregulates the expression and function of sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated cam kinase ii in the rabbit heart. presently, the only therapy for ventricular fibrillation is delivery of high-voltage shocks. despite "successful defibrillation," patients may have poor cardiac contractility, the mechanisms of which are unknown. intracellular ca2+ handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) plays a major role in contractility. we tested the hypothesis that defibrillation shocks interfere with ca2+ transport function of cardiac sr. rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium had bilateral electrodes implanted subcutaneously for transthoracic shocks. a series of 10 shocks, 10 s apart, at 0-250 v was delivered from a trapezoidal defibrillator. the hearts were rapidly removed, sr-enriched membrane vesicles were isolated, and atp-dependent ca2+ uptake and ca2+-stimulated atp hydrolysis were determined. there was a marked, shock-related decline in ca2+ uptake, whereas adenosinetriphosphatase activity remained unaltered. the polypeptide compositions were similar in control and shocked sr. in langendorff hearts, shocks also decreased contractility and slowed relaxation. these data indicate that shocks with current densities similar to defibrillation depress ca2+-pumping function of cardiac sr because of uncoupling of atp hydrolysis and ca2+ transport. shock-induced impairment of ca2+ pump function may underlie postshock myocardial dysfunction.
what exactly do students learn when they practice equation solving?: refining knowledge components with the additive factors model student modeling plays a critical role in developing and improving instruction and instructional technologies. we present a technique for automated improvement of student models that leverages the datashop repository, crowd sourcing, and a version of the learning factors analysis algorithm. we demonstrate this method on eleven educational technology data sets from intelligent tutors to games in a variety of domains from math to second language learning. in at least ten of the eleven cases, the method discovers improved models based on better test-set prediction in cross validation. the improvements isolate flaws in the original student models, and we show how focused investigation of flawed parts of models leads to new insights into the student learning process and suggests specific improvements for tutor design. we also discuss the great potential for future work that substitutes alternative statistical models of learning from the edm literature or alternative model search algorithms.
granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution the distribution of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation was studied in control autopsy and temporal lobe epilepsy (tle) specimens. in control tissue, the granule cell somata were closely approximated and formed a narrow lamina with a distinct, regular border with the molecular layer. in 11 of 15 tle specimens, the granule cell somata were dispersed and formed a wider than normal granule cell layer. the granule cell somata extended into the molecular layer to varying extents, creating an irregular boundary between the lamina. the dispersed granule cells were frequently aligned in columns, and many of these neurons displayed elongated bipolar forms. the extent of granule cell dispersion appeared to be related to the amount of cell loss in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus. granule cell dispersion was not consistently associated with granule cell loss although 5 of the 11 specimens with granule cell dispersion also showed moderate to marked granule cell loss. the most common features in the histories of the tle cases with granule cell dispersion were severe febrile seizures or seizures associated with meningitis or encephalitis during the first 4 years of life. the dispersion of the granule cells suggests that there has been some alteration in the patterns of cell migration in a subpopulation of cases with severe tle. the resultant ectopic positions of the granule cells could lead to changes in both the afferent and efferent connections of these neurons and, thus, contribute to the altered circuitry of the hippocampal formation in tle.
consensus recommendations for essential vascular care in low- and middle-income countries. the delphi technique is a widely used and accepted method for gathering data from respondents within their domain of expertise. the technique is designed as a group communication process which aims to achieve a convergence of opinion on a specific real-world issue. the delphi process has been used in various fields of study such as program planning, needs assessment, policy determination, and resource utilization to develop a full range of alternatives, explore or expose underlying assumptions, as well as correlate judgments on a topic spanning a wide range of disciplines. the delphi technique is well suited as a method for consensus-building by using a series of questionnaires delivered using multiple iterations to collect data from a panel of selected subjects. subject selection, time frames for conducting and completing a study, the possibility of low response rates, and unintentionally guiding feedback from the respondent group are areas which should be considered when designing and implementing a delphi study.
text mining and natural language processing approaches for automatic categorization of lay requests to web-based expert forums background the internet is increasingly used for health matters including ask the doctor services.   aim to describe users and usage pattern of text-based medical consultation with family physicians on the internet.   methods descriptive analysis of the first 4 years' use of a swedish ask the doctor service concerning number of inquiries, age and gender of inquirers. time of day and week, types of medical inquiries, and use in relation to population density was analyzed during the last year of the study.   results we found a considerable number of users, with 38,217 inquiries submitted to the service. three-fourths of the inquirers were women, thus exceeding the gender difference seen in regular health care. the typical user was a woman aged 21-60 years. the service was used any time day or night, 7 days a week. almost half of the inquiries were submitted during evenings and nights. most areas of medicine were represented in the inquiries, reflecting the fact that there was no control of what an inquiry should include. the use was widespread over the country but more frequent per capita in more densely populated areas as defined by postal code.   conclusion in the study of a service for text-based consultations with family physicians on the internet, we found a geographically widely distributed use, slowly but gradually increasing during a 4-year period. the use increased more rapidly among young and middle-aged women. asynchronous text-based consultation is likely to expand in the near future.
subcutaneous po2 as an index of the physiological limits for hemodilution in the rat. objective to evaluate the effects of preoperative intentional hemodilution with 4% albumin solution on the extravasation rate of intravascular albumin and fluid in surgical patients.   design a prospective, randomized, clinical study.   setting university teaching hospital.   patients two groups (control group [group 1] and hemodiluted group [group 2]) of 13 healthy patients were studied during a long-term (>4 hrs) surgical procedure.   interventions autologous technetium-99m (99mtc)-labeled red blood cells and indium-oxine ((111)in)-labeled human serum albumin were injected intravenously during anesthesia at t = 0 min in the two groups for the determination of total blood volume and albumin diffusion space, respectively. in addition, body tetrapolar electrical impedance was used to assess extracellular fluid volume. in the hemodiluted group (group 2), 15 ml/kg of blood was withdrawn over 30 mins (t = 20 mins to t = 50 mins) and simultaneously replaced by an equal volume of 4% albumin solution (0.6 g/kg).   measurements and main results the albumin diffusion space, the colloid oncotic pressure, the plasma albumin concentration and the electrical impedance were measured before (t = 10 mins) and after (t = 60, 120, and 240 mins) hemodilution. urine was collected from t = 10 mins to t = 240 mins. the total blood volume was calculated at t = 10 mins. no differences in the initial values were found between the two groups. in group 2, hemodilution (hematocrit 30 +/- 3%) resulted in a steeper increase in the albumin diffusion space (p < .05) and a progressive decrease in the body electrical impedance (p < .05). the extravasation rate of albumin was 0.052 +/- 0.007 ml/kg/min in group 2 vs. 0.038 +/- 0.020 ml/kg/min in group 1 (p < .05). the value of calculated plasma volume at t = 0 min did not shown any difference between the two groups. this value was then lower than expected in group 2, corresponding to a loss of plasma volume of >3 ml/kg. urine output was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (0.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.4 +/- 1.0 ml/min, respectively; p < .05). a comparable decrease in colloid oncotic pressure and in plasma albumin concentration was observed in both groups.   conclusions these results suggest that preoperative hemodilution using 4% albumin on a 1:1 volume basis for blood substitution during a prolonged surgical procedure with reduced blood losses enhances the extravasation rate of albumin and fluid to the interstitial tissues, impeding the maintenance of isovolemia. these findings support the use of a volume of infused colloid solution higher than that of withdrawn blood during preoperative hemodilution.
igfbp3 impedes aggressive growth of pediatric liver cancer and is epigenetically silenced in vascular invasive and metastatic tumors hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric liver tumor. the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma are unknown. cell lines can be valuable tools in the study of tumor biology, but only few hepatoblastoma cell lines have been established. we explanted tumor tissue from human hepatoblastomas to generate cell lines. a continuous cell line (hept1) was established from a human hepatoblastoma with predominant embryonal differentiation. the hept1 cell line was characterized by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, cytogenetics, and molecular genetic analysis. in addition, the cultured cells were xenografted into nude mice and the resulting tumors compared with the original tumor. the cells grew in epithelial clusters, and expressed cytokeratins and alpha-fetoprotein. injection of hept1 cells into nude mice gave rise to serially transplantable subcutaneous tumors. the cell line as well as the xenotransplants displayed the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the primary tumor. ultrastructural analysis demonstrated desmosomal junctions and the formation of bile canaliculi. cytogenetic analysis showed a near tetraploid karyotype with structural and numerical aberrations of chromosomes 1p, 6, 9, 11q, 13q, 15p, and 20 and both single and double minute chromosomes. in pcr-based microsatellite analysis of chromosome arm 11p, a loss of heterozygosity at all informative loci including the wt-1 and igf2 genes was detected. intratumoral erythropoiesis, a characteristic feature of hepatoblastomas, was present in the primary tumor as well as in hept1 xenotransplants. we therefore studied the expression of erythropoietic cytokines in these cells and found both erythropoietin and stem cell factor. the hept1 cell line displays characteristic cellular and molecular features of hepatoblastoma and we believe it will be a valuable tool for studies on the biology and pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma as well as on the differentiation of hepatocyte progenitor cells.
evaluating cellular polyfunctionality with a novel polyfunctionality index polychromatic flow cytometry results in complex, multivariate datasets. to date, tools for the aggregate analysis of these datasets across multiple specimens grouped by different categorical variables, such as demographic information, have not been optimized. often, the exploration of such datasets is accomplished by visualization of patterns with pie charts or bar charts, without easy access to statistical comparisons of measurements that comprise multiple components. here we report on algorithms and a graphical interface we developed for these purposes. in particular, we discuss thresholding necessary for accurate representation of data in pie charts, the implications for display and comparison of normalized versus unnormalized data, and the effects of averaging when samples with significant background noise are present. finally, we define a statistic for the nonparametric comparison of complex distributions to test for difference between groups of samples based on multi‐component measurements. while originally developed to support the analysis of t cell functional profiles, these techniques are amenable to a broad range of datatypes. published 2011 wiley‐liss, inc.
phospholemman overexpression inhibits na+-k+-atpase in adult rat cardiac myocytes: relevance to decreased na+ pump activity in postinfarction myocytes. overexpression of phospholemman (plm) in normal adult rat cardiac myocytes altered contractile function and cytosolic ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) homeostasis and inhibited na+/ca2+ exchanger (ncx1). in addition, plm coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with ncx1 in cardiac myocyte lysates. in this study, we evaluated whether the cytoplasmic domain of plm is crucial in mediating its effects on contractility, [ca2+]i transients, and ncx1 activity. canine plm or its derived mutants were overexpressed in adult rat myocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. confocal immunofluorescence images using canine-specific plm antibodies demonstrated that the exogenous plm or its mutants were correctly targeted to sarcolemma, t-tubules, and intercalated discs, with little to none detected in intracellular compartments. overexpression of canine plm or its mutants did not affect expression of ncx1, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase, na(+)-k(+)-atpase, and calsequestrin in adult rat myocytes. a cooh-terminal deletion mutant in which all four potential phosphorylation sites (ser62, ser63, ser68, and thr69) were deleted, a partial cooh-terminal deletion mutant in which ser68 and thr69 were deleted, and a mutant in which all four potential phosphorylation sites were changed to alanine all lost wild-type plm's ability to modulate cardiac myocyte contractility. these observations suggest the importance of ser68 or thr69 in mediating plm's effect on cardiac contractility. focusing on ser68, the ser68 to glu mutant was fully effective, the ser63 to ala (leaving ser68 intact) mutant was partially effective, and the ser68 to ala mutant was completely ineffective in modulating cardiac contractility, [ca2+]i transients, and ncx1 currents. both the ser63 to ala and ser68 to ala mutants, as well as plm, were able to coimmunoprecipitate ncx1. it is known that ser68 in plm is phosphorylated by both protein kinases a and c. we conclude that regulation of cardiac contractility, [ca2+]i transients, and ncx1 activity by plm is critically dependent on ser68. we suggest that plm phosphorylation at ser68 may be involved in camp- and/or protein kinase c-dependent regulation of cardiac contractility.
detecting the presence and absence of causal relationships between expression of yeast genes with very few samples genetic analysis of gene expression in a segregating population, which is expression profiled and genotyped at dna markers throughout the genome, can reveal regulatory networks of polymorphic genes. we propose an analysis strategy with several steps: (1) genome-wide qtl analysis of all expression profiles to identify eqtl confidence regions, followed by fine mapping of identified eqtl; (2) identification of regulatory candidate genes in each eqtl region; (3) correlation analysis of the expression profiles of the candidates in any eqtl region with the gene affected by the eqtl to reduce the number of candidates; (4) drawing directional links from retained regulatory candidate genes to genes affected by the eqtl and joining links to form networks; and (5) statistical validation and refinement of the inferred network structure. here, we apply an initial implementation of this strategy to a segregating yeast population. in 65, 7, and 28% of the identified eqtl regions, a single candidate regulatory gene, no gene, or more than one gene was retained in step 3, respectively. overall, 768 putative regulatory links were retained, 331 of which are the strongest candidate links, as they were retained in the expression correlation analysis and were located within or near an eqtl subregion identified by a multimarker analysis separating multiple linked qtl. one or several biological processes were statistically significantly overrepresented in independent network structures or in highly interconnected subnetworks. most of the transcription factors found in the inferred network had a putative regulatory link to only one other gene or exhibited cis-regulation.
identification and characterization of alternaria alternata (fr.) keissler causing ceratonia blight disease of carob (ceratonia siliqua l.) in turkey the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) addresses the evident requirement for quantitative data analysis in molecular medicine, biotechnology, microbiology and diagnostics and has become the method of choice for the quantification of mrna. although it is often described as a “gold” standard, it is far from being a standard assay. the significant problems caused by variability of rna templates, assay designs and protocols, as well as inappropriate data normalization and inconsistent data analysis, are widely known but also widely disregarded. as a first step towards standardization, we describe a series of rt-qpcr protocols that illustrate the essential technical steps required to generate quantitative data that are reliable and reproducible. we would like to emphasize, however, that rt-qpcr data constitute only a snapshot of information regarding the quantity of a given transcript in a cell or tissue. any assessment of the biological consequences of variable mrna levels must include additional information regarding regulatory rnas, protein levels and protein activity. the entire protocol described here, encompassing all stages from initial assay design to reliable qpcr data analysis, requires approximately 15 h.
genomic innovations linked to infection strategies across emerging pathogenic chytrid fungi significance chytridiomycosis has resulted in the serious decline and extinction of >200 species of amphibians worldwide and poses the greatest threat to biodiversity of any known disease. this fungal disease is currently known to be caused by batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, hitherto the only species within the entire phylum of the chytridiomycota known to parasitize vertebrate hosts. we describe the discovery of a second highly divergent, chytrid pathogen, batrachochytrium salamandrivorans sp. nov., that causes lethal skin infections in salamanders, which has resulted in steep declines in salamander populations in northwestern europe. our finding provides another explanation for the phenomenon of amphibian biodiversity loss that is emblematic of the current global biodiversity crisis. the current biodiversity crisis encompasses a sixth mass extinction event affecting the entire class of amphibians. the infectious disease chytridiomycosis is considered one of the major drivers of global amphibian population decline and extinction and is thought to be caused by a single species of aquatic fungus, batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. however, several amphibian population declines remain unexplained, among them a steep decrease in fire salamander populations (salamandra salamandra) that has brought this species to the edge of local extinction. here we isolated and characterized a unique chytrid fungus, batrachochytrium salamandrivorans sp. nov., from this salamander population. this chytrid causes erosive skin disease and rapid mortality in experimentally infected fire salamanders and was present in skin lesions of salamanders found dead during the decline event. together with the closely related b. dendrobatidis, this taxon forms a well-supported chytridiomycete clade, adapted to vertebrate hosts and highly pathogenic to amphibians. however, the lower thermal growth preference of b. salamandrivorans, compared with b. dendrobatidis, and resistance of midwife toads (alytes obstetricans) to experimental infection with b. salamandrivorans suggest differential niche occupation of the two chytrid fungi.
from lab to field: the influence of urban landscapes on the invasive potential of wolbachia in brazilian aedes aegypti mosquitoes different urban structures might affect the life history parameters of aedes aegypti and, consequently, dengue transmission. container productivity, probability of daily survival (pds) and dispersal rates were estimated for mosquito populations in a high income neighbourhood of rio de janeiro. results were contrasted with those previously found in a suburban district, as well as those recorded in a slum. after inspecting 1,041 premises, domestic drains and discarded plastic pots were identified as the most productive containers, collectively holding up to 80% of the total pupae. in addition, three cohorts of dust-marked ae. aegypti females were released and recaptured daily using bgs-traps, sticky ovitraps and backpack aspirators in 50 randomly selected houses; recapture rate ranged from 5-12.2% within cohorts. pds was determined by two models and ranged from 0.607-0.704 (exponential model) and 0.659-0.721 (non-linear model), respectively. mean distance travelled varied from 57-122 m, with a maximum dispersal of 263 m. overall, lower infestation indexes and adult female survival were observed in the high income neighbourhood, suggesting a lower dengue transmission risk in comparison to the suburban area and the slum. since results show that urban structure can influence mosquito biology, specific control strategies might be used in order to achieve cost-effective ae. aegypti control.
computer vision – eccv 2012 variation in illumination conditions caused by weather, time of day, etc., makes the task difficult when building video surveillance systems of real world scenes. especially, cast shadows produce troublesome effects, typically for object tracking from a fixed viewpoint, since it yields appearance variations of objects depending on whether they are inside or outside the shadow. in this paper, we handle such appearance variations by removing shadows in the image sequence. this can be considered as a preprocessing stage which leads to robust video surveillance. to achieve this, we propose a framework based on the idea of intrinsic images. unlike previous methods of deriving intrinsic images, we derive time-varying reflectance images and corresponding illumination images from a sequence of images instead of assuming a single reflectance image. using obtained illumination images, we normalize the input image sequence in terms of incident lighting distribution to eliminate shadowing effects. we also propose an illumination normalization scheme which can potentially run in real time, utilizing the illumination eigenspace, which captures the illumination variation due to weather, time of day, etc., and a shadow interpolation method based on shadow hulls. this paper describes the theory of the framework with simulation results and shows its effectiveness with object tracking results on real scene data sets.
acute passive stretching alters the mechanical properties of human plantar flexors and the optimal angle for maximal voluntary contraction experiments were carried out to test the effect of prolonged and repeated passive stretching (rps) of the triceps surae muscle on reflex sensitivity. the results demonstrated a clear deterioration of muscle function immediately after rps. maximal voluntary contraction, average electromyographic activity of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and zero crossing rate of the soleus muscle (recorded from 50% maximal voluntary contraction) decreased on average by 23.2, 19.9, 16.5, and 12.2%, respectively. these changes were associated with a clear immediate reduction in the reflex sensitivity; stretch reflex peak-to-peak amplitude decreased by 84. 8%, and the ratio of the electrically induced maximal hoffmann reflex to the maximal mass compound action potential decreased by 43. 8%. interestingly, a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the stretch-resisting force of the measured muscles was observed. serum creatine kinase activity stayed unaltered. this study presents evidence that the mechanism that decreases the sensitivity of short-latency reflexes can be activated because of rps. the origin of this system seems to be a reduction in the activity of the large-diameter afferents, resulting from the reduced sensitivity of the muscle spindles to repeated stretch.
hepatocellular carcinoma displays distinct dna methylation signatures with potential as clinical predictors dna microarrays have made it possible to estimate the level of expression of thousands of genes for a sample of cells. although biomedical investigators have been quick to adopt this powerful new research tool, accurate analysis and interpretation of the data have provided unique challenges. indeed, many investigators are not experienced in the analytical steps needed to convert tens of thousands of noisy data points into reliable and interpretable biologic information. although some investigators recognize the importance of collaborating with experienced biostatisticians to analyze microarray data, the number and availability of experienced biostatisticians is inadequate. consequently, investigators are using available software to analyze their data, many seemingly without knowledge of potential pitfalls. because of serious problems associated with the analysis and reporting of some dna microarray studies, there is great interest in guidance on valid and effective methods for analysis of dna microarray data. the design and analysis strategy for a dna microarray experiment should be determined in light of the overall objectives of the study. because dna microarrays are used for a wide variety of objectives, it is not feasible to address the entire range of design and analysis issues in this commentary. here, we address statistical issues that arise from the use of dna microarrays for an important group of objectives that has been called “class prediction” (1). class prediction includes derivation of predictors of prognosis, response to therapy, or any phenotype or genotype defined independently of the gene expression profile.
learning deep hidden nonlinear dynamics from aggregate data abstract in this paper we consider an ornstein–uhlenbeck (ou) process (m(t))t≥0 whose parameters are determined by an external markov process (x(t))t≥0 on a finite state space {1, . . ., d}; this process is usually referred to as markov-modulated ornstein–uhlenbeck. we use stochastic integration theory to determine explicit expressions for the mean and variance of m(t). then we establish a system of partial differential equations (pdes) for the laplace transform of m(t) and the state x(t) of the background process, jointly for time epochs t = t1, . . ., tk. then we use this pde to set up a recursion that yields all moments of m(t) and its stationary counterpart; we also find an expression for the covariance between m(t) and m(t + u). we then establish a functional central limit theorem for m(t) for the situation that certain parameters of the underlying ou processes are scaled, in combination with the modulating markov process being accelerated; interestingly, specific scalings lead to drastically different limiting processes. we conclude the paper by considering the situation of a single markov process modulating multiple ou processes.
"you are getting too old, find a man and marry": social aspects of motivation to choose teacher education abstract the present study explored reasons behind graduates’ decisions to pursue teaching as a career, in a 1-year pre-service teacher education program at an australian university, located in melbourne ( n = 74 ) . a survey collected data about respondents’ reasons for choosing teaching as a career, with open-ended questions eliciting rich qualitative data to elaborate on rating-scale responses. five factors relating to social status, career fit, prior considerations, financial reward and time for family were identified through factor analyses. respondents’ ratings were independent of previous level of qualification and having children or not, with little evidence for gender differences. three distinct clusters of students showed that different combinations of reasons were relevant to each group's choice of teaching as a career, and these reasons were further illustrated and discussed in relation to qualitative data from open-ended survey questions.
multivariate time–frequency analysis of electromagnetic brain activity during bimanual motor learning this paper introduces a new tool for functional neuroimage analysis: partial least squares (pls). it is unique as a multivariate method in its choice of emphasis for analysis, that being the covariance between brain images and exogenous blocks representing either the experiment design or some behavioral measure. what emerges are spatial patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association between the images and either of the blocks. this process differs substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels, pls attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task or behavior. data from a face encoding and recognition pet rcbf study are used to illustrate two types of pls analysis: an activation analysis of task with images and a brain-behavior analysis. the commonalities across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. pls thus serves as an important extension by extracting new information from imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.
cmdabcdef, a cluster of genes encoding membrane proteins for differentiation and antibiotic production in streptomyces coelicolor a3(2) streptomycetes are high g+c gram-positive, antibiotic-producing, mycelial soil bacteria. the 8.7-mb streptomyces coelicolor genome was previously sequenced by using an ordered library of supercos-1 clones. here, we describe an efficient procedure for creating precise gene replacements in the cosmid clones by using pcr targeting and λ-red-mediated recombination. the cloned streptomyces genes are replaced with a cassette containing a selectable antibiotic resistance and oritrk2 for efficient transfer to streptomyces by rp4-mediated intergeneric conjugation. supercos-1 does not replicate in streptomyces, but the clones readily undergo double-crossover recombination, thus creating gene replacements. the antibiotic resistance cassettes are flanked by yeast flp recombinase target sequences for removal of the antibiotic resistance and oritrk2 to generate unmarked, nonpolar mutations. the technique has been used successfully by >20 researchers to mutate around 100 streptomyces genes. as an example, we describe its application to the discovery of a gene involved in the production of geosmin, the ubiquitous odor of soil. the gene, sco6073 (cyc2), codes for a protein with two sesquiterpene synthase domains, only one of which is required for geosmin biosynthesis, probably via a germacra-1 (10) e,5e-dien-11-ol intermediate generated by the sesquiterpene synthase from farnesyl pyrophosphate.
ex vivo expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells by garcinol, a potent inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase summary a cell line derived from a myeloma patient was found to produce only λ−type light chains of immunoglobulin which were secreted into the culture medium. there appears to be no formation of γ−, α−, or μ−heavy chains or of intact immunoglobulins. the light chains produced gave a reaction of identity with the bence-jones protein of the original patient's urine upon immunodiffusion and showed a similar molecular size upon gel filtration. the cells produced about 15 μg λ−chain per day per 106 cells (45 × 107 chain molecules per day per cell) under the culture conditions used.
interpreting time in text summarizing text with time event coreference is an important and complicated task in cascaded event template extraction and other natural language processing tasks. despite its importance, it was merely discussed in previous studies. in this paper, we present a globally optimized coreference resolution system dedicated to various sophisticated event coreference phenomena. seven resolvers for both event and object coreference cases are utilized, which include three new resolvers for event coreference resolution. three enhancements are further proposed at both mention pair detection and chain formation levels. first, the object coreference resolvers are used to effectively reduce the false positive cases for event coreference. second, a revised instance selection scheme is proposed to improve link level mention-pair model performances. last but not least, an efficient and globally optimized graph partitioning model is employed for coreference chain formation using spectral partitioning which allows the incorporation of pronoun coreference information. the three techniques contribute to a significant improvement of 8.54% in b 3 f-score for event coreference resolution on ontonotes 2.0 corpus.
asfalt: a simple fault-tolerant signature-based localization technique for emergency sensor networks wireless sensor networks have gained considerable attention in the past few years. they have found application domains in battlefield communication, homeland security, pollution sensing, and traffic monitoring. as such, there has been an increasing need to define and develop simulation frameworks for carrying out high-fidelity wsn simulation. in this article we present a modeling, simulation, and emulation framework for wsns in j-sim - an open source, component-based compositional network simulation environment developed entirely in java. this framework is built on the autonomous component architecture and extensible internetworking framework of j-sim, and provides an object-oriented definition of target, sensor, and sink nodes, sensor and wireless communication channels, and physical media such as seismic channels, mobility models, and power models (both energy-producing and energy-consuming components). application-specific models can be defined by subclassing classes in the simulation framework and customizing their behaviors. we also include in j-sim a set of classes and mechanisms to realize network emulation. we demonstrate the use of the proposed wsn simulation framework by implementing several well-known localization, geographic routing, and directed diffusion protocols, and perform performance comparisons (in terms of the execution time incurred and memory used) in simulating wsn scenarios in j-sim and ns-2. the simulation study indicates the wsn framework in j-sim is much more scalable than ns-2 (especially in memory usage). we also demonstrate the use of the wsn framework in carrying out real-life full-fledged future combat system (fcs) simulation and emulation
what is known about adverse events in older medical hospital inpatients? a systematic review of the literature. objectives to estimate the extent, preventability and consequences of adverse clinical events in elderly and non-elderly patients.   design a two-stage structured, retrospective, patient case-note review.   setting a large nhs hospital in england.   population a random sample of 1,006 non-psychiatric patients.   main outcome measures proportion of patients with adverse events, the proportion of preventable adverse events and the types and consequences of adverse events in patients >or=75 and under 75 years old.   results forty five [13.5%; 95% confidence interval (ci) 10-17] of 332 patients >or=75 years and 42 (6.2%; 95% ci 4-8) of 674 patients <75 years had at least one adverse event. there was a significantly raised risk of experiencing an adverse event with increasing age [odds ratio (or) = 1.03 adverse events per year of life, p < 0.001]. there was no statistically significant difference in preventability of adverse events and also in experiencing disability or death as a result of an adverse event by age after adjustment for potential confounders.   conclusion adverse events are significantly more common in non-psychiatric elderly inpatients than younger patients. there is little evidence that adverse events in older patients are more preventable and lead to disability or death more frequently.
integrating biological knowledge into variable selection: an empirical bayes approach with an application in cancer biology the need to explore model uncertainty in linear regression models with many predictors has motivated improvements in markov chain monte carlo sampling algorithms for bayesian variable selection. currently used sampling algorithms for bayesian variable selection may perform poorly when there are severe multicollinearities among the predictors. this article describes a new sampling method based on an analogy with the swendsen-wang algorithm for the ising model, and which can give substantial improvements over alternative sampling schemes in the presence of multicollinearity. in linear regression with a given set of potential predictors we can index possible models by a binary parameter vector that indicates which of the predictors are included or excluded. by thinking of the posterior distribution of this parameter as a binary spatial field, we can use auxiliary variable methods inspired by the swendsen-wang algorithm for the ising model to sample from the posterior where dependence among parameters is reduced by conditioning on auxiliary variables. performance of the method is described for both simulated and real data.
the two agpase subunits evolve at different rates in angiosperms, yet they are equally sensitive to activity-altering amino acid changes when expressed in bacteria[w] adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (agpase) catalyzes a rate-limiting step in starch biosynthesis. the reaction produces adp-glucose and pyrophosphate from glucose-1-p and atp. investigations from a number of laboratories have shown that alterations in allosteric properties as well as heat stability of this enzyme have dramatic positive effects on starch synthesis in the potato (solanum tuberosum) tuber and seeds of important cereals. here, we report the characterization of purified recombinant mosaic agpases derived from protein motifs normally expressed in the maize (zea mays) endosperm and the potato tuber. these exhibit properties that should be advantageous when expressed in plants. we also present an in-depth characterization of the kinetic and allosteric properties of these purified recombinant agpases. these data point to previously unrecognized roles for known allosteric effectors.
cutaneous appendageal carcinoma incidence and survival patterns in the united states: a population-based study. a variety of graphical approaches have been used to visually portray and analyze temporal trends, especially annual rates of change, in disease rates. in reviewing their own work, the authors have found that they could improve on their graphical presentations by choosing an arithmetic or logarithmic scale according to the research question being addressed, by selecting scaling ratios of the axes that allow one to detect specific rates of change, and by using uniform scaling ratios to facilitate comparisons across graphs. different presentations of the same data can result in different impressions. the authors used rates over a 40-year period to illustrate the concepts involved and to investigate the portrayal of various rates of change. these principles extend to the plotting of odds ratios or relative risks, where the choice of an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic axis also can result in a misleading plot. the authors conclude that a graph should be designed and studied with care, clearly reflect the truth, convey information, and make a point without overemphasizing. for the particular problem addressed here, displaying temporal trends in disease rates, they see advantages in justifiable uniformity. attention to plotting techniques in the epidemiologic and medical literature should be encouraged.
analysis of cerebrovascular diseases by a new 3-dimensional computerised x-ray angiography system abstract we give a new method for direct reconstruction of three-dimensional objects from a few electron micrographs taken at angles which need not exceed a range of 60 degrees. the method works for totally asymmetric objects, and requires little computer time or storage. it is also applicable to x-ray photography, and may greatly reduce the exposure compared to current methods of body-section radiography.
patterns of diversity, areas of endemism, and multiple glacial refuges for freshwater crabs of the genus sinopotamon in china (decapoda: brachyura: potamidae) aim  to investigate biogeographical patterns of the obligate freshwater fish order characiformes.    location  south america.    methods  parsimony analysis of endemicity, likelihood analysis of congruent geographical distribution, and partition bremer support were used.    results  areas of endemism are deduced from parsimony analysis of endemicity, and putative dispersal routes from a separate analysis of discordant patterns of distribution.    main conclusions  our results demonstrate the occurrence of 11 major areas of endemism and support a preferential eastern–western differentiation of the characiforms in the amazonian region, contrasting with the southern–northern differentiation of terrestrial organisms. the areas of endemism identified seem to be deeply influenced by the distribution of the emerged land during the 100-m marine highstand that occurred during the late miocene and allow us to hypothesize the existence of eight aquatic freshwater refuges at that time. the raw distribution of non-endemic species supports nine patterns of species distribution across the 11 areas of endemism, two of which support a southern–northern differentiation in the eastern part of the amazon. this result shows that the main channel of the amazon limited dispersal between tributaries from each bank of the river. the levels of endemism further demonstrate that the aquatic freshwater refuges promoted allopatric speciation and later allowed the colonization of the lowlands. by contrast, the biogeographical pattern found in the western part of the amazon is identified as a result of the miocene andean foreland dynamic and the uplift of the palaeoarches that promoted allopatric divergence across several sedimentary basins by the establishment of disconnected floodplains. the assessment of conflicting species distributions also shows the presence of seven putative dispersal routes between the amazon, orinoco and parana rivers. our findings suggest that, rather than there being a single predominant process, the establishment of the modern south american freshwater fish biotas is the result of an interaction between marine incursions, uplift of the palaeoarches, and historical connections allowing cross-drainage dispersal.
nts adenosine a2a receptors inhibit the cardiopulmonary chemoreflex control of regional sympathetic outputs via a gabaergic mechanism. ichinose tk, o’leary ds, scislo tj. activation of nts a2a adenosine receptors differentially resets baroreflex control of renal vs. adrenal sympathetic nerve activity. am j physiol heart circ physiol 296: h1058 –h1068, 2009. first published february 6, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00906.2008.—the role of nucleus of solitary tract (nts) a2a adenosine receptors in baroreflex mechanisms is controversial. stimulation of these receptors releases glutamate within the nts and elicits baroreflex-like decreases in mean arterial pressure (map), heart rate (hr), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (rsna), whereas inhibition of these receptors attenuates hr baroreflex responses. in contrast, stimulation of nts a2a adenosine receptors increases preganglionic adrenal sympathetic nerve activity (preasna), and the depressor and sympathoinhibitory responses are not markedly affected by sinoaortic denervation and blockade of nts glutamatergic transmission. to elucidate the role of nts a2a adenosine receptors in baroreflex function, we compared full baroreflex stimulus-response curves for hr, rsna, and pre-asna (intravenous nitroprusside/phenylephrine) before and after bilateral nts microinjections of selective adenosine a2a receptor agonist (cgs-21680; 2.0, 20 pmol/50 nl), selective a2a receptor antagonist (zm-241385; 40 pmol/100 nl), and nonselective a1 a2a receptor antagonist (8-spt; 1 nmol/100 nl) in urethane/ -chloralose anesthetized rats. activation of a2a receptors decreased the range, upper plateau, and gain of baroreflex-response curves for rsna, whereas these parameters all increased for pre-asna, consistent with direct effects of the agonist on regional sympathetic activity. however, no resetting of baroreflexresponse curves along the map axis occurred despite the marked decreases in baseline map. the antagonists had no marked effects on baseline variables or baroreflex-response functions. we conclude that the activation of nts a2a adenosine receptors differentially alters baroreflex control of hr, rsna, and pre-asna mostly via nonbaroreflex mechanism(s), and these receptors have virtually no tonic action on baroreflex control of these sympathetic outputs.
probabilistic preference learning with the mallows rank model the mallows and generalized mallows models are two of the most popular probability models for distributions on permutations. in this paper we consider both models under the hamming distance. this models can be seen as models for matchings instead of models for rankings. these models can not be factorized, which contrasts with the popular mm and gmm under kendall’s-τ and cayley distances. in order to overcome the computational issues that the models involve, we introduce a novel method for computing the partition function. by adapting this method we can compute the expectation, joint and conditional probabilities. all these methods are the basis for three sampling algorithms, which we propose and analyze. moreover, we also propose a learning algorithm. all the algorithms are analyzed both theoretically and empirically, using synthetic and real data from the context of e-learning and massive open online courses (mooc).
osmoregulatory control of renal sodium excretion after sodium loading in humans. the renal response to a selective increase in the na+ concentration of the blood perfusing the central nervous system was investigated in conscious dogs treated with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat and the aldosterone antagonist canrenoate. in split-infusion experiments the plasma [na+] of carotid blood was increased (approx. 6 mm) by bilateral infusion of hypertonic nac1. concomitantly distilled water was infused into the v. cava making the sum of the infusions isotonic. in control experiments isotonic saline was infused at identical rates into all three catheters. na+ excretion increased markedly in both series, 103 +/- 14 to 678 +/- 84 mumol min-1 during split-infusion and 90 +2- 14 to 496 +/- 74 mumol min-1 during the isotonic volume expansion. peak rate of excretion, peak fractional sodium excretion, and cumulative sodium excretion were all significantly higher (p < 0.05) during split-infusion than during control experiments. plasma vasopressin increased only during split-infusion (0.68 +/- 0.11 to 2.4 +/- 0.8 pg ml-1) while the increases in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide were similar in the two series. urinary excretion of urodilatin (anp95-126) increased significantly more during split-infusion (46 +/- 11 to 152 +/- 28 fmol min-1) than during the isotonic volume expansion (45 +/- 14 to 84 +/- 16 fmol min-1) (p < 0.05). it is concluded that the natriuretic mechanisms activated by a selective increase in the na+ concentration of carotid blood and associated with increased excretion of urodilatin cannot be eliminated by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
effects of glucocorticoids on age-related impairments of hippocampal structure and function in mice we introduce a way to count and measure cells in an optically defined volume of tissue called a counting box. this method—direct three‐dimensional counting (3dc)—eliminates the need for correction factors, such as that introduced by abercrombie (anat. rec. 94:239–247, '46), to determine the number of cells per unit volume (nv). problems caused by irregular cell shape and cell size, nonrandom orientation, and splitting of cells by the knife during sectioning are overcome. furthermore, 3dc is insensitive to large variations in section thickness.
sep-nets: small and effective pattern networks the explosion of image data on the internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. but exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. we introduce here a new database called “imagenet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the wordnet structure. imagenet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of wordnet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. this will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of wordnet. this paper offers a detailed analysis of imagenet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. we show that imagenet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. we describe the data collection scheme with amazon mechanical turk. lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of imagenet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. we hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of imagenet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.

is the reduction of lower-body subcutaneous adipose tissue associated with elevations in risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease? objective the primary objective was to examine whether the combination of diet and aerobic exercise (da) or diet and resistance exercise (dr) is associated with greater improvements in metabolic risk factors by comparison to diet only (do) in obese women. a second objective considered whether reductions in metabolic risk factors are related to concurrent changes in abdominal and/or intermuscular fat distribution.   research design and methods a total of 38 premenopausal obese women were randomly assigned to one of three 16-week treatments: do (n=13), da (n=11), or dr (n=14). plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid levels were measured in a fasting state and after a 75-g oral glucose challenge (oral glucose tolerance test [ogtt]). total, abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, and intermuscular fat were measured by magnetic resonance imaging.   results significant reductions (p < 0.02) in body weight (approximately 10 kg or 10%) and in total, abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, and intermuscular fat were observed within each group. fasting and ogtt insulin, total cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, and apolipoprotein b also decreased within each group (p < or = 0.02). the changes in the body fat and metabolic variables were not different across treatment (p > 0.05). visceral fat alone was related to the metabolic risk factors both before and after the treatment.   conclusions weight loss was associated with reductions in metabolic risk factors in obese women. the improvement in the metabolic profile was not enhanced by the addition of aerobic or resistance exercise. the findings reinforce the importance of diminished visceral fat in the treatment of insulin resistance.
effect of bradykinin, tgf-β1, il-1β, and hypoxia on cox-2 expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells the inducible cyclooxygenase, cox-2, has been associated with vascular inflammation and cellular proliferation. we have discovered that hypoxia increases expression of the cox-2 gene in human vascular endothelial cells in culture independent of other stimuli. western analysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) revealed a greater than 4-fold induction of protein by hypoxia (1% o2). the steady-state level of cox-2 mrna was correspondingly elevated by both northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with antibody supershifting, we also found that hypoxia causes increased binding of nf-κb p65 (rel a) to the one out of the two nf-κb consensus elements in the cox-2 promoter which is closest to the transcription start site of the cox-2 gene. transfection of an immortalized human microvascular endothelial cell line (hmec-1) with mutation reporter gene constructs and huvec with both mutation and deletion reporter gene constructs suggested that transcription of the cox-2 gene was enhanced by hypoxia. in transcription factor decoy experiments, hypoxic huvec were exposed in culture to 20 μm of the same nf-κb element found to bind nf-κb protein. the wild type transcription factor decoy prevented hypoxic induction of cox-2, presumably by binding with cytoplasmic p65; however, mutated or scrambled oligonucleotides did not prevent the increase in cox-2 protein expression by hypoxia. thus, the intracellular signaling mechanism that leads to induction of cox-2 by hypoxia includes binding of p65 to the relatively 3′ nf-κb consensus element in the cox-2 upstream promoter region in human vascular endothelial cells.
cosmopolitan distribution of a trypanosomatid leptomonas pyrrhocoris. unlabelled raxml-vi-hpc (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood for high performance computing) is a sequential and parallel program for inference of large phylogenies with maximum likelihood (ml). low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the gtr+cat approximation as replacement for gtr+gamma yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of raxml. a large-scale performance comparison with garli, phyml, iqpnni and mrbayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that raxml requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (garli) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. on datasets > or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than garli. raxml has been parallelized with mpi to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. the program has been used to compute ml trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively.   availability icwww.epfl.ch/~stamatak
a literature review of the use of gis-based measures of access to health care services background although malaria is known to be a major cause of child mortality and morbidity throughout sub-saharan africa there are few detailed studies of malaria mortality rates and incidence of severe malarial disease in defined communities. we have studied the geographical pattern of admissions to hospital with severe malaria and the stability of this pattern over time in kilifi district on the kenyan coast.   methods over a 2-year period all children under 5 years of age with severe malaria admitted to the district hospital and living in a rural study population of about 50,000 people were identified. annual censuses were carried out in the study area, and all households were mapped using a hand-held satellite navigation system. the resulting databases were linked using a geographical information system (gis).   results using methods originally developed for the study of the geographical distribution of childhood leukaemia we assessed the spatial pattern of hospital admission rates for severe malaria. as expected, admission rates were significantly higher in children with easier access to the hospital. for example, those living more than 25 km from the hospital had admission rates which were about one-fifth of those for children living within 5 km of the hospital. those living more than 2.5 km from the nearest road had admission rates that were about half of those for children living within 0.5 km of a road. we also investigated short-term local fluctuations in severe malaria and found evidence of space-time clustering of severe malaria.   conclusions hospital admission rates for severe malaria are higher in households with better access to hospital than in those further away. the finding of space-time clusters of severe malaria suggests that it would be of value to conduct case-control studies of environmental, genetic and human behavioural factors involved in the aetiology of the disease.
toxinotyping of necrotic enteritis-producing and commensal isolates of clostridium perfringens from chickens fed organic diets abstract necrotic enteritis is an enteric disease of avian species caused by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium perfringens. the disease is regularly controlled in the broiler chicken industry with antimicrobials in feed but is reemerging in areas such as europe where there is a ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters. to study prospective therapies, researchers must be able to reproduce this disease in a controlled environment, but this is not always possible because of differences in the pathogenicity of c. perfringens strains. our objective was to test the potential of five isolates (snecp43, 44, 47, 49, and 50), taken from field cases of necrotic enteritis, at recreating the disease in a controlled challenge experiment. snecp43 and 50 were derived from a common clone, with snecp50 passed in vivo and snecp43 subcultured in vitro. four hundred birds were divided into 16 pens, with three pens each receiving one of five treatments, with one control pen. day-old birds were raised on a high wheat-based diet to promote necrotic enteritis development and were challenged with between 3.4 × 109 and 3.2 × 1011 colony-forming units (cfu) of c. perfringens in feed for a period of 24 hr starting on day 13 of the challenge experiment. lesion scores were assessed on two birds per pen sacrificed on day 17 and on any dead birds during the 25-day study. growth performance was assessed up to 25 days, and mortality recorded throughout. only snecp50 produced necrotic enteritis mortalities significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from the control. the five isolates were also typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to assess their genetic relatedness. all epidemiologically unrelated isolates were deemed genetically unrelated, whereas snecp43 and 50 differed by only a single minor band. toxin type was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr), which was also used for the detection of the gene encoding the β2-toxin.

weakly supervised semantic labelling and instance segmentation pixel-level labelling tasks, such as semantic segmentation, play a central role in image understanding. recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. one central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. to solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (cnns) and conditional random fields (crfs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. to this end, we formulate conditional random fields with gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as recurrent neural networks. this network, called crf-rnn, is then plugged in as a part of a cnn to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both cnns and crfs. importantly, our system fully integrates crf modelling with cnns, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. we apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging pascal voc 2012 segmentation benchmark.
effects of increased spatial complexity on behavioural development and task performance in lister hooded rats in this paper we describe a new memory test in rats, based on the differential exploration of familiar and new objects. in a first trial (t1), rats are exposed to one or to two identical objects (samples) and in a second trial, to two dissimilar objects, a familiar (the sample) and a new one. for short intertrial intervals (approximately 1 min), most rats discriminate between the two objects in t2: they spend more time in exploring the new object than the familiar one. this test has several interesting characteristics: (1) it is similar to visual recognition tests widely used in subhuman primates, this allows interspecies comparisons; (2) it is entirely based on the spontaneous behavior of rats and can be considered as a 'pure' working-memory test completely free of reference memory component; (3) it does not involve primary reinforcement such as food or electric shocks, this makes it comparable to memory tests currently used in man.
population and allelic variation of a-to-i rna editing in human transcriptomes to characterize the genetic variation of alternative splicing, we develop glimmps, a robust statistical method for detecting splicing quantitative trait loci (sqtls) from rna-seq data. glimmps takes into account the individual variation in sequencing coverage and the noise prevalent in rna-seq data. analyses of simulated and real rna-seq datasets demonstrate that glimmps outperforms competing statistical models. quantitative rt-pcr tests of 26 randomly selected glimmps sqtls yielded a validation rate of 100%. as population-scale rna-seq studies become increasingly affordable and popular, glimmps provides a useful tool for elucidating the genetic variation of alternative splicing in humans and model organisms.
personality factors and suicide risk in a representative sample of the german general population objective to assess the validity and utility of prime-md (primary care evaluation of mental disorders), a new rapid procedure for diagnosing mental disorders by primary care physicians.   design survey; criterion standard.   setting four primary care clinics.   subjects a total of 1000 adult patients (369 selected by convenience and 631 selected by site-specific methods to avoid sampling bias) assessed by 31 primary care physicians.   main outcome measures prime-md diagnoses, independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals, functional status measures (short-form general health survey), disability days, health care utilization, and treatment/referral decisions.   results twenty-six percent of the patients had a prime-md diagnosis that met full criteria for a specific disorder according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, revised third edition. the average time required of the primary care physician to complete the prime-md evaluation was 8.4 minutes. there was good agreement between prime-md diagnoses and those of independent mental health professionals (for the diagnosis of any prime-md disorder, kappa = 0.71; overall accuracy rate = 88%). patients with prime-md diagnoses had lower functioning, more disability days, and higher rates of health care utilization than did patients without prime-md diagnoses (for all measures, p < .005). nearly half (48%) of 287 patients with a prime-md diagnosis who were somewhat or fairly well-known to their physicians had not been recognized to have that diagnosis before the prime-md evaluation. a new treatment or referral was initiated for 62% of the 125 patients with a prime-md diagnosis who were not already being treated.   conclusion prime-md appears to be a useful tool for identifying mental disorders in primary care practice and research.
dependent partitioning in this paper we consider productivity challenges for parallel programmers and explore ways that parallel language design might help improve end-user productivity. we offer a candidate list of desirable qualities for a parallel programming language, and describe how these qualities are addressed in the design of the chapel language. in doing so, we provide an overview of chapel's features and how they help address parallel productivity. we also survey current techniques for parallel programming and describe ways in which we consider them to fall short of our idealized productive programming model.
erratum to: a preliminary double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study of baclofen effects in alcoholic smokers it has been suggested that a crucial dimension of alcohol "craving" includes the concept of both obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive behaviors toward drinking. an interview-based rating scale, the yale-brown obsessive compulsive scale-heavy drinkers (ybocs-hd), has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcohol-dependent individuals. a self-rating scale, the obsessive compulsive drinking scale (ocds) has been developed by us as a modification of the ybocs-hd. the ybocs-hd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands. the correlation between the ybocs-hd and the ocds total scores obtained on 60 alcohol-dependent individuals was 0.83. the test-retest correlation for the ocds total score was 0.96, and the obsessive and compulsive subscales test-retest correlations were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. the internal consistency of the items in the ocds was high (0.86) and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items. the shared variance between the ocds scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20%, indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking. as such, it might act as an independent measure of the "state of illness" for alcohol-dependent individuals. when used during a prospective 12-week treatment research study, initial results indicate that the ocds seems to validly measure a dimension of alcohol dependence, because it decreased from baseline during alcohol reduction and increased in relationship to relapse drinking.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
selective transmission of r5 hiv-1 over x4 hiv-1 at the dendritic cell–t cell infectious synapse is determined by the t cell activation state dendritic cells (dcs) act as a portal for virus invasion and as the most potent antigen-presenting cells in antiviral host defense. human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1 has served as the paradigm for virus interaction with dcs. hiv-1 infection of dcs via its primary cd4 receptor and secondary chemokine receptors leads to full virus replication (cis infection), whereas binding to c-type lectin receptors results both in cis replication, as well as transfer and replication of virus in cd4(pos) t cells (trans infection). dcs respond to this invasion by processing viral proteins through mhc class i and ii pathways and undergoing a maturation that enhances their presentation of antigen to t cells for induction of adaptive antiviral immunity. hiv-1 and other viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert this immune function. engineering of dcs with various forms of viral immunogens and co-treatment with cytokines and chemokines is being used as an immunotherapy for hiv-1 and other viral infections.
regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis by cell-surface expression of kinase dead ddr2. the discoidin domain receptors, ddr1 and ddr2, are receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by native triple-helical collagen. here we have located three specific ddr2 binding sites by screening the entire triple-helical domain of collagen ii, using the collagen ii toolkit, a set of overlapping triple-helical peptides. the peptide sequence that bound ddr2 with highest affinity interestingly contained the sequence for the high affinity binding site for von willebrand factor in collagen iii. focusing on this sequence, we used a set of truncated and alanine-substituted peptides to characterize the sequence gvmgfo (o is hydroxyproline) as the minimal collagen sequence required for ddr2 binding. based on a recent nmr analysis of the ddr2 collagen binding domain, we generated a model of the ddr2-collagen interaction that explains why a triple-helical conformation is required for binding. triple-helical peptides comprising the ddr2 binding motif not only inhibited ddr2 binding to collagen ii but also activated ddr2 transmembrane signaling. thus, ddr2 activation may be effected by single triple-helices rather than fibrillar collagen.
examination of sox2 in variable ocular conditions identifies a recurrent deletion in microphthalmia and lack of mutations in other phenotypes a submicroscopic deletion containing sox2 was identified at the 3q breakpoint in a child with t(3;11)(q26.3;p11.2) associated with bilateral anophthalmia. subsequent sox2 mutation analysis identified de novo truncating mutations of sox2 in 4 of 35 (11%) individuals with anophthalmia. both eyes were affected in all cases with an identified mutation.
comparison of us and uk rankings of lis journals a study of the perceived prestige of a core group of library journals by directors of arl libraries and library school deans reveals a prestige hierarchy for each group. although in rough agreement on the rating of two-thirds of the journals, the deans and directors differ significantly on the ratings of the remaining one-third. the subset of arl directors in institutions where librarians have faculty status as evidenced by tenure does not rate journals substantially more like library school deans than do arl directors as a whole, and library school deans are shown to agree much more as a group on their ratings than the arl directors.
discriminative learning with markov logic networks we study the numerical performance of a limited memory quasi-newton method for large scale optimization, which we call the l-bfgs method. we compare its performance with that of the method developed by buckley and lenir (1985), which combines cycles of bfgs steps and conjugate direction steps. our numerical tests indicate that the l-bfgs method is faster than the method of buckley and lenir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. we show that the l-bfgs method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. we then compare the l-bfgs method with the partitioned quasi-newton method of griewank and toint (1982a). the results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-newton method is clearly superior to the l-bfgs method. however we find that for other problems the l-bfgs method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. we also study the convergence properties of the l-bfgs method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.
metabolic rate and membrane fatty acid composition in birds: a comparison between long-living parrots and short-living fowl summary futile cycling of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane contributes significantly to standard metabolic rate in a variety of ectothermic and endothermic animals, but adaptations of the mitochondrial bioenergetics to different environmental conditions have rarely been studied in ectotherms. changes in ambient temperature and nutritional status have a great effect on the physiological demands of ectothermic amphibians and may require the adjustment of mitochondrial efficiency. in order to investigate the effect of temperature and nutritional status on the mitochondrial level, we exposed male cane toads to either 10°c or 30°c and fasted half of the animals in each group. cold exposure resulted in a fourfold reduction of the resting metabolic rate whereas nutritional status had only minor effects. the mitochondrial adjustments to each condition were observed by comparing the proton leak kinetics of isolated liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria at 25°c. in response to cold exposure, liver mitochondria showed a decrease in proton conductance while skeletal muscle mitochondria were unchanged. additional food deprivation had minor effects in skeletal muscle, but in liver we uncovered surprising differences in energy saving mechanisms between the acclimation temperatures: in warm-acclimated toads, fasting resulted in a decrease of the proton conductance whereas in cold-acclimated toads, the activity of the respiratory chain was reduced. to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial proton leakage, we determined the adenine-nucleotide transporter (ant) content, which explained tissue-specific differences in the basal proton leak, but neither the ant nor uncoupling protein (ucp) gene expression correlated with alterations of the proton leak in response to physiological stimuli.
predator density and the functional responses of coral reef fish animals in social aggregations often spend more time foraging than solitary conspecifics. this may be a product of the relative safety afforded by aggregations: group members can devote more time to foraging and less time to antipredator behaviors than solitary animals (the “risk reduction” effect). all else being equal, risk reduction should result in higher food intake for grouped animals. however, intragroup competition may force group members to spend more time foraging in order to obtain the same food ration as solitary individuals (the “resource competition” effect). we compared these opposing explanations of foraging time allocation in a coral reef fish, bluehead wrasse (thalassoma bifasciatum). aggregations of juvenile bluehead wrasse experience safety-in-numbers, and preliminary observations suggested that juveniles in aggregations spent more time foraging for copepods in the water column than solitary juveniles. however, the risk reduction and resource competition hypotheses are indistinguishable on the basis of behavioral observations alone. therefore, we collected behavioral, dietary, and growth data (using otolith growth rings) for bluehead wrasse at multiple reefs around a caribbean island. despite spending more time foraging in the water column, grouped fish did not capture more prey items and had slower growth rates than solitary fish. thus, the increased foraging time of grouped fish appears to reflect resource competition, not risk reduction. this competition may limit the size and frequency of aggregations among juvenile bluehead wrasse, which have been shown to experience reduced mortality rates in larger groups. bluehead wrasse recruits also spent less time foraging but grew faster at sites where planktonic copepod prey were more abundant. this suggests the possibility that large-scale spatiotemporal variability in the abundance of planktonic copepods over coral reefs may produce corresponding variability in the dynamics of reef fish populations.
healthcare can change from within: sustained improvement in the healthcare response to intimate partner violence this study tested four hypotheses about the impact of a 3-h domestic violence training program with 752 health care providers on attitudes and values related to screening and helping partner violence victims. hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 were that training would be related to: 1) increased self-efficacy to identify and help partner violence victims, 2) increased endorsement of the role of health care providers and settings for helping partner violence victims, and 3) increased comfort making appropriate community referrals to help partner violence victims. hypothesis 4 was that training effects would be moderated by prior training and by prior experience with helping a victim. following training, health care providers reported increased self-efficacy, increased comfort making appropriate community referrals, and increased valuation of health care providers and the health care system as having an important role in stopping domestic violence. hypothesis 4 was also supported. prior training and/or experience with an abuse victim predicted smaller changes in the dependent variables. these gains held at a 6-month follow-up. implications for training curriculum design are discussed, in addition to institutional policy implications for determining the benefits versus costs of universal training, including staff who demonstrate prior training or experience with battered victims. study limitations and future research directions, including the need to measure performance and policy compliance will also be outlined.
statistical analysis of nonlinear structural equation models with continuous and polytomous data. we consider the optimal scaling problem for proposal distributions in hastings–metropolis algorithms derived from langevin diffusions. we prove an asymptotic diffusion limit theorem and show that the relative efficiency of the algorithm can be characterized by its overall acceptance rate, independently of the target distribution. the asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.574. we show that, as a function of dimension n, the complexity of the algorithm is o(n1/3), which compares favourably with the o(n) complexity of random walk metropolis algorithms. we illustrate this comparison with some example simulations.
favorable short-term outcome of transplanted hearts selected from marginal donors by pharmacological stress echocardiography. we compared orthotopic heart transplantation (ht) by bicaval technique with the standard technique. between january 1995 and december 1997, 117 patients underwent 118 hts; 71 patients (15 women and 56 men) had 72 hts by standard technique and 46 patients (9 women, 37 men) underwent ht using bicaval procedures. preoperative parameters were similar in both groups; 5 patients who underwent the standard technique and no patients who underwent bicaval procedures required permanent pacemakers (p = ns). isoproterenol infusion was significantly longer in the standard technique. major perioperative arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, asystole) appeared in 8.2% and 7.0% of standard and bicaval hts, respectively; atrial fibrillation appeared in 13.1% and 4.6%, respectively (p = ns). at 1 month, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation rates were higher in the standard group (p = ns); at 1 year only tricuspid regurgitation was still higher (p = ns). right atrial pressure, wood units, cardiac output, and cardiac index were examined (p = ns). at multivariate analysis, interaction between preoperative wood units and transplant type was elicited for wood units at 1 month and for right atrial pressure at 1, 3, and 6 months. in the high resistance subgroup, the patients who underwent bicaval procedures had higher resistances at 1 month. in the low resistance subgroup, right atrial pressure was higher in patients who underwent standard techniques at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. thus, bicaval ht was found to be safe, without surgically related complications, it provoked significantly less blood loss, and required less isoproterenol use. no significant advantages were observed in conduction disturbances and major arrhythmias or regarding the need for temporary or permanent pacemakers.
intervention strategies for spatial orientation disorders in dementia: a selective review cognitive decline associated with old age and consistent with the diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia is a unique clinical syndrome with characteristic phenomena and progression. the authors describe a global deterioration scale for the assessment of primary degenerative dementia and delineation of its stages. the authors have used the global deterioration scale successfully for more than 5 years and have validated it against behavioral, neuroanatomic, and neurophysiologic measures in patients with primary degenerative dementia.
macrophage migration inhibitory factor in acute adipose tissue inflammation understanding cellular response to environmental stress has broad implications for human disease. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) orchestrates the regulation of energy-generating and -consuming pathways, and protects the heart against ischaemic injury and apoptosis. a role for circulating hormones such as adiponectin and leptin in the activation of ampk has received recent attention. whether local autocrine and paracrine factors within target organs such as the heart modulate ampk is unknown. here we show that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif), an upstream regulator of inflammation, is released in the ischaemic heart, where it stimulates ampk activation through cd74, promotes glucose uptake and protects the heart during ischaemia-reperfusion injury. germline deletion of the mif gene impairs ischaemic ampk signalling in the mouse heart. human fibroblasts with a low-activity mif promoter polymorphism have diminished mif release and ampk activation during hypoxia. thus, mif modulates the activation of the cardioprotective ampk pathway during ischaemia, functionally linking inflammation and metabolism in the heart. we anticipate that genetic variation in mif expression may impact on the response of the human heart to ischaemia by the ampk pathway, and that diagnostic mif genotyping might predict risk in patients with coronary artery disease.
tissue-specific profiling reveals transcriptome alterations in arabidopsis mutants lacking morphological phenotypes[c][w] the rhd3 (root hair defective3) gene encodes a putative gtp-binding protein required for appropriate cell enlargement in arabidopsis. to obtain insight into the mechanisms of rhd3 regulation, we conducted a molecular genetic dissection of rhd3 gene expression and function. gene fusion and complementation studies show that the rhd3 gene is highly expressed throughout arabidopsis development and is controlled by two major regulatory regions. one regulatory region is located between −1,500 and −600 bp upstream of the rhd3 gene and is required for vascular tissue expression. the other region is intragenically located and includes the 558-bp first intron, which is responsible for high-level expression of rhd3 throughout the plant. the presence and location of this intron is essential for gene function because constructs lacking this intron or constructs with the intron in an abnormal position are unable to functionally complement therhd3 mutations. we also analyzed the role of otherrhd genes and the plant hormones auxin and ethylene inrhd3 regulation, and we determined that these act downstream or independently from the rhd3 pathway. this study shows that multiple levels of regulation are employed to ensure the appropriate expression of rhd3 throughout arabidopsis development.
differentiating bipolar type i and ii depression from unipolar depression: the role of clinical features, current symptoms and a past hypomanic symptoms checklist background young adults with early-onset major depressive disorder (mdd) may be at high risk of progression to bipolar disorder. although hypomanic symptoms are common in young people with depression, many do not reach the strict dsm-iv and icd-10 criteria for hypomania. we used an emerging innovative framework for bipolar spectrum to evaluate this question.   methods consecutive referrals to a psychiatric outpatient clinic at a university health service were assessed for recurrent episodes of depression. dsm-iv diagnoses were based on a scid-1 interview. we used two approaches to delineate bipolar spectrum. the first focused on bipolar spectrum disorder (bsd, as defined by ghaemi et al. [can. j. psychiatry 47 (2002) 125]), and the second on a symptoms perspective based on mdd with a history of hypomanic symptoms, using a 15-point hypomanic symptoms checklist with a cut-off > or =8 or more symptoms (modified from j. affect. disord. 73 (2003) 39 and j. affect. disord. 73 (2003) 73). data were also obtained on family history of affective disorder, course and number of episodes of depression, symptom severity, psychosocial functioning, suicidality and deliberate self-harm, and drug and alcohol use.   results high rates of bipolar and bipolar spectrum disorder were identified. under dsm-iv, 14 subjects (16.1%) had bipolar affective disorder and 73 subjects (83.9%) had recurrent mdd. depending on the method used to diagnose bipolar spectrum, between 47.1% and 77.0% of the total cohort could be so diagnosed. hypomanic symptom counts, irrespective of duration, yielded the highest estimates for bipolar spectrum. high rates of pharmacological hypomania were also identified: 12 subjects (16.4%) with recurrent mdd group reported this, and all could be diagnosed with bipolar spectrum.   limitations the reliability of using the 15-point hypomanic scale for the diagnostic assignments was not tested. all subjects were recruited from a university health service and, given the affluence of their parents, findings may not generalise to other populations. most importantly, because bipolar family history and pharmacological hypomania were part of the diagnostic criteria of the bsd group, they could not be used as external validators for ghaemi's bsd construct.   conclusions bipolar disorders emerge as extremely common in this cohort of young adults with recurrent depression. antidepressant-induced hypomania and high scores on a hypomanic symptoms checklist help to identify patients who are likely to have a bipolar spectrum illness, but who do not meet dsm-iv criteria for bipolar disorder. this is a preliminary study, and further evidence from external validating strategies are needed to verify the bipolar status of these patients in a larger and unselected cohort representing a broader socio-economic demographic profile.
proportions of bone marrow lymphocyte subsets at diagnosis may predict survival in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large b‐cell lymphoma independently of the international prognostic index sixty-one evaluable patients, 19 with advanced aplastic anemia and 42 with end stage hematological malignancies, were conditioned for marrow grafting with total body irradiation or cyclophosphamide, or a combination of both. marrow graft donors were siblings matched at the hl-a region and nonreactive in mixed leukocyte culture. all patients received methotrexate postgrafting to modify anticipated graft-versus-host disease (gvhd). forty-three of the 61 patients developed clinically recognizable gvhd. in seven gvhd was limited to the skin. in the remaining patients, skin involvement was more severe and was followed by gastrointestinal involvement manifested by anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption and/or liver involvement manifested by hepatomegaly, rises in serum glutamic oxaloacetic acid transaminase, and bilirubin. the severity of gvhd showed no correlation with the underlying disease, the conditioning regimen, or the day of onset after grafting. fourteen of 25 patients without gvhd or with only skin involvement are alive. by contrast, only 5 of 36 with severe gvhd are alive. twenty-six of the 36 patients with severe gvhd succumbed to infection, whereas only 4 of 25 without gvhd or with only skin involvement did so. the results show that despite histocompatibility matching and methotrexate therapy, gvhd remains a serious and often fatal complication of marrow transplantation.
pharmacology of currents underlying the different firing patterns of spinal sensory neurons and interneurons identified in vivo using multivariate analysis. the main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an n-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. the process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. that is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, s = {s1, s2, * *, sk} is a partition of en, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set si, then w2(s) = ff=isi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions s generated by the method. we say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. in addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. the k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. this problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. the k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. the rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. the extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4. the original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems in optimal classification (macqueen [9]) which represented special
objective measures of physical activity and cardiometabolic and endocrine biomarkers blood pressure in children has consistently been related to adult blood pressure, with implications for long-term prevention of cardiovascular disease. the epidemic of obesity in children has resulted in corresponding increases in childhood blood pressure. in this paper, the authors develop norms for childhood blood pressure among normal-weight children (body mass index <85th percentile based on centers for disease control and prevention guidelines) as a function of age, sex, and height, using data from 49,967 children included in the database of the national high blood pressure education program working group on high blood pressure in children and adolescents (the pediatric task force). the authors considered three types of models for pediatric blood pressure data, including polynomial regression, restricted cubic splines, and quantile regression, with the latter providing the best fit. the sex-specific norms presented here are a nonlinear function of both age and height and are generally slightly lower than previously developed norms based on pediatric task force data including both normal-weight and overweight children.
a complex multimodal 4-week residential treatment program significantlyreduces ptsd symptoms in child sexual abuse victims: the be brave ranch childhood sexual abuse (csa) involves multiple complex factors that make the evaluation of therapeutic interventions especially complicated. ptsd prevalence rates of csa are approximately 37 % -53 %. several other psychiatric sequelae of csa exist. csa appears to disrupt brain and body physiology. one co-located service delivery model reported a 52 % linkage rate of csa survivors with mental health treatment. this article reviews current literature on the treatment of csa, including psychosocial interventions, pharmacotherapy, and early preventative interventions. it also provides an update on the short- and long-term sequelae of csa and implications for future research directions. a literature search of papers published in the last 3 years was conducted using the keywords treatment, sexual abuse, childhood, epigenetics, resilience and review, and searching the following databases: psycinfo, pubmed, substance abuse and mental health services administration, and centers for disease control.

the mediating effect of context variation in mixed practice for transfer of basic science applying a previously learned concept to a novel problem is an important but difficult process called transfer. it is suggested that a commonsense analogy aids in transfer by linking novel concepts to familiar ones. how the context of practice affects transfer when learning using analogies is still unclear. this study investigated the effect of a commonsense analogy and context familiarity for transfer of physiological concepts. first year psychology students (n = 24) learned three concepts: starling’s law, laplace’s law, and laminar-turbulent flow. the control group saw standard explanations while the intervention group saw an additional commonsense analogy. the context of learning was the organ system used for two practice clinical cases which differed for all concepts. testing consisted of 12 new clinical cases. starling’s law cases used the organ system from practice while the other concepts presented in both novel and familiar organ systems. half of the sample repeated testing after 1 week delay. the outcome was ratings of explanations of cases on a 0–3 scale. the effect of analogy was significant (mean = 1.24 with, 0.86 without, f(1,22) = 4.26, p < 0.05) but not after delay (means of 1.08 and 0.75 respectively, f = (1,10), p = 0.06) there was significant effect for familiar context (same = 1.23 (starling), different = 0.68 (laplace) and 0.73 (laminar-turbulent flow) (f(2,44) = 5.14, p < 0.01). laplace’s law and laminar turbulent flow cases in the familiar organ system had means of 1.65 and 1.77 respectively compared to novel cases with means of 0.74 and 0.68 (f(1,22) = 35.64, p < 0.0001). similar effects were observed after delay. there was significant decay in performance after delay for all participants (immediate = 1.17, delayed = 0.91, f = 11.9 (1,10) p < 0.01). common analogies aid conceptual understanding necessary for transfer. despite conceptual aids, solving transfer problems is difficult.
participation of children with disabilities in taiwan: the gap between independence and frequency developmental disabilities are a heterogeneous group of chronic conditions that may result in substantial activity limitations. the type and number of limitations may vary by impairment characteristics. economic and social constraints may impact activity limitations beyond those attributable to their impairment. using the international classification of functioning (icf), disability, and health conceptual framework, this study tests the hypothesis that activity limitations in young adulthood are not inevitable consequences of childhood impairment. the metropolitan atlanta developmental disabilities follow-up study of young adults, a cohort of young adults ages 21-25, is used to examine the relationship between childhood impairment and activity limitations in young adulthood. for young adults with isolated impairment, activity limitations are not probable outcomes. this situation is not the case for those with severe intellectual disability and/or multiple impairments. the type and extent of activity limitations vary by impairment characteristics. with the goal of improving and preventing activity limitations in young adults with various types and severities of childhood impairment, additional research is needed to further identify areas for secondary and tertiary prevention of the consequences of childhood impairment. the conceptual framework of the icf provides a useful tool for testing hypotheses to pinpoint areas of intervention.
real-time integrated multi-object detection and tracking in video sequences using detection and mean shift based particle filters particle filter has recently received attention in computer vision applications due to attributes such as its ability to carry multiple hypotheses and its relaxation of the linearity assumption. its shortcoming is increase in complexity with state dimension. we present kernel particle filter as a variation of particle filter with improved sampling efficiency and performance in visual tracking. unlike existing methods that use stochastic or deterministic optimization procedures to find the modes in a likelihood function, we redistribute particles by invoking kernel-based representation of densities and introducing mean shift as an iterative mode-seeking procedure, in which particles move towards dominant modes while still maintaining as fair samples from the posterior. experiments on face and limb tracking show that the algorithm is superior to conventional particle filter in handling weak dynamic models and occlusions with 60% fewer particles in 3-9 dimensional spaces.
information caching strategy for cyber social computing based wireless networks understanding how users behave when they connect to social networking sites creates opportunities for better interface design, richer studies of social interactions, and improved design of content distribution systems. in this paper, we present a first of a kind analysis of user workloads in online social networks. our study is based on detailed clickstream data, collected over a 12-day period, summarizing http sessions of 37,024 users who accessed four popular social networks: orkut, myspace, hi5, and linkedin. the data were collected from a social network aggregator website in brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple social networks with a single authentication. our analysis of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. additionally, we crawled the social network topology of orkut, so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the social graph. our data analysis suggests insights into how users interact with friends in orkut, such as how frequently users visit their friends' or non-immediate friends' pages. in summary, our analysis demonstrates the power of using clickstream data in identifying patterns in social network workloads and social interactions. our analysis shows that browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. consequently, compared to using only crawled data, considering silent interactions like browsing friends' pages increases the measured level of interaction among users.
ground-dwelling spider diversity in rare european oak and yew woodlands and the impact of grazing we collected spiders from tree-bark, foliage and litter habitats in deciduous and conifer dominated stands in nw alberta (canada) to define these assemblages and consider their conservation significance. to establish habitat associations, we used indicator species analysis (isa) together with a species dominance metric (dv′) newly proposed here. of the 116 species collected, 78 were collected from bark. results support categorizing 16 species as true bark-dwellers, 16 as facultative bark-dwellers and 46 as accidental bark-dwellers or species of unknown association. species that were strong indicators of particular microhabitats in analyses restricted to bark habitats lost their indicator value when foliage and ground habitats were also considered, suggesting that bark habitats are critical for specific life-history functions. clubiona canadensis emerton 1980, callobius nomeus (chamberlin 1919), pocadicnemis americana millidge 1976 and enoplognatha intrepida (sørensen 1888) were the most common bark-dwelling species but their dominance varied among forest cover-types and trapping techniques. collecting period, forest cover-type, habitat, and trapping technique were generally important environmental variables influencing composition of bark-dwelling assemblages. although less important in structuring assemblages, tree status (dead or alive) and decay class were important for particular species. bark habitats are crucial for boreal forest spider assemblages and must be considered central to maintenance of spider diversity.
the fibronectin synergy site re-enforces cell adhesion and mediates a crosstalk between integrin classes fibrin(ogen) deficiency (fg-/-) was shown previously to be compatible with rapid thrombus growth within injured arterioles, but platelet fibronectin content was increased and newly formed thrombi were unstable. to further define the role of fibrin(ogen) in thrombus formation and stabilization, platelet biology was examined in mice expressing a form of fibrinogen that clots normally but lacks the gamma chain c-terminal binding site for alpha iib beta 3 (fg gamma delta 5). thrombus growth within the arterioles of fg gamma delta 5 mice appeared faster than in wild-type mice despite a far greater emboli formation. unlike fg-/- mice, the emboli were relatively small and released from the top of thrombi, rather than by fracture at the vessel wall. the fibronectin content in fg gamma delta 5 platelets was also dramatically increased through a beta 3 integrin-dependent mechanism. the following has been concluded: (1) fibrin formation contributes to, but is not sufficient for, the stabilization of arterial thrombi. platelet receptor engagement of the c-terminal of the fg gamma chain contributes to the stable incorporation of platelets into thrombi. (2) alternative ligands to fibrinogen can support efficient thrombus growth. (3) fibrinogen is internalized through alpha iib beta 3 engagement of the fibrinogen gamma chain element, and this interaction secondarily controls the fibronectin content of platelets.
a simulation of probabilistic wildfire risk components for the continental united states natural disturbances including wildfire, insects and disease are a growing threat to the remaining late successional forests in the pacific northwest, usa. these forests are a cornerstone of the region's ecological diversity and provide essential habitat to a number of rare terrestrial and aquatic species including the endangered northern spotted owl (strix occidentalis caurina). wildfires in particular have reduced the amount of late successional forests over the past decade, prompting land managers to expand investments in forest management in an attempt to slow losses and mitigate wildfire risk. much of the emphasis is focused specifically on late successional reserves established under the northwest forest plan to provide habitat for spotted owls. in this paper, we demonstrate a probabilistic risk analysis system for quantifying wildfire threats to spotted owl habitat and comparing the efficacy of fuel treatment scenarios. we used wildfire simulation methods to calculate spatially explicit probabilities of habitat loss for fuel treatment scenarios on a 70,245 ha study area in central oregon, usa. we simulated 1000 wildfires with randomly located ignitions and weather conditions that replicated a recent large fire within the study area. a flame length threshold for each spotted owl habitat stand was determined using the forest vegetation simulator and used to predict the proportion of fires that resulted in habitat loss. wildfire modeling revealed a strong spatial pattern in burn probability created by natural fuel breaks (lakes and lava flows). we observed a non-linear decrease in the probability of habitat loss with increasing treatment area. fuels treatments on a relatively minor percentage of the forested landscape (20%) resulted in a 44% decrease in the probability of spotted owl habitat loss averaged over all habitat stands. the modeling system advances the application of quantitative and probabilistic risk assessment for habitat and species conservation planning.
equivalences between git quotients of landau-ginzburg b-models the existence of a certain type of equivalence between triangulated categories of singularities for varieties of different dimensions is proved. this class of equivalences generalizes the so-called knorrer periodicity. as a consequence, equivalences between the categories of d-branes of type b on landau-ginzburg models of different dimensions are obtained.
the effect of high-intensity aerobic interval training on markers of systemic inflammation in sedentary populations purposelong-term physical activity is reported to improve chronic systemic inflammation, which provides protection against the ensuing development of chronic disease. accordingly, the present study assessed changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, aerobic capacity and body composition following 8 weeks of either small-sided games (ssg) or cycling (cyc) training compared to a sedentary control (con) condition.methodsthirty-three middle-aged, sedentary men were randomized into cyc (n = 11), ssg (n = 11), or con (n = 11) conditions. the cyc and ssg conditions trained 3 days/week for 8 weeks, whilst con maintained habitual activity and dietary patterns. pre- and post-intervention testing included a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, sub-maximal (80 % maximal heart rate) aerobic capacity (vo2) and fasting venous blood. venous blood measures for pro-inflammatory markers included c-reactive protein (crp), interleukin (il)-6, il-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and leptin; anti-inflammatory markers included il-10, il-1 receptor agonist, and adiponectin.resultsboth cyc and ssg increased submaximal power output and vo2 (p < 0.05), decreased total body fat-mass (tb-fm; p < 0.05), and crp (ssg, −0.45 ± 0.42 mg l−1; p = 0.008; cyc, −0.44 ± 0.59 mg l−1; p = 0.02). only ssg increased total body fat-free mass (tb-ffm; +1.1 ± 1.2 kg; p = 0.001) and decreased concentration of plasma il-6 (−0.69 ± 0.62 pg ml−1; p = 0.002) and leptin (−2,212 ± 2,531 ng ml−1; p = 0.014).conclusioncycling and ssg training were both effective at improving crp, vo2 and tb-fm. furthermore, ssg training has also shown to be an effective training approach in reducing il-6 and leptin and increasing muscle mass within sedentary, middle-aged men.

identification of conserved, centrosome-targeting ash domains in trappii complex subunits and trappc8 we evaluate 3d models of human nucleoside diphosphate kinase, mouse cellular retinoic acid binding protein i, and human eosinophil neurotoxin that were calculated by modeller, a program for comparative protein modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints. the models have good stereochemistry and are at least as similar to the crystallographic structures as the closest template structures. the largest errors occur in the regions that were not aligned correctly or where the template structures are not similar to the correct structure. these regions correspond predominantly to exposed loops, insertions of any length, and non‐conserved side chains. when a template structure with more than 40% sequence identity to the target protein is available, the model is likely to have about 90% of the mainchain atoms modeled with an rms deviation from the x‐ray structure of ≈ 1 å, in large part because the templates are likely to be that similar to the x‐ray structure of the target. this rms deviation is comparable to the overall differences between refined nmr and x‐ray crystallography structures of the same protein. © 1995 wiley‐liss, inc.
predictors of very late events after percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty in patients with mitral stenosis. introduction and aim percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty (pmv) is an effective treatment option for mitral stenosis (ms), but its success is assessed on the basis of clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in studies with relatively short follow-up. we aimed to characterize a cohort of patients undergoing pmv with long-term follow-up and to determine independent predictors of post-pmv mitral re-intervention and event-free survival.   methods we studied 91 consecutive patients with ms who underwent pmv with a median clinical follow-up duration of 99 months. two endpoints were considered: post-pmv mitral re-intervention (pmv or mitral surgery) and a composite clinical events endpoint including cardiovascular death, mitral valve re-intervention and hospital admission due to decompensated heart failure. we compared patients who required post-pmv mitral re-intervention with those who did not during follow-up.   results the study population included 83.5% females and mean age was 48.9±13.9 years. the 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-year rates of clinical event-free survival were 93.0±2.8%, 86.0±3.9%, 81.0±4.4%, 70.6±5.6%, and 68.4±5.8%, respectively. the 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-year rates of mitral re-intervention-free survival were 98.8±1.2%, 97.5±1.7%, 92.1±3.1%, 85.5±4.5%, and 85.5±4.5%, respectively. the median time to mitral re-intervention was 6.2 years. patients who required mitral re-intervention during follow-up were younger (43.3 vs. 51.2 years, p=0.04) and had higher pre- and post-pmv mitral gradient (14.9 vs. 11.5 mmhg, p=0.02 and 6.4 vs. 2.1 mmhg, p<0.001) and higher post-pmv mean pulmonary artery pressure (mpap) (30.0 vs. 23.2 mmhg, p=0.01). in a cox proportional hazards model, mpap ≥25 mmhg was the sole predictor of both mitral re-intervention (hr 5.639 [1.246-25.528], p=0.025) and clinical events (hr 3.622 [1.070-12.260], p=0.039).   conclusion in our population, immediate post-pmv mpap was the sole predictor of post-pmv mitral intervention. these findings may help identify patients in need of closer post-pmv follow-up.
stochastic simulation of periodic processes with arbitrary marginal distributions we describe a model for representing random vectors whose component random variables have arbitrary marginal distributions and correlation matrix, and describe how to generate data based upon this model for use in a stochastic simulation. the central idea is to transform a multivariate normal random vector into the desired random vector, so we refer to these vectors as having a norta (normal to anything) distribution. norta vectors are most useful when the marginal distributions of the component random variables are neither identical nor from the same family of distributions, and they are particularly valuable when the dimension of the random vector is greater than two. several numerical examples are provided.
a flexible, interactive software tool for fitting the parameters of neuronal models “brian” is a simulator for spiking neural networks (http://www.briansimulator.org). the focus is on making the writing of simulation code as quick and easy as possible for the user, and on flexibility: new and non-standard models are no more difficult to define than standard ones. this allows scientists to spend more time on the details of their models, and less on their implementation. neuron models are defined by writing differential equations in standard mathematical notation, facilitating scientific communication. brian is written in the python programming language, and uses vector-based computation to allow for efficient simulations. it is particularly useful for neuroscientific modelling at the systems level, and for teaching computational neuroscience.
comparison of us and uk rankings of lis journals a study of the perceived prestige of a core group of library journals by directors of arl libraries and library school deans reveals a prestige hierarchy for each group. although in rough agreement on the rating of two-thirds of the journals, the deans and directors differ significantly on the ratings of the remaining one-third. the subset of arl directors in institutions where librarians have faculty status as evidenced by tenure does not rate journals substantially more like library school deans than do arl directors as a whole, and library school deans are shown to agree much more as a group on their ratings than the arl directors.
patterns of public support for price increases on alcohol in the former soviet union. objective public views on alcohol policies have facilitated legislative change. given limited resources, however, policy makers and prevention advocates cannot make haphazard attempts to mobilize public resources. this investigation reports sociodemographic and individual traits predicting attitudes on alcohol policies designed to reduce underage alcohol consumption. previous studies have examined single-item measures of alcohol policy. we examined predictors of multi-item scales measuring five core dimensions of alcohol policy.   methods a survey of public attitudes on alcohol policies was administered to a us national probability sample of 7021 adults.   results women, infrequent drinkers, and adults with greater knowledge about or concern for youth exhibited the greatest support across five alcohol policy scales. older adults favored policies that restrict alcohol use in public places, whereas younger adults favored an increase in alcohol taxes to address underage alcohol use.   conclusions individual factors such as alcohol use frequency and concern for youth explained larger proportions of variance in alcohol policy attitudes than did sociodemographic factors. consistent with previous research, political orientation, parental status, employment status, and marital status did not predict attitudes on alcohol policy.
scheduling to optimize cache utilization for non-volatile main memories phase-change random access memory (pcram) is an emerging memory technology with attractive features, such as fast read access, high density, and non-volatility. because of these attractive properties, pcram is regarded as a promising candidate for future universal memories, and system-level designers could open up new design opportunities by leveraging this new memory technology. however, the majority of the pcram research has been at the device level, and system-level design space exploration using pcram is still in its infancy due to the lack of high-level modeling tools for pcram-based caches and memories. in this paper, we present a pcram model, called pcramsim, to bridge the gap between the device-level and system-level research on pcram technology. the model is validated against industrial pcram prototypes. this new pcramsim tool is expected to help boost pcram-related studies such as next-generation memory subsystems.
nls-tstm : a novel and fast nonlinear image classification method we survey and extend a general approach to analyzing the convergence and the rate of convergence of feasible descent methods that does not require any nondegeneracy assumption on the problem. this approach is based on a certain error bound for estimating the distance to the solution set and is applicable to a broad class of methods.
dynamic refraction stereo the problem we are addressing in alvey project mmi149 is that of using computer vision to understand the unconstrained 3d world, in which the viewed scenes will in general contain too wide a diversity of objects for topdown recognition techniques to work. for example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in figure 1. the solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. by extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3d analogues of these features can be constructed.
cognitive function, iron status, and hemoglobin concentration in obese dieting women in a study designed to assess the effects of short-term food deprivation on cognitive function, a sample of female subjects (n = 21) was tested on a number of measures of cognitive function after three levels of food deprivation (miss one meal, miss two meals or miss all food for 24 h prior to testing) and a condition in which they ate normally for 24 h prior to testing. there was found to be no significant effects of food deprivation on sustained attention, attentional focus, simple reaction time or immediate memory. however, performance on a low processing load tapping task was significantly poorer when the subjects were deprived of food for 24 h prior to testing, and heart rate was significantly higher when they were non-deprived. these results stand in contrast to the impairments in cognitive function previously found to be associated with spontaneous dieting behaviour (using essentially the same task battery).
motivational modulation of self-initiated and externally triggered movement speed induced by threat of shock: experimental evidence for paradoxical kinesis in parkinson’s disease we present a clinimetric assessment of the movement disorder society (mds)‐sponsored revision of the unified parkinson's disease rating scale (mds‐updrs). the mds‐udprs task force revised and expanded the updrs using recommendations from a published critique. the mds‐updrs has four parts, namely, i: non‐motor experiences of daily living; ii: motor experiences of daily living; iii: motor examination; iv: motor complications. twenty questions are completed by the patient/caregiver. item‐specific instructions and an appendix of complementary additional scales are provided. movement disorder specialists and study coordinators administered the updrs (55 items) and mds‐updrs (65 items) to 877 english speaking (78% non‐latino caucasian) patients with parkinson's disease from 39 sites. we compared the two scales using correlative techniques and factor analysis. the mds‐updrs showed high internal consistency (cronbach's alpha = 0.79–0.93 across parts) and correlated with the original updrs (ρ = 0.96). mds‐updrs across‐part correlations ranged from 0.22 to 0.66. reliable factor structures for each part were obtained (comparative fit index > 0.90 for each part), which support the use of sum scores for each part in preference to a total score of all parts. the combined clinimetric results of this study support the validity of the mds‐updrs for rating pd. © 2008 movement disorder society
ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 1 interacting multiview tracker the core component of most modern trackers is a discriminative classifier, tasked with distinguishing between the target and the surrounding environment. to cope with natural image changes, this classifier is typically trained with translated and scaled sample patches. such sets of samples are riddled with redundancies—any overlapping pixels are constrained to be the same. based on this simple observation, we propose an analytic model for datasets of thousands of translated patches. by showing that the resulting data matrix is circulant, we can diagonalize it with the discrete fourier transform, reducing both storage and computation by several orders of magnitude. interestingly, for linear regression our formulation is equivalent to a correlation filter, used by some of the fastest competitive trackers. for kernel regression, however, we derive a new kernelized correlation filter (kcf), that unlike other kernel algorithms has the exact same complexity as its linear counterpart. building on it, we also propose a fast multi-channel extension of linear correlation filters, via a linear kernel, which we call dual correlation filter (dcf). both kcf and dcf outperform top-ranking trackers such as struck or tld on a 50 videos benchmark, despite running at hundreds of frames-per-second, and being implemented in a few lines of code (algorithm 1). to encourage further developments, our tracking framework was made open-source.
the health system and population health implications of large-scale diabetes screening in india: a microsimulation model of alternative approaches summarytype 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance are associated with centrally-distributed obesity. these disturbances are especially prevalent in people of south asian (indian, pakistani and bangladeshi) descent. we examined the relationship of glucose intolerance to body fat pattern in a population survey of 2936 men and 537 women of south asian and european origin living in london, uk. in both groups glucose intolerance (defined as diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance) was more strongly associated with waist-hip girth ratio than with skinfolds or body mass index. the associations between body mass index and glucose intolerance were fully accounted for by waist-hip ratio. in european men with normal glucose tolerance fasting insulin levels were more strongly correlated with body mass index than with waist-hip ratio. physical activity scores were lower in south asians than in europeans but no statistically significant associations between glucose intolerance and low physical activity were detectable. leisure-time physical activity scores were inversely correlated with 2 h insulin levels in both groups. in contrast with other studies these results suggest that a specific effect of intra-abdominal fat deposition underlies the association between glucose intolerance and obesity. the association between hyperinsulinaemia and obesity is less specific for centrally-distributed fat. when measured appropriately waist-hip ratio is the most valid anthropometric index for identifying individuals whose obesity predisposes them to glucose intolerance.
volatility of ise and business cycle this paper uses a disaggregated approach to study the volatility of common stocks at the market, industry, and firm levels. over the period from 1962 to 1997 there has been a noticeable increase in firm-level volatility relative to market volatility. accordingly, correlations among individual stocks and the explanatory power of the market model for a typical stock have declined, whereas the number of stocks needed to achieve a given level of diversification has increased. all the volatility measures move together countercyclically and help to predict gdp growth. market volatility tends to lead the other volatility series. factors that may be responsible for these findings are suggested.
exercising self-control increases approach motivation. these studies investigated self-regulation and subjective experience of time from the perspective of the regulatory resource model. studies 1-2 showed that participants who were instructed to regulate their emotions while viewing a film clip perceived that the film lasted longer than participants who did not regulate their emotions. in study 3, participants provided time estimates during a resource-depleting or nondepleting task. subsequent task persistence was measured. time perceptions mediated the effect of initial self-regulation on subsequent self-regulated performance. in study 4, participants performed either a resource-depleting or a nondepleting thought-listing task and then performed a different regulatorytask. compared with nondepleted participants, depleted participants persisted less on the 2nd task but estimated that they had persisted longer. subjective time estimates statistically accounted for reduced persistence after depletion. together, results indicate people believe that self-regulatory endeavors last overly long, a belief that may result in abandonment of further self-control.

species associations in a species-rich subtropical forest were not well-explained by stochastic geometry of biodiversity the assertion that the spatial location of different species is independent of each other is fundamental in major ecological theories such as neutral theory that describes a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. however, this assertion has rarely been tested. here we use techniques of spatial point pattern analysis to conduct a comprehensive test of the independence assertion by analysing data from three large forest plots with different species richness: a species-rich tropical forest at barro colorado island (panama), a tropical forest in sinharaja (sri lanka), and a temperate forest in changbaishan (china). we hypothesize that stochastic dilution effects owing to increasing species richness overpower signals of species associations, thereby yielding approximate species independence. indeed, the proportion of species pairs showing: (i) no significant interspecific association increased with species richness, (ii) segregation decreased with species richness, and (iii) small-scale interspecific interaction decreased with species richness. this suggests that independence may indeed be a good approximation in the limit of very species-rich communities. our findings are a step towards a better understanding of factors governing species-rich communities and we propose a hypothesis to explain why species placement in species-rich communities approximates independence.
inferring neuronal dynamics from calcium imaging data using biophysical models and bayesian inference spontaneous synaptic events can be difficult to detect when their amplitudes are close to the background noise level. here we report a sensitive new technique for automatic detection of small asynchronous events. a waveform with the time course of a typical synaptic event (a template) is slid along the current or voltage trace and optimally scaled to fit the data at each position. a detection criterion is calculated based on the optimum scaling factor and the quality of the fit. an event is detected when this criterion crosses a threshold level. the algorithm automatically compensates for changes in recording noise. the sensitivity and selectivity of the method were tested using real and simulated data, and the influence of the template parameter settings was investigated. its performance was comparable to that obtained by visual event detection, and it was more sensitive than previously described threshold detection techniques. under typical recording conditions, all fast synaptic events with amplitudes of at least three times the noise standard deviation (3 sigma) could be detected, as could 75% of events with amplitudes of 2 sigma. the scaled template technique is implemented within a commercial data analysis application and can be applied to many standard electrophysiological data file formats.
contextual statistics of space-time ordered features for human action recognition local image features or interest points provide compact and abstract representations of patterns in an image. in this paper, we extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for interpretation of spatio-temporal events.to detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the harris and förstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. we estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events by maximizing a normalized spatio-temporal laplacian operator over spatial and temporal scales. to represent the detected events, we then compute local, spatio-temporal, scale-invariant n-jets and classify each event with respect to its jet descriptor. for the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how a video representation in terms of local space-time features allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic cluttered backgrounds.
quadriceps strength in patients with isolated cartilage defects of the knee: results of isokinetic strength measurements and their correlation with clinical and functional results objectives to identify patient-assessed health instruments specific to the knee and review evidence for reliability, validity and responsiveness.   methods instruments were identified through systematic searches of the literature. information relating to instrument content, patient population, reliability, validity and responsiveness was extracted from published papers.   results the 16 instruments that met the inclusion criteria varied in length from 4 to 42 items. the majority form a single index; six produce a profile of scores. eight have been evaluated in patients with a variety of knee problems. all instruments have satisfactory internal or test-retest reliability. however, there is limited empirical support for the health domains of six instruments. patients informed the development of items within just five instruments. few authors gave explicit consideration to the size of expected relationships in tests of construct validity. eleven instruments have evidence for responsiveness to changes in health. the minimally important difference was not determined for any of the instruments.   conclusions in the absence of comparative evidence, the large number of patient-assessed instruments for knee problems makes instrument selection difficult. the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (koos), knee pain scale and oxford knee score have good evidence for reliability, content validity and construct validity. the koos and oxford instruments also have evidence for responsiveness. the instruments have not been evaluated for all knee problems, and instrument appropriateness, including content relevance, must be assessed before application. the comparative evaluation of instruments is recommended.
image-based building regularization using structural linear features many applications in computer graphics require complex, highly detailed models. however, the level of detail actually necessary may vary considerably. to control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed models. we have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. the algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. by contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. this can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. in order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models. cr categories: i.3.5 [computer graphics]: computational geometry and object modeling—surface and object representations
factors associated with domestic violence: a cross-sectional survey among women in jeddah, saudi arabia we describe the individual and household characteristics associated with intimate partner violence (ipv) in the philippines, using data from the cebu longitudinal health and nutrition survey (clhns). we also examine 56 in-depth interview transcripts to explore the context of ipv. we focus our analysis on patterns of household decision-making as a measure of the interpersonal dynamics between husbands and wives. thirteen percent of women in our sample reported ipv. while economic factors are often implicated in the cycle of violence in households, we find employment status and relative earnings do not predict ipv. lower levels of household wealth and urban residence are associated with a higher likelihood of ipv. patterns of household decision-making emerge as strong predictors of violence. the greater the number of decision-making domains men dominate, the more likely they are to use ipv; however, we also find that when women dominate household decisions, they are also more likely to experience ipv. only 6% of women reported ipv when all household decisions were made jointly compared to 25% when no decisions were made jointly.
lack of association between iron status at birth and growth of preterm infants. the ballard maturational score was refined and expanded to achieve greater accuracy and to include extremely premature neonates. to test validity, accuracy, interrater reliability, and optimal postnatal age at examination, the resulting new ballard score (nbs) was assessed for 578 newly born infants and the results were analyzed. gestational ages ranged from 20 to 44 weeks and postnatal ages at examination ranged from birth to 96 hours. in 530 infants, gestational age by last menstrual period was confirmed by agreement within 2 weeks with gestational age by prenatal ultrasonography (c-glmp). for these infants, correlation between gestational age by nbs and c-glmp was 0.97. mean differences between gestational age by nbs and c-glmp were 0.32 +/- 1.58 weeks and 0.15 +/- 1.46 weeks among the extremely premature infants (less than 26 weeks) and among the total population, respectively. correlations between the individual criteria and c-glmp ranged from 0.72 to 0.82. interrater reliability of nbs, as determined by correlation between raters who rated the same subgroup of infants, ws 0.95. for infants less than 26 weeks of gestational age, the greatest validity (97% within 2 weeks of c-glmp) was seen when the examination was performed before 12 hours of postnatal age. for infants at least 26 weeks of gestational age, percentages of agreement with c-glmp remained constant, averaging 92% for all postnatal age categories up to 96 hours. the nbs is a valid and accurate gestational assessment tool for extremely premature infants and remains valid for the entire newborn infant population.
designing a set of safety standards for surgical short term medical missions purpose the authors review their experiences during multiple cleft surgical missions to rural bangladesh from 2006 to 2008. a significant number of patients who underwent primary palatoplasty or cheiloplasty were of adult age or size. adult primary cleft lip and palate repair is often more challenging than repair at the standard age of fewer than 2 years. this patient population is rarely seen in the united states, but may be treated more often by american surgeons during surgical missions to the developing world. this report discusses the experiences of the authors' treatment of cleft lips and palates in rural bangladesh.   patients and methods one hundred forty-six cleft-lip and cleft-palate patients were treated during 3 missions to rural bangladesh, from 2006 to 2008. thirty-three (23%) patients were of adult size, and aged 13 to 35 years. one hundred thirteen (77%) patients were aged 12 years or younger. unilateral cleft lips were repaired with a millard advancement-rotation technique. bilateral cleft lips were repaired via the 1-stage procedure advocated by mulliken and salyer. cleft palates were repaired using a 2-finger flap method.   results overall, 8 of 146 patients (5.5%) had nonlife-threatening complications (infection or wound dehiscence) requiring subsequent revision surgery. the adult-sized patients had clefts of significantly increased size secondary to patient growth, as well as maxillary expansion transversely and anteriorly. adult cleft-lip repair required significant soft-tissue dissection to close the cleft adequately, and ensure symmetry to the upper lip and alar bases. however, this procedure sometimes resulted in placement of the lip cicatrix in an anatomically disadvantageous position. in addition, with the increased transverse dimension of the adult cleft palate, tension-free 3-layer closure was difficult. again, aggressive dissection of the soft tissue was required: the nasal and muscular layers were closed without much tension, but oral closure was often under tension, requiring the assistance of dermal biomaterials to bolster the repair.   conclusions patients in the developing world often have limited access to specialized health care, and may not realize that cleft lips and palates can be repaired. as a result, there is an increased incidence of unrepaired clefts in adult-sized individuals in this part of the globe. the american surgeon may encounter these patients during surgical missions. the surgeon should be prepared to repair adult patients with clefts that are significantly enlarged in all 3 dimensions. closure will require significant soft-tissue dissection as well as the use of biomaterials as needed to repair wide cleft palates.
emergence of drug resistance is associated with an increased risk of death among patients first starting haart standard methods for survival analysis, such as the time-dependent cox model, may produce biased effect estimates when there exist time-dependent confounders that are themselves affected by previous treatment or exposure. marginal structural models are a new class of causal models the parameters of which are estimated through inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting; these models allow for appropriate adjustment for confounding. we describe the marginal structural cox proportional hazards model and use it to estimate the causal effect of zidovudine on the survival of human immunodeficiency virus-positive men participating in the multicenter aids cohort study. in this study, cd4 lymphocyte count is both a time-dependent confounder of the causal effect of zidovudine on survival and is affected by past zidovudine treatment. the crude mortality rate ratio (95% confidence interval) for zidovudine was 3.6 (3.0-4.3), which reflects the presence of confounding. after controlling for baseline cd4 count and other baseline covariates using standard methods, the mortality rate ratio decreased to 2.3 (1.9-2.8). using a marginal structural cox model to control further for time-dependent confounding due to cd4 count and other time-dependent covariates, the mortality rate ratio was 0.7 (95% conservative confidence interval = 0.6-1.0). we compare marginal structural models with previously proposed causal methods.
pon1 is a longevity gene: results of a meta-analysis aims this paper highlights the lack of consideration that is given to power in the health and social sciences, which is a continuing problem with both single study research and more importantly for meta-analysis.   background the power of a study is the probability that it will lead to a statistically significant result. by ignoring power the single study researcher makes it difficult to get negative results published and therefore affects meta-analysis through publication bias. researchers using meta-analysis, who also ignore power, then compound the problem by including studies with low power that are more likely to show significant effects.   method a simple means of calculating an easily understood measure of effect size from a contingency table is demonstrated in this paper. a computer programme for determining the power of a study is recommended and a method of reflecting the adequacy of the power of the studies in a meta-analysis is suggested. an example of this calculation from a meta-analytic study on intravenous magnesium, which produced inaccurate results, is provided.   conclusion it is demonstrated that incorporating power analysis into this meta-analysis would have prevented misleading conclusions being reached. some suggestions are made for changes in the protocol of meta-analytic studies, which highlight the importance of power analysis.
the importance of geographic access for the impact of microfinance propensity score matching (psm) has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. it is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. once the researcher has decided to use psm, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. to begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. furthermore, questions like "what to do if there is choice-based sampling?" or "when to measure effects?" can be important in empirical studies. finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. the aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use psm for evaluation purposes.
“minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy. initial experience in a general surgery department” backgroundminimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (mivat) is safe and effective for selected patients, but its advantages are not clearly defined. results of mivat for follicular neoplasms at a single institution were retrospectively evaluated to define its advantages or disadvantages.methodsbetween october 2002 and may 2004, 22 patients underwent mivat. twenty-six patients who underwent conventional thyroidectomy during the same time period served as matched controls. operative times, pathologic findings, complications, analgesic requirements, and incision lengths were retrospectively evaluated.resultsfour mivat and three conventional surgery patients underwent total thyroidectomy. eighteen mivat and 23 conventional patients underwent hemithyroidectomy. the operative time (mean ± sem) for hemithyroidectomy was 102 ± 4 minutes for mivat and 86 ± 3 minutes for conventional surgery (p < .05). in subgroup analysis that excluded patients with thyroiditis, operative times were not significantly different: mivat, 99 ± 4 minutes; conventional, 88 ± 4 minutes. the mean incision length was 2.3 ± .5 cm in the mivat group. conventional thyroidectomy was performed through a 4- to 5-cm incision. the average amount of narcotic used was not significantly different (intravenous, 9.9 ± 3.1 mg [mivat] vs. 12.4 ± 3.8 mg; oral, 10.3 ± 4.2 mg [mivat] vs. 3.5 ± 2.0 mg). the conventional group received more cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor (527 ± 9 mg vs. 187 ± 84 mg; p < .05). one patient in each group experienced transient hoarseness. there were no cases of permanent hypoparathyroidism or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in either group.conclusionsmivat is as safe and effective as conventional thyroidectomy and is associated with similar narcotic analgesic requirements, but it can be performed through smaller incisions. operative times were significantly longer for mivat, but when patients with thyroiditis were excluded, operative times were not significantly different.
evaluation of the sift object recognition method for a mobile robotic platform we propose a novel approach to point matching under large viewpoint and illumination changes that are suitable for accurate object pose estimation at a much lower computational cost than state-of-the-art methods. most of these methods rely either on using ad hoc local descriptors or on estimating local affine deformations. by contrast, we treat wide baseline matching of key points as a classification problem, in which each class corresponds to the set of all possible views of such a point. given one or more images of a target object, we train the system by synthesizing a large number of views of individual key points and by using statistical classification tools to produce a compact description of this view set. at run-time, we rely on this description to decide to which class, if any, an observed feature belongs. this formulation allows us to use a classification method to reduce matching error rates, and to move some of the computational burden from matching to training, which can be performed beforehand. in the context of pose estimation, we present experimental results for both planar and non-planar objects in the presence of occlusions, illumination changes, and cluttered backgrounds. we show that the method is both reliable and suitable for initializing real-time applications.
feasibility of internet-based post-secondary nutrition education: incorporating features of the mediterranean diet. objective: to evaluate dietary habits and nutritional status of spanish school children and adolescents, and their relationship with the mediterranean diet.design: cross-sectional study by face-to-face interview.setting: free living children and adolescents of all spanish regions.subjects: a random sample of 3166 people aged 6–24 y.methods: home interviews conducted by a team of 43 dietitians included 24-h recalls (a second 24-h recall in 25% of the sample) and a short frequency questionnaire to determine the quality of the mediterranean diet (kidmed).results: the participation rate was 68%. in general, the adequacy of the mediterranean diet rose with increased mean intakes of the majority of vitamins and minerals and decreased percentages of inadequate intakes (<2/3 of the rni) for calcium, magnesium, vitamin b6 and c in both sexes, and iron and vitamin a only in females.conclusions: this study demonstrates that the mediterranean diet contributes to nutritional quality, and also shows concomitant risks as the mediterranean diet deteriorates.sponsorship: kellogg's, foundation for the advancement of the mediterranean diet.
the amara corpus: building resources for translating the web's educational content we propose a new phrase-based translation model and decoding algorithm that enables us to evaluate and compare several, previously proposed phrase-based translation models. within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based models. our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems.
nuclear import of isoforms of the cytomegalovirus kinase pul97 is mediated by differential activity of nls1 and nls2 both acting through classical importin-α binding. antiviral therapy of primary and recurrent infections with human cytomegalovirus is reserved for severe manifestations and faces several limitations. presently candidates for novel drugs with lower adverse side effects and a minimized frequency of resistance formation are under investigation. here we demonstrate that artesunate, an antimalaria drug with highly valuable pharmacological properties, possesses antiviral activity. a concentration-dependent inhibition of the replication of human cytomegaloviruses with wild-type phenotype was demonstrated in several cell lines. inhibition was quantified using recombinant green fluorescent protein expressing virus variants. the ic50 values were in the same range for ganciclovir-sensitive and ganciclovir-resistant human cytomegalovirus, as calculated with 5.8±0.4 µm and 6.9±0.2 µm, respectively. this indicated a strong antiviral potential and a lack of cross-resistance. the optimal antiviral concentrations of artesunate were separable from those inducing cytotoxicity. in addition, the replication of viruses from three genera was seen to be artesunate-sensitive to varying degrees. this suggests a mechanism linked to cellular activation pathways. both the protein levels and the dna binding activity of the two virus-induced cellular transcription factors sp1 and nf-κb were found to be markedly reduced in the presence of artesunate. we also analyzed the cellular signaling kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase, required for the activation of factors such as sp1 and nf-κb in infected fibroblasts. the phosphorylation of two downstream effectors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, akt and p70s6k, was markedly inhibited in the presence of artesunate. thus, artesunate possesses attractive antiviral characteristics which are suggestively based on the interference with essential steps in the host cell kinase cascades.
phosphatase pp2a and microtubule pulling forces disassemble centrosomes during mitotic exit genetic and genome-wide rnai approaches available in c. elegans, combined with tools for visualizing subcellular events with high-resolution, have led to increasing adoption of the early c. elegans embryo as a model for mechanistic and functional genomic analysis of cellular processes. however, a limitation of this system has been the impermeability of the embryo eggshell, which has prevented the routine use of small molecule inhibitors. here, we present a method to permeabilize and immobilize embryos for acute inhibitor treatment in conjunction with live imaging. to identify a means to permeabilize the eggshell, we used a dye uptake assay to screen a set of 310 candidate genes defined by a combination of bioinformatic criteria. this screen identified 20 genes whose inhibition resulted in >75% eggshell permeability, and 3 that permeabilized embryos with minimal deleterious effects on embryo production and early embryonic development. to mount permeabilized embryos for acute drug addition in conjunction with live imaging, we combined optimized inhibition of one of these genes with the use of a microfabricated chamber that we designed. we demonstrate that these two developments enable the temporally controlled introduction of inhibitors for mechanistic studies. this method should also open new avenues of investigation by allowing profiling and specificity-testing of inhibitors through comparison with genome-wide phenotypic datasets.
design automation and test solutions for digital microfluidic biochips microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize clinical diagnosis, dna sequencing, and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. most microfluidic biochips today are based on the principle of continuous fluid flow and they rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves. we focus here on the automated design of “digital” droplet-based microfluidic biochips. in contrast to conventional continuous-flow systems, digital microfluidics offers dynamic reconfigurability; groups of cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. we present a simulated annealing-based technique for module placement in such biochips. the placement procedure not only addresses chip area, but also considers fault tolerance, which allows a microfluidic module to be relocated elsewhere in the system when a single cell is detected to be faulty. simulation results are presented for case studies involving the polymerase chain reaction and multiplexed in vitro clinical diagnostics.
cellular-based modeling of oscillatory dynamics in brain networks the ionic conductances underlying membrane potential oscillations of hippocampal ca1 interneurons located near the border between stratum lacunosum-moleculare and stratum radiatum (lm) were investigated using whole cell current-clamp recordings in rat hippocampal slices. at 22 degrees c, when lm cells were depolarized near spike threshold by current injection, 91% of cells displayed 2-5 hz oscillations in membrane potential, which caused rhythmic firing. at 32 degrees c, mean oscillation frequency increased to 7.1 hz. oscillations were voltage dependent and were eliminated by hyperpolarizing cells 6-10 mv below spike threshold. blockade of ionotropic glutamate and gaba synaptic transmission did not affect oscillations, indicating that they were not synaptically driven. oscillations were eliminated by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that na+ currents generate the depolarizing phase of oscillations. oscillations were not affected by blocking ca2+ currents with cd2+ or ca2+-free acsf or by blocking the hyperpolarization-activated current (ih) with cs+. both ba2+ and a low concentration of 4-aminopyridine (4-ap) reduced oscillations but tea did not. theta-frequency oscillations were much less common in interneurons located in stratum oriens. intrinsic membrane potential oscillations in lm cells of the ca1 region thus involve an interplay between inward na+ currents and outward k+ currents sensitive to ba2+ and 4-ap. these oscillations may participate in rhythmic inhibition and synchronization of pyramidal neurons during theta activity in vivo.
altered functional connectivity patterns of the insular subregions in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcmri) studies constitute a growing proportion of functional brain imaging publications. this approach detects temporal correlations in spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (bold) signal oscillations while subjects rest quietly in the scanner. although distinct resting-state networks related to vision, language, executive processing, and other sensory and cognitive domains have been identified, considerable skepticism remains as to whether resting-state functional connectivity maps reflect neural connectivity or simply track bold signal correlations driven by nonneural artifact. here we combine diffusion tensor imaging (dti) tractography with resting-state fcmri to test the hypothesis that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity. these 2 modalities were used to investigate connectivity within the default mode network, a set of brain regions--including medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc), medial temporal lobes (mtls), and posterior cingulate cortex (pcc)/retropslenial cortex (rsc)--implicated in episodic memory processing. using seed regions from the functional connectivity maps, the dti analysis revealed robust structural connections between the mtls and the retrosplenial cortex whereas tracts from the mpfc contacted the pcc (just rostral to the rsc). the results demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity and that combining modalities can enrich our understanding of these canonical brain networks.
nuclear t-star protein expression correlates with her2 status, hormone receptor negativity and prolonged recurrence free survival in primary breast cancer and decreased cancer cell growth in vitro mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) is an aggressive lymphoid malignancy for which better treatment strategies are needed. to identify potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, a signature consisting of mcl-associated genes was selected based on a comprehensive gene expression analysis of malignant and normal b cells. the corresponding protein epitope signature tags were identified and used to raise monospecific, polyclonal antibodies, which were subsequently analyzed on paraffin-embedded sections of malignant and normal tissue. in this study, we demonstrate that the initial selection strategy of mcl-associated genes successfully allows identification of protein antigens either uniquely expressed or overexpressed in mcl compared with normal lymphoid tissues. we propose that genome-based, affinity proteomics, using protein epitope signature tag-induced antibodies, is an efficient way to rapidly identify a number of disease-associated protein candidates of both previously known and unknown identities.

on the portability of trained machine learning classifiers for early application identification the early detection of applications associated with tcp flows is an essential step for network security and traffic engineering. the classic way to identify flows, i.e. looking at port numbers, is not effective anymore. on the other hand, state-of-the-art techniques cannot determine the application before the end of the tcp flow. in this editorial, we propose a technique that relies on the observation of the first five packets of a tcp connection to identify the application. this result opens a range of new possibilities for online traffic classification.
hepatic pedicle clamping during hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases: no impact on survival or hepatic recurrence objective there is a need for clearly defined and widely applicable clinical criteria for the selection of patients who may benefit from hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. such criteria would also be useful for stratification of patients in clinical trials for this disease.   methods clinical, pathologic, and outcome data for 1001 consecutive patients undergoing liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer between july 1985 and october 1998 were examined. these resections included 237 trisegmentectomies, 394 lobectomies, and 370 resections encompassing less than a lobe. the surgical mortality rate was 2.8%.   results the 5-year survival rate was 37%, and the 10-year survival rate was 22%. seven factors were found to be significant and independent predictors of poor long-term outcome by multivariate analysis: positive margin (p = 0.004), extrahepatic disease (p = 0.003), node-positive primary (p = 0.02), disease-free interval from primary to metastases <12 months (p = 0.03), number of hepatic tumors >1 (p = 0.0004), largest hepatic tumor >5 cm (p = 0.01), and carcinoembryonic antigen level >200 ng/ml (p = 0.01). when the last five of these criteria were used in a preoperative scoring system, assigning one point for each criterion, the total score was highly predictive of outcome (p < 0.0001). no patient with a score of 5 was a long-term survivor.   conclusion resection of hepatic colorectal metastases may produce long-term survival and cure. long-term outcome can be predicted from five criteria that are readily available for all patients considered for resection. patients with up to two criteria can have a favorable outcome. patients with three, four, or five criteria should be considered for experimental adjuvant trials. studies of preoperative staging techniques or of adjuvant therapies should consider using such a score for stratification of patients.
topology optimization of inertia driven dosing units a calculation is given of the viscous force, exerted by a flowing fluid on a dense swarm of particles. the model underlying these calculations is that of a spherical particle embedded in a porous mass. the flow through this porous mass is decribed by a modification of darcy's equation. such a modification was necessary in order to obtain consistent boundary conditions. a relation between permeability and particle size and density is obtained. our results are compared with an experimental relation due to carman.
a new environmentally resistant cell type from dictyostelium introduction of restriction enzyme along with linearized plasmid results in integration of plasmid dna at genomic restriction sites in a high proportion of the resulting transformants. we have found that electroporating bamhi or ecori together with pyr5-6 plasmids cut with the same enzyme stimulates the efficiency of transformation in dictyostelium discoideum more than 20-fold over the rate seen when plasmid dna alone is introduced. restriction enzyme-mediated integration generates insertions into genomic restriction sites in an apparently random manner, some of which cause mutations. about 1 in 400 of the dictyostelium transformants displayed arrested or aberrant development. the integrated plasmid, along with flanking genomic dna, was excised from some of these mutants, cloned in escherichia coli, and used to transform other dictyostelium cells. homologous recombination within the flanking sequences resulted in the same phenotypes displayed by the original mutants, directly demonstrating that the affected genes were responsible for the specific morphological phenotypes. this method of insertional mutagenesis should be useful for tagging, and subsequent cloning, of many developmentally important genes that can be identified by their mutant phenotypes.
a randomized clinical trial of berberine hydrochloride in patients with diarrhea‐predominant irritable bowel syndrome objective:there has been growing interest in the investigation of health-related quality of life (hrqol) among patients with gastrointestinal (gi) disorders. we recently reported on the development and preliminary validation of the ibs-qol, a specific quality-of-life measure for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). the aim of this study was to determine the longitudinal construct validity (responsiveness) of the ibs-qol.methods:female patients enrolled in a multicenter treatment trial for functional bowel disorders were studied pre- and posttreatment with the ibs-qol and other health status measures. based on the response to treatment for several variables (pain/14-day score, daily function, and days in bed/3 months), patients were stratified into responders, partial responders, and nonresponders. change scores in the ibs-qol were then statistically compared with changes in the other variables to determine their correlation and whether responders were significantly different from non- and partial responders on the ibs-qol.results:there was a significant correlation between change scores on the ibs-qol and the other measures of treatment effect (pain/14 days, r = 0.25, p < 0.002; sickness impact profile [sip] total score, r = 0.28, p < 0.0004). in addition, the ibs-qol scores significantly differentiated responders from nonresponders for most of the variables tested (regression trend test for pain/14 days, p < 0.04; sip total, p < 0.0001; sip physical, p < 0.0001; sip psychosocial, p < 0.002, and sip eating, p < 0.04).conclusion:the ibs-qol is responsive to treatment in a referral-based clinical population of patients with functional bowel disorders.
considering transposable element diversification in de novo annotation approaches the sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. these modifications are incorporated into a new program, clustal w which is freely available.
functional role of entorhinal cortex in working memory processing recordings from brain regions involved in memory function show dual oscillations in which each cycle of a low-frequency theta oscillation (5-8 hz) is subdivided into about seven subcycles by high frequency gamma oscillations (20-60 hz). it has been proposed (lisman and idiart 1995) that such networks are a multiplexed short-term memory (stm) buffer that can actively maintain about seven memories, a capability of human stm. a memory is encoded by a subset of principal neurons that fire synchronously in a particular gamma subcycle. firing is maintained by a membrane process intrinsic to each cell. we now extend this model by incorporating recurrent connections with modifiable synapses to store long-term memory (ltm). the repetition provided by stm gradually modifies synapses in a physiologically realistic way. because different memories are active in different gamma subcycles, the formation of autoassociative ltm requires that synaptic modification depend on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) channels having a time constant of deactivation that is of the same order as the duration of a gamma subcycle (15-50 msec). many types of nmda channels have longer time constants (150 msec), as for instance those found in the hippocampus, but both fast and slow nmda channels are present in cortex. this is the first proposal for the special role of these fast nmda channels. the stm for novel items must depend on activity-dependent changes intrinsic to neurons rather than recurrent connections, which have not developed the required selectivity. because these intrinsic mechanisms are not error-correcting, stm will become slowly corrupted by noise. this limits the accuracy with which ltm can become encoded after a single presentation. accurate encoding of items in ltm can be achieved by multiple presentations, provided different memory items are presented in a varied interleaved order. our results indicate that a limited memory-capacity stm model can be integrated in the same network with a high-capacity ltm model.
transgenic expression of lactoferrin imparts enhanced resistance to head blight of wheat caused by fusarium graminearum the ascomycete fungal pathogen fusarium graminearum (sexual stage: gibberella zeae) causes the devastating head blight or scab disease on wheat and barley, and cob or ear rot disease on maize. fusarium graminearum infection causes significant crop and quality losses. in addition to roles as virulence factors during pathogenesis, trichothecene mycotoxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol) produced by this pathogen constitute a significant threat to human and animal health if consumed in respective food or feed products. in the last few years, significant progress has been made towards a better understanding of the processes involved in f. graminearum pathogenesis, toxin biosynthesis and host resistance mechanisms through the use of high-throughput genomic and phenomic technologies. in this article, we briefly review these new advances and also discuss how future research can contribute to the development of sustainable plant protection strategies against this important plant pathogen.
regulatory snapshots: integrative mining of regulatory modules from expression time series and regulatory networks in this paper, we present google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. google is designed to crawl and index the web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. the prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/. to engineer a search engine is a challenging task. search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. they answer tens of millions of queries every day. despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. this paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. this paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.
preparation of biochar from enteromorpha prolifera and its use for the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) from aqueous solution. activated carbon was prepared from enteromorpha prolifera (ep) by zinc chloride activation. the physico-chemical properties of ep-activated carbon (epac) were characterized by thermal stability, zeta potential and boehm titration methods. the examination showed that epac has a porous structure with a high surface area of 1688 m(2)/g. batch adsorption experiments were carried out to study the effect of various parameters such as initial ph, adsorbent dosage, contact time and temperature on pb(ii) ions adsorption properties by epac. the kinetic studies showed that the adsorption data followed a pseudo second-order kinetic model. the isotherm analysis indicated that the adsorption data can be represented by freundlich isotherm model. thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption reaction was a spontaneous and endothermic process.
eddy amplitudes in baroclinic turbulence driven by nonzonal mean flow: shear dispersion of potential vorticity abstract the effect of small-scale forcing on large-scale structures in β-plane two-dimensional (2d) turbulence is studied using long-term direct numerical simulations (dns). we find that nonlinear effects remain strong at all times and for all scales and establish an inverse energy cascade that extends to the largest scales available in the system. the large-scale flow develops strong spectral anisotropy: k − 5 3 kolmogorov scaling holds for almost all φ, φ = arctan ( k y k x ) except in the small vicinity of kx = 0, where rhines's k−5 scaling prevails. due to the k−5 scaling, the spectral evolution of β-plane turbulence becomes extremely slow which, perhaps, explains why this scaling law has never before been observed in dns. simulations with different values of β indicate that the β-effect diminishes at small scales where the flow is nearly isotropic. thus, for simulations of β-plane turbulence forced at small scales sufficiently removed from the scales where β-effect is strong, large eddy simulation (les) can be used. a subgrid scale (sgs) parameterization for such les must account for the small-scale forcing that is not explicitly resolved and correctly accommodate two inviscid conservation laws, viz. energy and enstrophy. this requirement gives rise to a new anisotropic stabilized negative viscosity (snv) sgs representation which is discussed in the context of les of isotropic 2d turbulence.
muscle strength and electromyogram in boys and girls followed through puberty summarya new computerized dynamometer (the spark system) is described. the system can measure concentric and eccentric muscle strength (torque) during linear or nonlinear acceleration or deceleration, isokinetic movements up to 400° · s−1, and isometric torque. studies were performed to assess: i. validity and reproducibility of torque measurements; ii. control of lever arm position; iii. control of different velocity patterns; iv. control of velocity during subject testing; and, v. intra-individual reproducibility. no significant difference was found between torque values computed by the system and known torque values (p>0.05). no difference was present between programmed and external measurement of the lever arm position. accelerating, decelerating and isokinetic velocity patterns were highly reproducible, with differences in elapsed time among 10 trials being never greater than 0.001 s. velocity during concentric and eccentric isokinetic quadriceps contractions at 30° · s−1, 120° · s−1 and 270° · s−1 never varied by more than 3° · s−1 among subjects (n=21). over three days of testing, the overall error for concentric and eccentric quadriceps contraction peak torque values for 5 angular velocities between 30° · s−1 and 270° · s−1 ranged from 5.8% to 9.0% and 5.8% to 9.6% respectively (n=25). the results indicate that the spark system provides valid and reproducible torque measurements and strict control of velocity. in addition, the intra-individual error is in accordance with those reported for other similar devices.
crucial role of the residue r280 at the f′–g′ loop of the human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor α chain for ligand recognition granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) or interleukin-3 (il-3) suppress apoptosis in hemopoietic cells, a process of active cell death characterized by the degradation of genomic dna into oligonucleosomic fragments. the present study was therefore initiated with the view that the two growth factors may trigger the same early events in the cell, leading to suppression of apoptosis. we provide evidence here for a role of protein kinase c and of the na+/h+ antiporter in the signal transduction pathways activated by binding of gm-csf or il-3 to their respective receptors, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells. first, kinetic studies indicate that the process is irreversible after two hours of deprivation. the suppression of apoptosis by gm-csf and il-3 is dose-dependent, with half-efficient concentrations that are in the range of the dissociation constants of the high affinity gm-csf or il-3 receptor, respectively. second, the use of three inhibitors of protein kinase c (pkc), h7, staurosporine, and sphingosine, in concentrations that are below their toxicity limits, revert the suppression of apoptosis by il-3 and gm-csf. conversely, the use of 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa), a pkc activator, allows a bypass of receptor activation in suppression of apoptosis. western blotting of cytosolic and membrane proteins indicate that exposure of the cells to gm-csf, il-3, or tpa results in translocation of pkc to the cell membrane. our data, therefore, indicate that the activation of pkc is important in suppression of apoptosis by gm-csf and il-3. third, the two amiloride derivatives 5-(n,n-hexamethylene) and 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl)amiloride that specifically block the function of the na+/h+ antiport also revert the protective effect of gm-csf, il-3, and tpa on mo7-e cells. further, exposure of the cells to gm-csf, il-3, or tpa results in sustained phi alkalinizatio, which is abrogated when the cells are preincubated with 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl)amiloride, a specific inhibitor of the antiport. preincubation of the cells with staurosporine, a pkc inhibitor, also significantly reduces the effect of gm-csf or il-3 on phi. taken together, our data indicate that a functional antiport is required in suppression of apoptosis by gm-csf, il-3, or tpa. furthermore, our results are consistent with the view that gm-csf or il-3 receptor activation initiates the sequential activation of pkc and of the na+/h+ antiporter, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells.
mitochondrial creatine kinase activity and phosphate shuttling are acutely regulated by exercise in human skeletal muscle fat/cd36 (fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation 36), a plasma membrane fatty-acid transport protein, has been found on mitochondrial membranes; however, it remains unclear where fat/cd36 resides on this organelle or its functional role within mitochondria. in the present study, we demonstrate, using several different approaches, that in skeletal muscle fat/cd36 resides on the omm (outer mitochondrial membrane). to determine the functional role of mitochondrial fat/cd36 in this tissue, we determined oxygen consumption rates in permeabilized muscle fibres in wt (wild-type) and fat/cd36-ko (knockout) mice using a variety of substrates. despite comparable muscle mitochondrial content, as assessed by unaltered mtdna (mitochondrial dna), citrate synthase, β-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase complex iv and respiratory capacities [maximal oxphos (oxidative phosphorylation) respiration] in wt and ko mice, palmitate-supported respiration was 34% lower in ko animals. in contrast, palmitoyl-coa-supported respiration was unchanged. these results indicate that fat/cd36 is key for palmitate-supported respiration. therefore we propose a working model of mitochondrial fatty-acid transport, in which fat/cd36 is positioned on the omm, upstream of long-chain acyl-coa synthetase, thereby contributing to the regulation of mitochondrial fatty-acid transport. we further support this model by providing evidence that fat/cd36 is not located in mitochondrial contact sites, and therefore does not directly interact with carnitine palmitoyltransferase-i as original proposed.
design of lead peptide drugs from mushroom targeting cysteine proteases the iterative threading assembly refinement (i-tasser) server is an integrated platform for automated protein structure and function prediction based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm. starting from an amino acid sequence, i-tasser first generates three-dimensional (3d) atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations. the function of the protein is then inferred by structurally matching the 3d models with other known proteins. the output from a typical server run contains full-length secondary and tertiary structure predictions, and functional annotations on ligand-binding sites, enzyme commission numbers and gene ontology terms. an estimate of accuracy of the predictions is provided based on the confidence score of the modeling. this protocol provides new insights and guidelines for designing of online server systems for the state-of-the-art protein structure and function predictions. the server is available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/i-tasser.
outcome of microdissection tese compared with conventional tese in non‐obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
reducing monitoring overhead by integrating event- and time-triggered techniques we describe llvm (low level virtual machine), a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelong program analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and in idle time between runs. llvm defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (ssa) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in c) uniformly and efficiently. the llvm compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. to our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. we describe the design of the llvm representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits llvm provides for several challenging compiler problems.
endocrine disrupting chemicals in urine of japanese male partners of subfertile couples: a pilot study on exposure and semen quality. abstractthis paper describes a method for measuring cis- and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acids (cis-dcca and trans-dcca), cis-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (dbca), 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3pba), and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid (4f3pba) in human urine. these compounds are considered to be reliable biomarkers of exposure for many pyrethroid insecticides used in the united states. in this method, stable isotopically labeled analogues of trans-dcca and 3pba were spiked into urine as internal standards. after solid-phase extraction, the extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry using turbo ion-spray atmospheric pressure ionization. the limits of detection (lods) ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 μg/l. within-day relative standard deviations ranged from 1.8 to 13% and between-day relative standard deviations ranged from 0.5 to 18%. absolute analyte recoveries ranged from 72 to 93%. chromatographic retention times were less than 8 min. this method was used to measure urinary concentrations of these metabolites in persons with no known exposure to pyrethroids and some with suspected residential exposure. metabolites of synthetic pyrethroids were detected in 74% of the samples analyzed. cis-dcca, trans-dcca, dbca, 4f3pba, and 3pba were detected in 36, 50, 3, 9, and 64% of the samples analyzed, respectively.
cyclosporine a in ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy: long-term results we have assessed the reliability of hand‐held myometry in 33 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (sma), testing elbow flexion, handgrip, three‐point pinch, knee flexion, knee extension, and foot dorsiflexion, and determining intraclass correlation coefficients (icc). interrater reliability was high for upper limbs, with an icc of 0.92 for three‐point pinch and 0.98 for elbow flexion and grip. for lower limbs interrater reliability was good with icc >0.85 for all measures except foot dorsiflexion. test–retest results were excellent with icc >0.91 in all instances. hand‐held myometry is easily performed in sma patients of various ages and muscle strengths, is a reliable measure of limb muscle strength, and can be used in longitudinal studies and clinical trials. © 2002 wiley periodicals, inc. muscle nerve 26: 64–70, 2002
exogenous introduction of an immunodominant peptide from the non-structural ie1 protein of human cytomegalovirus into the mhc class i presentation pathway by recombinant dense bodies. immune control of human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection can be mediated by cd8+ cytolytic t lymphocytes (ctl). adoptive transfer of antiviral ctl confers protection against hcmv reactivation and disease. the tegument protein pp65 and the immediate-early 1 protein (ie1) are recognized to be major ctl targets, even though during productive infection the viral immunoevasion proteins gpus2-11 act to suppress major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i-restricted antigen presentation. thus it was not clear how infected cells could be labelled with antigenic peptides in the face of immunoevasion. we show here that the immunodominant peptide pp65nlv was presented by mhc class i in cells infected with a gpus2-11-competent virus. presentation of pp65nlv was still detectable at 96 h post-infection, although at low levels. partial suppression of pp65nlv presentation was dependent on the ability of the infecting strain to express gpus2-11. mhc class i-restricted antigen presentation in hcmv-infected cells (encoding gpus2-11) exhibited specificity for pp65-derived peptides, as infected fibroblasts did not present the ie1-derived nonapeptide ie1tmy. remarkably, infected cells could restore pp65nlv peptide presentation after acid removal of mhc class i despite gpus2-11 expression. this recovery was shown to be dependent on proteasome functionality. in contrast to ie1, pp65 peptides are loaded on mhc class i molecules to be transported to the cell surface at early and late times after infection in the face of gpus2-11-mediated immunoevasion. pp65 is therefore the first example of an hcmv protein only incompletely subjected to gpus2-11-mediated immunoevasion.
child weight growth trajectory and its determinants in a sample of iranian children from birth until 2 years of age abstract over the last decade the use of generalized linear models (glms) in actuarial statistics has received a lot of attention, starting from the actuarial illustrations in the standard text by mccullagh and nelder [mccullagh, p., nelder, j.a., 1989. generalized linear models. in: monographs on statistics and applied probability. chapman and hall, new york]. traditional glms however model a sample of independent random variables. since actuaries very often have repeated measurements or longitudinal data (i.e. repeated measurements over time) at their disposal, this article considers statistical techniques for modelling such data within the framework of glms. use is made of generalized linear mixed models (glmms) which model a transformation of the mean as a linear function of both fixed and random effects. the likelihood and bayesian approaches to glmms are explained. the models are illustrated by considering classical credibility models and more general regression models for non-life ratemaking in the context of glmms. details on computation and implementation (in sas and winbugs ) are provided.
clarifying variability of corticomotoneuronal function in kennedy disease supramaximal percutaneous electrical stimuli applied over the human cervical vertebral column produce maximal compound muscle action potentials (cmaps) in abductor digiti minimi. it is important to know which neural elements are excited by these stimuli and experiments were performed to answer this question. with stimulating electrodes placed progressively lateral to the midline, submaximal cmaps with the same latency are produced. with shocks over the cervical vertebrae in the midline, the threshold for excitation of arm muscles is much lower than for excitation of leg muscles. comparison of conduction time from the cervical column to more distal sites on the ulnar nerve by direct measurement and by f wave latency determination shows that the latter exceeds the former by 1.6 msec. collision experiments in which paired shocks were given at the wrist and erb's point or the wrist and cervical column showed that recovery from blocking as interstimulus interval lengthened was similar for the two sites, and that it was possible to detect f waves from the proximal stimulus. the latency of cmaps evoked from midline surface stimuli was identical to that from a needle stimulus near the c8 root. it is concluded that electrical stimuli applied over the cervical vertebrae in the midline excite the motor roots at their exit from the spinal canal. this finding has implications for clinical studies of pyramidal tract and proximal peripheral nerve conduction.
genetic diversity and population structure of the pelagic thresher shark (alopias pelagicus) in the pacific ocean: evidence for two evolutionarily significant units the identification of genetically homogeneous groups of individuals is a long standing issue in population genetics. a recent bayesian algorithm implemented in the software structure allows the identification of such groups. however, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (k) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. the goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual‐based model. we found that in most cases the estimated ‘log probability of data’ does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, k. however, using an ad hoc statistic δk based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive k values, we found that structure accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. as might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (aflp vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.
il-21 r gene polymorphisms and serum il-21 levels predict virological response to interferon-based therapy in asian chronic hepatitis c patients objectives: early hepatitis c viral (hcv) kinetics following pegylated interferon-α (peg-ifn) and ribavirin help to assess treatment in the western world. whether this functions in taiwanese patients remains unknown. studying the early hcv kinetics in taiwanese patients may clarify this issue. methods: six chronic hepatitis c patients were enrolled. a peg-ifn-α dose was administered at week 1, then it was administered weekly with daily ribavirin for 24 weeks. serum hcv rna levels were determined frequently during the trial and qualitatively at week 49. kinetic parameters ε (effectiveness at inhibiting viral production)and δ (loss rate of infected cells) were estimated from viral loads and alanine aminotransferase (alt) kinetics, respectively. results: all serum hcv rna levels became undetectable at week 12. the ε ranged from 0.4128 to 0.9904 and δ from 0.0019 to 0.1245. the log values of viral load differences between day 7 and 14 ranged from 0.15 to 1.21. only 1 patient had an abnormal alt level at week 49. conclusions: viral kinetic parameters in taiwanese patients were similar to those in western studies. however, the early viral decline pattern and viral negativity rate in taiwanese patients might be different from caucasian patients. further large-scale studies to clarify this issue are ongoing.
improving active mealy machine learning for protocol conformance testing cadp (construction and analysis of distributed processes) is a comprehensive software toolbox that implements the results of concurrency theory. started in the mid 80s, cadp has been continuously developed by adding new tools and enhancing existing ones. today, cadp benefits from a worldwide user community, both in academia and industry. this paper presents the latest release cadp 2010, which is the result of a considerable development effort spanning the last four years. the paper first describes the theoretical principles and the modular architecture of cadp, which has inspired several other recent model checkers. the paper then reviews the main features of cadp 2010, including compilers for various formal specification languages, equivalence checkers, model checkers, performance evaluation tools, and parallel verification tools running on clusters and grids.
managing common mental health problems: contrasting views of primary care physicians and psychiatrists. objective the authors sought to determine whether integrated mental health services or enhanced referral to specialty mental health clinics results in greater engagement in mental health/substance abuse services by older primary care patients.   method this multisite randomized trial included 10 sites consisting of primary care and specialty mental health/substance abuse clinics. primary care patients 65 years old or older (n=24,930) were screened. the final study group consisted of 2,022 patients (mean age=73.5 years; 26% female; 48% ethnic minority) with depression (n=1,390), anxiety (n=70), at-risk alcohol use (n=414), or dual diagnosis (n=148) who were randomly assigned to integrated care (mental health and substance abuse providers co-located in primary care; n=999) or enhanced referral to specialty mental health/substance abuse clinics (i.e., facilitated scheduling, transportation, payment; n=1,023).   results seventy-one percent of patients engaged in treatment in the integrated model compared with 49% in the enhanced referral model. integrated care was associated with more mental health and substance abuse visits per patient (mean=3.04) relative to enhanced referral (mean=1.91). overall, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and higher mental distress. for depression, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and more severe depression. for at-risk alcohol users, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and more severe problem drinking. for all conditions, greater engagement was associated with closer proximity of mental health/substance abuse services to primary care.   conclusions older primary care patients are more likely to accept collaborative mental health treatment within primary care than in mental health/substance abuse clinics. these results suggest that integrated service arrangements improve access to mental health and substance abuse services for older adults who underuse these services.
relatively-paired space analysis: learning a latent common space from relatively-paired observations we present a general method using kernel canonical correlation analysis to learn a semantic representation to web images and their associated text. the semantic space provides a common representation and enables a comparison between the text and images. in the experiments, we look at two approaches of retrieving images based on only their content from a text query. we compare orthogonalization approaches against a standard cross-representation retrieval technique known as the generalized vector space model.
reduction in primary production followed by rapid recovery of plant biomass in response to repeated mid-season droughts in a semiarid shrubland pseudoreplication is controversial across experimental biology. researchers in the same field can disagree on whether a given study suffers from pseudoreplication and on to what extent any pseudoreplication undermines the value of a study. a recent survey indicated that concerns about pseudoreplication can strongly impact peer review of manuscripts submitted for publication. here we explore controversies around pseudoreplication, identify issues requiring resolution, and in each case offer a resolution. we emphasise that having non-independence in data points and pseudoreplicating are not the same thing. researchers should be able to demonstrate that in a given experiment they have minimised and controlled the risk of non-independence weakening their study. if they do that to the satisfaction of others, they have avoided pseudoreplication.
intrusion detection systems with live knowledge system this paper introduces a new method for the rapid development of complex rule bases involving cue phrases for the purpose of classifying text segments. the method is based on ripple-down rules, a knowledge acquisition method that proved very successful in practice for building medical expert systems and does not require a knowledge engineer. we implemented our system kaftan and demonstrate the applicability of our method to the task of classifying scientific citations. building cue phrase rules in kaftan is easy and efficient. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting experimental results where our resulting classifier clearly outperforms previously built classifiers in the recent literature.
slice profile and b1 corrections in 2d magnetic resonance fingerprinting purpose to develop a magnetic resonance (mr) "fingerprinting" technique for quantitative abdominal imaging.   materials and methods this hipaa-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. to achieve accurate quantification in the presence of marked b0 and b1 field inhomogeneities, the mr fingerprinting framework was extended by using a two-dimensional fast imaging with steady-state free precession, or fisp, acquisition and a bloch-siegert b1 mapping method. the accuracy of the proposed technique was validated by using agarose phantoms. quantitative measurements were performed in eight asymptomatic subjects and in six patients with 20 focal liver lesions. a two-tailed student t test was used to compare the t1 and t2 results in metastatic adenocarcinoma with those in surrounding liver parenchyma and healthy subjects.   results phantom experiments showed good agreement with standard methods in t1 and t2 after b1 correction. in vivo studies demonstrated that quantitative t1, t2, and b1 maps can be acquired within a breath hold of approximately 19 seconds. t1 and t2 measurements were compatible with those in the literature. representative values included the following: liver, 745 msec ± 65 (standard deviation) and 31 msec ± 6; renal medulla, 1702 msec ± 205 and 60 msec ± 21; renal cortex, 1314 msec ± 77 and 47 msec ± 10; spleen, 1232 msec ± 92 and 60 msec ± 19; skeletal muscle, 1100 msec ± 59 and 44 msec ± 9; and fat, 253 msec ± 42 and 77 msec ± 16, respectively. t1 and t2 in metastatic adenocarcinoma were 1673 msec ± 331 and 43 msec ± 13, respectively, significantly different from surrounding liver parenchyma relaxation times of 840 msec ± 113 and 28 msec ± 3 (p < .0001 and p < .01) and those in hepatic parenchyma in healthy volunteers (745 msec ± 65 and 31 msec ± 6, p < .0001 and p = .021, respectively).   conclusion a rapid technique for quantitative abdominal imaging was developed that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue properties within one 19-second breath hold, with measurements comparable to those in published literature.
better parameter-free anytime search by minimizing time between solutions current heuristic estimators for classical domain-independent planning are usually based on one of four ideas: delete relaxations, critical paths, abstractions, and, most recently, landmarks. previously, these different ideas for deriving heuristic functions were largely unconnected.    we prove that admissible heuristics based on these ideas are in fact very closely related. exploiting this relationship, we introduce a new admissible heuristic called the landmark cut heuristic, which compares favourably with the state of the art in terms of heuristic accuracy and overall performance.
probability type inference for flexible approximate programming energy is increasingly a first-order concern in computer systems. exploiting energy-accuracy trade-offs is an attractive choice in applications that can tolerate inaccuracies. recent work has explored exposing this trade-off in programming models. a key challenge, though, is how to isolate parts of the program that must be precise from those that can be approximated so that a program functions correctly even as quality of service degrades.  we propose using type qualifiers to declare data that may be subject to approximate computation. using these types, the system automatically maps approximate variables to low-power storage, uses low-power operations, and even applies more energy-efficient algorithms provided by the programmer. in addition, the system can statically guarantee isolation of the precise program component from the approximate component. this allows a programmer to control explicitly how information flows from approximate data to precise data. importantly, employing static analysis eliminates the need for dynamic checks, further improving energy savings. as a proof of concept, we develop enerj, an extension to java that adds approximate data types. we also propose a hardware architecture that offers explicit approximate storage and computation. we port several applications to enerj and show that our extensions are expressive and effective; a small number of annotations lead to significant potential energy savings (10%-50%) at very little accuracy cost.
gambit: a parameterless model-based evolutionary algorithm for mixed-integer problems evolution strategies (ess) are powerful probabilistic search and optimization algorithms gleaned from biological evolution theory. they have been successfully applied to a wide range of real world applications. the modern ess are mainly designed for solving continuous parameter optimization problems. their ability to adapt the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution used for mutation during the optimization run makes them well suited for this domain. in this article we describe and study mixed integer evolution strategies (mies), which are natural extensions of es for mixed integer optimization problems. mies can deal with parameter vectors consisting not only of continuous variables but also with nominal discrete and integer variables. following the design principles of the canonical evolution strategies, they use specialized mutation operators tailored for the aforementioned mixed parameter classes. for each type of variable, the choice of mutation operators is governed by a natural metric for this variable type, maximal entropy, and symmetry considerations. all distributions used for mutation can be controlled in their shape by means of scaling parameters, allowing self-adaptation to be implemented. after introducing and motivating the conceptual design of the mies, we study the optimality of the self-adaptation of step sizes and mutation rates on a generalized (weighted) sphere model. moreover, we prove global convergence of the mies on a very general class of problems. the remainder of the article is devoted to performance studies on artificial landscapes (barrier functions and mixed integer nk landscapes), and a case study in the optimization of medical image analysis systems. in addition, we show that with proper constraint handling techniques, mies can also be applied to classical mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
person re-identification in crowd viewpoint invariant pedestrian recognition is an important yet under-addressed problem in computer vision. this is likely due to the difficulty in matching two objects with unknown viewpoint and pose. this paper presents a method of performing viewpoint invariant pedestrian recognition using an efficiently and intelligently designed object representation, the ensemble of localized features (elf). instead of designing a specific feature by hand to solve the problem, we define a feature space using our intuition about the problem and let a machine learning algorithm find the best representation. we show how both an object class specific representation and a discriminative recognition model can be learned using the adaboost algorithm. this approach allows many different kinds of simple features to be combined into a single similarity function. the method is evaluated using a viewpoint invariant pedestrian recognition dataset and the results are shown to be superior to all previous benchmarks for both recognition and reacquisition of pedestrians.
habitat and host indicate lineage identity in colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. from wild and agricultural landscapes in north america unlabelled raxml-vi-hpc (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood for high performance computing) is a sequential and parallel program for inference of large phylogenies with maximum likelihood (ml). low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the gtr+cat approximation as replacement for gtr+gamma yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of raxml. a large-scale performance comparison with garli, phyml, iqpnni and mrbayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that raxml requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (garli) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. on datasets > or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than garli. raxml has been parallelized with mpi to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. the program has been used to compute ml trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively.   availability icwww.epfl.ch/~stamatak
adaptive and scalable load balancing scheme for sort-last parallel volume rendering on gpu clusters hardware-accelerated image composition for sort-last parallel rendering has received increasing attention as an effective solution to increased performance demands brought about by the recent advances in commodity graphics accelerators. so far, several different hardware solutions for alpha and depth compositing have been proposed and a few of them have become commercially available. they share impressive compositing speed and high scalability. however, the cost makes it prohibitively expensive to build a large visualization system. in this paper, we used a hardware image compositor marketed by mitsubishi precision co., ltd. (mpc) which is now available as an independent device enabling the building of our own visualization cluster. this device is based on binary compositing tree architecture, and the scalable cascade interconnection makes it possible to build a large visualization system. however, we focused on a minimal configuration pc cluster using only one compositing device while taking cost into consideration. in order to emulate this cascade interconnection of mpc compositors, we propose and evaluate the hybrid hardware-assisted image composition method which uses the opengl alpha blending capability of the graphics boards for assisting the hardware image composition process. preliminary experiments show that the use of graphics boards diminished the performance degradation when using an emulation based on image feedback through available interconnection network. we found that this proposed method becomes an important alternative for providing high performance image composition at a reasonable cost.
factors influencing paternity in multiply mated female red-sided garter snakes and the persistent use of sperm stored over winter sexual conflict over mating can result in sex-specific morphologies and behaviours that allow each sex to exert control over the outcome of reproduction. genital traits, in particular, are often directly involved in conflict interactions. via genital manipulation, we experimentally investigated whether genital traits in red-sided garter snakes influence copulation duration and formation of a copulatory plug. the hemipenes of male red-sided garter snakes have a large basal spine that inserts into the female cloaca during mating. we ablated the spine and found that males were still capable of copulation but copulation duration was much shorter and copulatory plugs were smaller than those produced by intact males. we also anaesthetized the female cloacal region and found that anaesthetized females copulated longer than control females, suggesting that female cloacal and vaginal contractions play a role in controlling copulation duration. both results, combined with known aspects of the breeding biology of red-sided garter snakes, strongly support the idea that sexual conflict is involved in mating interactions in this species. our results demonstrate the complex interactions among male and female traits generated by coevolutionary processes in a wild population. such complexity highlights the importance of simultaneous examination of male and female traits.
mitochondrial liver toxicity of valproic acid and its acid derivatives is related to inhibition of α-lipoamide dehydrogenase the effect of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (vpa) on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) was investigated in vitro. two experimental approaches were used, in the presence of selected respiratory-chain substrates: (1) formation of atp in digitonin permeabilized rat hepatocytes and (2) measurement of the rate of oxygen consumption by polarography in rat liver mitochondria. vpa (0.1-1.0 mm) was found to inhibit oxygen consumption and atp synthesis under state 3 conditions with glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate as respiratory substrates. no inhibitory effect on oxphos was observed when succinate (plus rotenone) was used as substrate. we tested the hypothesis that dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (dldh) might be a direct target of vpa, especially its acyl-coa intermediates. valproyl-coa (0.5-1.0 mm) and valproyl-dephosphocoa (0.5-1.0 mm) both inhibited the dldh activity, acting apparently by different mechanisms. the decreased activity of dldh induced by vpa metabolites may, at least in part, account for the impaired rate of oxygen consumption and atp synthesis in mitochondria if 2-oxoglutarate or glutamate were used as respiratory substrates, thus limiting the flux of these substrates through the citric acid cycle.
an extension of lazy abstraction with interpolation for programs with arrays we present a tool for the formal verification of ansi-c programs using bounded model checking (bmc). the emphasis is on usability: the tool supports almost all ansi-c language features, including pointer constructs, dynamic memory allocation, recursion, and the float and double data types. from the perspective of the user, the verification is highly automated: the only input required is the bmc bound. the tool is integrated into a graphical user interface. this is essential for presenting long counterexample traces: the tool allows stepping through the trace in the same way a debugger allows stepping through a program.
hierarchical graph representation learning with differentiable pooling we present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs. we motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. in a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.
substrate utilization during endurance exercise in men and women after endurance training. the female sex hormone 17beta-estradiol (e(2)) has been shown to increase lipid and decrease carbohydrate utilization in animals. we administrated oral e(2) and placebo (randomized, double blind, crossover) to eight human male subjects for 8 days ( approximately 3 mg/day) and measured respiratory variables, plasma substrates, hormones (e(2), testosterone, leptin, cortisol, insulin, and catecholamines), and substrate utilization during 90 min of endurance exercise. [6,6-(2)h]glucose and [1,1,2,3,3-(2)h]glycerol tracers were used to calculate substrate flux. e(2) administration increased serum e(2) (0.22 to 2.44 nmol/l, p < 0.05) and decreased serum testosterone (19.4 to 11.5 nmol/l, p < 0.05) concentrations, yet there were no treatment effects on any of the other hormones. glucose rates of appearance (r(a)) and disappearance (r(d)) were lower, and glycerol r(a)-to-r(d) ratio was not affected by e(2) administration. o(2) uptake, co(2) production, and respiratory exchange ratio were not affected by e(2); however, there was a decrease in heart rate (p < 0.05). plasma lactate and glycerol were unaffected by e(2); however, glucose was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) during exercise after e(2) administration. we concluded that short-term oral e(2) administration decreased glucose r(a) and r(d), maintained plasma glucose homeostasis, but had no effect on substrate oxidation during exercise in men.
rising social inequalities in us childhood obesity, 2003-2007. this study examines state- and regional disparities in obesity prevalence among 46,707 us children and adolescents aged 10–17 years before and after adjusting for individual socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics and area deprivation measures. the 2003 national survey of children’s health was used to calculate obesity prevalence in nine geographic regions and in the 50 states and the district of columbia (dc). logistic regression was used to estimate odds of obesity and adjusted prevalence. ols regression was used to determine the amount of variance explained by income inequality, poverty, and violent crime rates. the prevalence of childhood obesity varied substantially across geographic areas, with the southcentral regions of the us having the highest prevalence (≥18%) and the mountain region the lowest prevalence (11.4%). children in west virginia, kentucky, texas, tennessee, and north carolina (adjusted prevalence >18.3%) had over twice the odds of being obese than their utah counterparts (adjusted prevalence = 10.4%). geographic disparities in obesity were similar for male and female children. individual characteristics such as race/ethnicity, household socioeconomic status, neighborhood social capital, television viewing, recreational computer use, and physical activity accounted for 55% of the state and 25% of the regional disparities in obesity. area poverty rates accounted for an additional 18% of the state variance in adjusted obesity prevalence. although individual and area level socioeconomic factors are important predictors, substantial geographic disparities in childhood and adolescent obesity remain. prevention efforts targeting individual risk factors as well as contextual social and environmental factors may reduce geographic disparities in childhood and adolescent obesity.
acute effects of static stretching on characteristics of the isokinetic angle – torque relationship, surface electromyography, and mechanomyography the purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of static stretching on peak torque (pt), the joint angle at pt, mean power output (mp), electromyographic (emg) amplitude, and mechanomyographic (mmg) amplitude of the vastus lateralis (vl) and rectus femoris (rf) muscles during maximal, voluntary concentric isokinetic leg extensions at 60 and 240°·s-1 of the stretched and unstretched limbs. twenty-one volunteers [mean age (sd) 21.5 (1.3) years] performed maximal, voluntary concentric isokinetic leg extensions for the dominant and non-dominant limbs at 60 and 240°·s-1. surface emg (μvrms) and mmg (mvrms) signals were recorded from the vl and rf muscles during the isokinetic tests. pt (nm), the joint angle at pt, and mp (w) were calculated by a dynamometer. following the initial isokinetic tests, the dominant leg extensors were stretched using four static stretching exercises. after the stretching, the isokinetic tests were repeated. pt decreased (p≤0.05) from pre- to post-stretching for the stretched limb at 60 and 240°·s-1 and for the unstretched limb at 60°·s-1. emg amplitude of the vl and rf also decreased (p≤0.05) from pre- to post-stretching for the stretched and unstretched limbs. there were no stretching-induced changes (p>0.05) for the joint angle at pt, mp, or mmg amplitude. these findings indicated stretching-induced decreases in force production and muscle activation. the decreases in pt and emg amplitude for the unstretched limb suggested that the stretching-induced decreases may be due to a central nervous system inhibitory mechanism.
development of genetic markers in the non-structural protein 2 region of a us type 1 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus: implications for future recombinant marker vaccine development. recently, isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) that possess nucleotide sequences similar to european isolates have been reported in united states herds. the origin, diversity and prevalence of european-like north american prrsv isolates in the u.s. remain unknown. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 12kb orf1 of a north american isolate, sdprrs 01-08 (01-08), showed 93.7% identity with lelystad virus (lv), the prototypic european isolate, but only 58% identity with vr-2332, the prototypic north american isolate. comparisons between lv and 01-08 at the peptide sequence level of the predicted non-structural proteins (nsp) showed that nsp9 (98.9% amino acid identity) was the most conserved and the least conserved was nsp2 at 90.6% identity. for the purpose of comparison, gp5, the principal envelope structural protein, showed a 93.5% identity between 01-08 and lv. the most dramatic differences between the nsp2 proteins of lv and 01-08 were a single 17 amino acid deletion between residues 734 and 750, as well as several amino acid differences. the same deletion was identified in the nsp2 in five of seven other europrrsv isolates submitted to the south dakota animal disease research and diagnostic laboratory. the remaining two isolates contained small deletions, but in other regions of nsp2. peptide sequence diversity in the form of hypervariability and deletions in nsp2 demonstrate that european-like prrsv isolates in the usa represent a heterogeneous group. furthermore, areas in nsp2 with deletions and amino acid hypervariability localize to regions that are predicted to be immunologically important.
a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (wb-pbpk) model of ciprofloxacin: a step towards predicting bacterial killing at sites of infection purposethe aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the nonmem prior functionality compared to a full bayesian method when applied to population physiological models using diazepam as a case study.methodswhole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (wbpbpk) models for diazepam were initially developed, tested and calibrated for rats and man using a full bayesian analysis as implemented in winbugs. the final models were implemented in nonmem and the results from the two analyses compared in terms of parameter estimates, measures of parameter precision and run times.resultsnonmem population parameter estimates were in close agreement with those produced by the bayesian analysis although there was a substantial shortening of run time for both the animal wbpbpk model (4.5 vs. 21 h) and human wbpbpk models (2 vs. 167 h). the adequacy of the model and the final parameter estimates were judged to be sufficient by the model’s ability to describe individual tissue concentration-time profiles. the model provided a good overall description of the plasma concentration-time data in both rat and man with comparable parameter precision. a limited nonparametric bootstrap (n = 50) was performed to assess parameter sensitivity, bias and imprecision. no systematic bias was seen when comparing bootstrap means to final parameter estimates.conclusionsthe ease of implementation and reductions in run time hopefully provide a further step forward in allowing the wider use of these complex and information-rich models together with clinical data in the future.
models for the prediction of ppars agonistic activity of indanylacetic acids backgroundrecent advances in high-throughput screening (hts) techniques and readily available compound libraries generated using combinatorial chemistry or derived from natural products enable the testing of millions of compounds in a matter of days. due to the amount of information produced by hts assays, it is a very challenging task to mine the hts data for potential interest in drug development research. computational approaches for the analysis of hts results face great challenges due to the large quantity of information and significant amounts of erroneous data produced.resultsin this study, decision trees (dt) based models were developed to discriminate compound bioactivities by using their chemical structure fingerprints provided in the pubchem system http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. the dt models were examined for filtering biological activity data contained in four assays deposited in the pubchem bioassay database including assays tested for 5ht1a agonists, antagonists, and hiv-1 rt-rnase h inhibitors. the 10-fold cross validation (cv) sensitivity, specificity and matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) for the models are 57.2~80.5%, 97.3~99.0%, 0.4~0.5 respectively. a further evaluation was also performed for dt models built for two independent bioassays, where inhibitors for the same hiv rnase target were screened using different compound libraries, this experiment yields enrichment factor of 4.4 and 9.7.conclusionour results suggest that the designed dt models can be used as a virtual screening technique as well as a complement to traditional approaches for hits selection.
otoferlin is critical for a highly sensitive and linear calcium-dependent exocytosis at vestibular hair cell ribbon synapses multiple ca2+ channels confer diverse functions to hair cells of the auditory and vestibular organs in the mammalian inner ear. we used gene-targeting technology to generate α1d ca2+ channel-deficient mice to determine the physiological role of these ca2+ channels in hearing and balance. analyses of auditory-evoked brainstem recordings confirmed that α1d−/− mice were deaf and revealed that heterozygous (α1d+/−) mice have increased hearing thresholds. however, hearing deficits in α1d+/− mice were manifested mainly by the increase in threshold of low-frequency sounds. in contrast to impaired hearing, α1d−/− mice have balance performances equivalent to their wild-type littermates. light and electron microscope analyses of the inner ear revealed outer hair cell loss at the apical cochlea, but no apparent abnormality at the basal cochlea and the vestibule. we determined the mechanisms underlying the auditory function defects and the normal vestibular functions by examining the ba2+ currents in cochlear inner and outer hair cells versus utricular hair cells in α1d+/− mice. whereas the whole-cell ba2+ currents in inner hair cells consist mainly of the nimodipine-sensitive current (~85%), the utricular hair cells express only ~50% of this channel subtype. thus, differential expression of α1d channels in the cochlear and utricular hair cells confers the phenotype of the α1d null mutant mice. because vestibular and cochlear hair cells share common features and null deletion of several genes have yielded both deafness and imbalance in mice, α1d null mutant mice may serve as a model to disentangle vestibular from auditory-specific functions.
efficient 2d and 3d facade segmentation using auto-context there is an increasing interest in semantically annotated 3d models, e.g. of cities. the typical approaches start with the semantic labelling of all the images used for the 3d model. such labelling tends to be very time consuming though. the inherent redundancy among the overlapping images calls for more efficient solutions. this paper proposes an alternative approach that exploits the geometry of a 3d mesh model obtained from multi-view reconstruction. instead of clustering similar views, we predict the best view before the actual labelling. for this we find the single image part that bests supports the correct semantic labelling of each face of the underlying 3d mesh. moreover, our single-image approach may surprise because it tends to increase the accuracy of the model labelling when compared to approaches that fuse the labels from multiple images. as a matter of fact, we even go a step further, and only explicitly label a subset of faces (e.g. 10%), to subsequently fill in the labels of the remaining faces. this leads to a further reduction of computation time, again combined with a gain in accuracy. compared to a process that starts from the semantic labelling of the images, our method to semantically label 3d models yields accelerations of about 2 orders of magnitude. we tested our multi-view semantic labelling on a variety of street scenes.
maternal protein restriction increases respiratory and sympathetic activities and sensitizes peripheral chemoreflex in male rat offspring. abstract total body plethysmography can be used to measure ventilation of hibernating mammals and poikilothenns where other methods are inapplicable as they involve handling the animals excessively. pressure in a closed chamber containing the animal is recorded as it changes with cyclic variations of temperature and vapor pressure of the inspired and expired gas. in the plethysmograph developed for use with hibemators and poikilothenns, the difference between ambient and body temperature must be small (3–4° c), and the apparatus has been specially designed to eliminate thermal drifts and vibrational noise. theoretical study of the method shows that simple equations based on isothermal transformations may be applied in physiological (adiabatic) conditions with certain restrictions. the sign of the pressure variation caused by inspiration is the same as that of the body-to-ambience temperature difference. ventilation of hibernating marmots and of turtles measured with this plethysmograph is briefly described.
alteration of selection regime resulting from harvest of american ginseng, panax quinquefolius recent theoretical work in quantitative genetics has fueled interest in measuring natural selection in the wild. we discuss statistical and biological issues that may arise in applications of lande and arnold's (1983) multiple‐regression approach to measuring selection. we review assumptions involved in estimation and hypothesis testing in regression problems, and we note difficulties that frequently arise as a result of violation of these assumptions. in particular, multicollinearity (extreme intercorrelation of characters) and extrinsic, unmeasured factors affecting fitness may seriously complicate inference regarding selection. further, violation of the assumption that residuals are normally distributed vitiates tests of significance. for this situation, we suggest applications of recently developed jackknife tests of significance. while fitness regression permits direct assessment of selection in a form suitable for predicting selection response, we suggest that the aim of inferring causal relationships about the effects of phenotypic characters on fitness is greatly facilitated by manipulative experiments. finally, we discuss alternative definitions of stabilizing and disruptive selection.
phospholemman overexpression inhibits na+-k+-atpase in adult rat cardiac myocytes: relevance to decreased na+ pump activity in postinfarction myocytes. overexpression of phospholemman (plm) in normal adult rat cardiac myocytes altered contractile function and cytosolic ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) homeostasis and inhibited na+/ca2+ exchanger (ncx1). in addition, plm coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with ncx1 in cardiac myocyte lysates. in this study, we evaluated whether the cytoplasmic domain of plm is crucial in mediating its effects on contractility, [ca2+]i transients, and ncx1 activity. canine plm or its derived mutants were overexpressed in adult rat myocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. confocal immunofluorescence images using canine-specific plm antibodies demonstrated that the exogenous plm or its mutants were correctly targeted to sarcolemma, t-tubules, and intercalated discs, with little to none detected in intracellular compartments. overexpression of canine plm or its mutants did not affect expression of ncx1, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase, na(+)-k(+)-atpase, and calsequestrin in adult rat myocytes. a cooh-terminal deletion mutant in which all four potential phosphorylation sites (ser62, ser63, ser68, and thr69) were deleted, a partial cooh-terminal deletion mutant in which ser68 and thr69 were deleted, and a mutant in which all four potential phosphorylation sites were changed to alanine all lost wild-type plm's ability to modulate cardiac myocyte contractility. these observations suggest the importance of ser68 or thr69 in mediating plm's effect on cardiac contractility. focusing on ser68, the ser68 to glu mutant was fully effective, the ser63 to ala (leaving ser68 intact) mutant was partially effective, and the ser68 to ala mutant was completely ineffective in modulating cardiac contractility, [ca2+]i transients, and ncx1 currents. both the ser63 to ala and ser68 to ala mutants, as well as plm, were able to coimmunoprecipitate ncx1. it is known that ser68 in plm is phosphorylated by both protein kinases a and c. we conclude that regulation of cardiac contractility, [ca2+]i transients, and ncx1 activity by plm is critically dependent on ser68. we suggest that plm phosphorylation at ser68 may be involved in camp- and/or protein kinase c-dependent regulation of cardiac contractility.
mutualism or parasitism? using a phylogenetic approach to characterize the oxpecker‐ungulate relationship phylogenetic trees describe the pattern of descent amongst a group of species. with the rapid accumulation of dna sequence data, more and more phylogenies are being constructed based upon sequence comparisons. the combination of these phylogenies with powerful new statistical approaches for the analysis of biological evolution is challenging widely held beliefs about the history and evolution of life on earth.
quadratic regularization with cubic descent for unconstrained optimization ∗ in this work we propose a class of quasi-newton methods to minimize a twice differentiable function with lipschitz continuous hessian. these methods are based on the quadratic regularization of newton’s method, with algebraic explicit rules for computing the regularizing parameter. the convergence properties of this class of methods are analysed. we show that if the sequence generated by the algorithm converges then its limit point is stationary. we also establish local quadratic convergence in a neighborhood of a stationary point with positive definite hessian. encouraging numerical experiments are presented.
electrostatic control of the overall shape of calmodulin: numerical calculations the protein data bank (pdb), at brookhaven national laboratory, is a database containing information on experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological macromolecules, with approximately 9000 entries. the pdb has a 27-year history of service to a global community of researchers, educators, and students in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. data are easily submitted via pdb's www-based tool autodep, in either pdb or mmcif format, and are most conveniently examined via pdb's www-based tool 3db browser. collaborative centers have been, and continue to be, established worldwide to assist in data deposition, archiving, and distribution.
partial‐volume effect on ischemic tissue‐fate delineation using quantitative perfusion and diffusion imaging on a rat stroke model pixel-by-pixel spatiotemporal progression of focal ischemia (permanent occlusion) in rats was investigated using quantitative perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging every 30 minutes for 3 hours. the normal left-hemisphere apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) was 0.76 ± 0.03 × 10−3 mm2/s and cbf was 0.7 ± 0.3 ml · g−1 · min−1 (mean ± sd, n = 5). the adc and cbf viability thresholds yielding the lesion volumes (lv) at 3 hours that best approximated the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (ttc) infarct volumes (200 ± 30 mm2) at 24 hours were 0.53 ± 0.02 × 10−3 mm2/s (30% ± 2% reduction) and 0.30 ± 0.09 ml · g−1 · min−1 (57% ±11% reduction), respectively. temporal evolution of the adc- and cbf-defined lv showed a significant “perfusion-diffusion mismatch” up to 2 hours (p < 0.05, n = 11), a potential therapeutic window. based on the viability thresholds, three pixel clusters were identified on the cbf-adc scatterplots: (1) a “normal” cluster with normal cbf and adc, (2) an “ischemic core” cluster with markedly reduced cbf and adc, and (3) a “mismatch” cluster with reduced cbf but slightly reduced adc. these clusters were color-coded and mapped onto the image and cbf-adc spaces. lesions grew peripheral and medial to the initial adc abnormality. in contrast to the cbf distribution, the adc distribution in the ischemic hemisphere was bimodal; the relatively time-invariant bimodal-adc minima were 0.57 ± 0.02 × 10−3 mm2/s (corresponding cbf 0.35 ± 0.04 ml · g−1 · min−1), surprisingly similar to the ttc-derived thresholds. together, these results illustrate an analysis approach to systemically track the pixel-by-pixel spatiotemporal progression of acute ischemic brain injury.
modulation of expression of rat mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate carrier in nrk-52e cells alters mitochondrial transport and accumulation of glutathione and susceptibility to chemically induced apoptosis selective permeabilization of plasma membranes with digitonin produced separation of cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments of proximal tubular (pt) and distal tubular (dt) cells from a rat kidney. subcellular distributions of several intracellular glutathione (gsh)-dependent enzymes were similar in the two cell types but specific activities were significantly higher in pt cells, indicating that dt cells, particularly in their mitochondrial fraction, have a diminished capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen species. to enable isolation of suspensions of mitochondria, renal cells were treated with digitonin followed by the bacterial protease nagarse and were filtered through polycarbonate membranes. activity distributions of enzymatic markers for subcellular fractions were quantitated and uptake of gsh was studied in suspensions of pt and dt cell mitochondria. while pt cell mitochondria catalyzed rapid uptake of gsh that was inhibited by malate, indicating involvement of dicarboxylate carriers, dt cell mitochondria exhibited limited capacity for gsh uptake that was not inhibited by substrates for the two dicarboxylate carriers. this report provides the first description of methodology for the preparation of mitochondria from renal cells derived from specific nephron cell types and shows that mitochondria from dt cells have a significantly lower capacity to use gsh for detoxification and regulation of redox status.
a parallel multikey quicksort algorithm for mining multiword units after presenting a novel o(n3) parsing algorithm for dependency grammar, we develop three contrasting ways to stochasticize it. we propose (a) a lexical affinity model where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words fluctuate randomly in their selectional preferences, and (c) a generative model where the speaker fleshes out each word's syntactic and conceptual structure without regard to the implications for the hearer. we also give preliminary empirical results from evaluating the three models' parsing performance on annotated wall street journal training text (derived from the penn treebank). in these results, the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equally well at assigning part-of-speech tags.
successful mucosal immunization of cotton rats in the presence of measles virus-specific antibodies depends on degree of attenuation of vaccine vector and virus dose. abstract we showed previously that a single intranasal vaccination of mice with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) expressing an influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha) protein provided complete protection from lethal challenge with influenza virus (a. roberts, e. kretzschmar, a. s. perkins, j. forman, r. price, l. buonocore, y. kawaoka, and j. k. rose, j. virol. 72:4704–4711, 1998). because some pathogenesis was associated with the vector itself, in the present study we generated new vsv vectors expressing ha which are completely attenuated for pathogenesis in the mouse model. the first vector has a truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the vsv g protein and expresses influenza virus ha (ct1-ha). this nonpathogenic vector provides complete protection from lethal influenza virus challenge after intranasal administration. a second vector with vsv g deleted and expressing ha (δg-ha) is also protective and nonpathogenic and has the advantage of not inducing neutralizing antibodies to the vector itself.
age-related changes in the bimanual advantage and in brain oscillatory activity during tapping movements suggest a decline in processing sensory reafference background:  the clinical and molecular effects of antiepileptic drugs (aeds) have been extensively investigated. much less is known about their effects on human electrophysiology.
meta-analysis of remote ischemic conditioning in patients with acute myocardial infarction lethal reperfusion injury is a paradoxical type of myocardial injury caused by the restoration of coronary blood flow after an ischemic episode. this review focuses on the mechanisms of the injury, on attempts to protect the heart against it, and on promising new approaches to cardioprotection during percutaneous coronary intervention.
deer herbivory affects the functional diversity of forest floor plants via changes in competition-mediated assembly rules plant functional traits are the features (morphological, physiological, phenological) that represent ecological strategies and determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and influence ecosystem properties. variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardised ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. this line of research has been among the most fruitful avenues for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes. it also has the potential both to build a predictive set of local, regional and global relationships between plants and environment and to quantify a wide range of natural and human-driven processes, including changes in biodiversity, the impacts of species invasions, alterations in biogeochemical processes and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. the importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardised protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily. updated and expanded from the widely used previous version, this handbook retains the focus on clearly presented, widely applicable, step-by-step recipes, with a minimum of text on theory, and not only includes updated methods for the traits previously covered, but also introduces many new protocols for further traits. this new handbook has a better balance between whole-plant traits, leaf traits, root and stem traits and regenerative traits, and puts particular emphasis on traits important for predicting species’ effects on key ecosystem properties. we hope this new handbook becomes a standard companion in local and global efforts to learn about the responses and impacts of different plant species with respect to environmental changes in the present, past and future.
runtime pointer disambiguation the polyhedral model for loop parallelization has proved to be an effective tool for advanced optimization and automatic parallelization of programs in higher-level languages. yet, to integrate such optimizations seamlessly into production compilers, they must be performed on the compiler's internal, low-level, intermediate representation (ir). with polly, we present an infrastructure for polyhedral optimizations on such an ir. we describe the detection of program parts amenable to a polyhedral optimization (so-called static control parts), their translation to a z-polyhedral representation, optimizations on this representation and the generation of optimized ir code. furthermore, we define an interface for connecting external optimizers and present a novel way of using the parallelism they introduce to generate simd and openmp code. to evaluate polly, we compile the polybench 2.0 benchmarks fully automatically with pluto as external optimizer and parallelizer. we can report on significant speedups.
network-based prediction and analysis of hiv dependency factors experimentally determined networks are susceptible to errors, yet important inferences can still be drawn from them. many real networks have also been shown to have the small-world network properties of cohesive neighborhoods and short average distances between vertices. although much analysis has been done on small-world networks, small-world properties have not previously been used to improve our understanding of individual edges in experimentally derived graphs. here we focus on a small-world network derived from high-throughput (and error-prone) protein–protein interaction experiments. we exploit the neighborhood cohesiveness property of small-world networks to assess confidence for individual protein–protein interactions. by ascertaining how well each protein–protein interaction (edge) fits the pattern of a small-world network, we stratify even those edges with identical experimental evidence. this result promises to improve the quality of inference from protein–protein interaction networks in particular and small-world networks in general.
the lifetime and past-year prevalence of dual diagnosis in people with schizophrenia across europe: findings from the european schizophrenia cohort (eurosc) aims two major nomenclatures, diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition (dsm-iv) and international classification of diseases, tenth edition (icd-10), currently define substance use disorders for broad audiences of users with different training, experience and interests. a comparison of these definitions and their implications for dsm-v and icd-11 has not been available.   methods the background for the dependence concept and abuse, harmful use, withdrawal, substance-induced disorders and remission and other substance-related conditions is reviewed. reliability evidence is presented, as is validity evidence from approaches including psychometric, genetic and animal studies. the relevance of the dsm-iv and icd-10 compared to alternative systems (e.g. the addiction severity index) is considered.   results reliability and psychometric validity evidence for substance dependence is consistently strong, but more mixed for abuse and harmful use. findings on the genetics of alcohol disorders support the validity of the dependence concept, while animal studies underscore the centrality of continued use despite negative consequences to the concept of dependence. while few studies on substance-induced disorders have been conducted, those published show good reliability and validity when elements of dsm-iv and icd-10 are combined.   conclusions dependence in dsm-v and icd-11 should be retained, standardizing both criteria sets and adding a severity measure. the consequences of heavy use should be measured independently of dependence; add cannabis withdrawal if further research supports existing evidence; conduct further studies of the substance-induced psychiatric categories; standardize their criteria across dsm-v and icd-11; develop a theoretical basis for better remission criteria; consider changing substance 'abuse' to substance 'dysfunction disorder'; and conduct clinician education on the value of the diagnostic criteria.
prediction of a novel rna binding domain in crocodilepox zimbabwe gene 157 we describe muscle, a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. the speed and accuracy of muscle are compared with t-coffee, mafft and clustalw on four test sets of reference alignments: balibase, sabmark, smart and a new benchmark, prefab. muscle achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. without refinement, muscle achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from t-coffee and mafft, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. the muscle program, source code and prefab test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.
five dimensional 2-branes from special lagrangian wrapped m5-branes abstract we discuss mirror symmetry in generalized calabi–yau compactifications of type ii string theories with background ns-fluxes. starting from type iib compactified on calabi–yau threefolds with ns three-form flux we show that the mirror type iia theory arises from a purely geometrical compactification on a different class of six-manifolds. these mirror manifolds have su (3) structure and are termed half-flat ; they are neither complex nor ricci-flat and their holonomy group is no longer su (3). we show that type iia appropriately compactified on such manifolds gives the correct mirror-symmetric low-energy effective action.
symptom validity testing in medically unexplained pain: a chronic regional pain syndrome type 1 case series two commonly used symptom validity tests are the test of memory malingering (tomm) and word memory test (wmt). after examining tomm-wmt failure concordance rates, green [green, p. (2007). making comparisons between forced-choice effort tests. in k. b. boone (ed.), assessment of feigned cognitive impairment (pp. 50-77). new york: guilford] urged widespread adoption of the wmt, arguing the tomm is insensitive to feigned impairment. but green (2007) used a skewed concordance method that favored wmt (one tomm subtest vs. three wmt subtests). in the present study we compare pass/fail agreement rates with different combinations of tomm and wmt subtests in 473 persons seeking compensation for predominately mild neurological trauma. we replicated green (2007) using his asymmetrical method, but otherwise we found the wmt and tomm produce comparable failure rates in samples at-risk for exaggeration with balanced comparison (three tomm subtests vs. three wmt). further work is necessary to compare wmt and tomm specificities, as failure concordance designs establish reliability but are insufficient for proving validity.
challenging state-of-the-art move ordering with adaptive data structures this paper proposes a new algorithm, called best reply search (brs), for deterministic multiplayer games with perfect information. in brs, only the opponent with the strongest counter move is allowed to make a move. more turns of the root player can be searched resulting in long-term planning. we test brs in the games of chinese checkers, focus, and rolit™. in all games, brs is superior to the maxn algorithm. we show that brs also outperforms paranoid in chinese checkers and focus. in rolit, brs is on equal footing with paranoid. we conclude that brs is a promising search method for deterministic multiplayer games with perfect information.
treebank-based grammar acquisition for german an efficient bit-vector-based cky-style parser for context-free parsing is presented. the parser computes a compact parse forest representation of the complete set of possible analyses for large treebank grammars and long input sentences. the parser uses bit-vector operations to parallelise the basic parsing operations. the parser is particularly useful when all analyses are needed rather than just the most probable one.
a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
assessing the risk of lower extremity amputations using an administrative data‐based foot risk index in elderly patients with diabetes * objective—to separately evaluate peripheral arterial occlusive disease (paod) and foot ulcer and amputation history in a diabetic foot risk classification to predict foot complications. research design and methods—we evaluated 1,666 diabetic patients for 27.2 ± 4.2 months. patients underwent a detailed foot assessment and were followed at regular intervals. we used a modified version of the international working group on the diabetic foot's (iwgdf's) risk classification to assess complications during the follow-up period. results—there were more ulcerations, infections, amputations, and hospitalizations as risk group increased (χ2 for trend p < 0.001). when risk category 2 (neuropathy and deformity and/or paod) was stratified by paod, there were more complications in paod patients (p < 0.01). when risk group 3 patients (ulceration or amputation history) were separately stratified, there were more complications in subjects with previous amputation (p < 0.01). conclusions—we propose a new risk classification that predicts future foot complications better than that currently used by the iwgdf.
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in childhood is associated with cognitive test profiles in the geriatric population but not with mild cognitive impairment or alzheimer's disease examination of the mental state is essential in evaluating psychiatric patients.1 many investigators have added quantitative assessment of cognitive performance to the standard examination, and have documented reliability and validity of the several “clinical tests of the sensorium”.2*3 the available batteries are lengthy. for example, withers and hinton’s test includes 33 questions and requires about 30 min to administer and score. the standard wais requires even more time. however, elderly patients, particularly those with delirium or dementia syndromes, cooperate well only for short periods.4 therefore, we devised a simplified, scored form of the cognitive mental status examination, the “mini-mental state” (mms) which includes eleven questions, requires only 5-10 min to administer, and is therefore practical to use serially and routinely. it is “mini” because it concentrates only on the cognitive aspects of mental functions, and excludes questions concerning mood, abnormal mental experiences and the form of thinking. but within the cognitive realm it is thorough. we have documented the validity and reliability of the mms when given to 206 patients with dementia syndromes, affective disorder, affective disorder with cognitive impairment “pseudodementia”5t6), mania, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and in 63 normal subjects.
university of groningen integration of mouse and human genome-wide association data identifies kcnip 4 as an asthma gene asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease in children and adults. an important genetic component to asthma susceptibility has long been recognized, most recently through the identification of several genes (e.g., ormdl3, pde4d, hla‐dq, and tle4) via genome‐wide association studies.
druggable protein interaction sites are more predisposed to surface pocket formation than the rest of the protein surface motivation identifying the location of ligand binding sites on a protein is of fundamental importance for a range of applications including molecular docking, de novo drug design and structural identification and comparison of functional sites. here, we describe a new method of ligand binding site prediction called q-sitefinder. it uses the interaction energy between the protein and a simple van der waals probe to locate energetically favourable binding sites. energetically favourable probe sites are clustered according to their spatial proximity and clusters are then ranked according to the sum of interaction energies for sites within each cluster.   results there is at least one successful prediction in the top three predicted sites in 90% of proteins tested when using q-sitefinder. this success rate is higher than that of a commonly used pocket detection algorithm (pocket-finder) which uses geometric criteria. additionally, q-sitefinder is twice as effective as pocket-finder in generating predicted sites that map accurately onto ligand coordinates. it also generates predicted sites with the lowest average volumes of the methods examined in this study. unlike pocket detection, the volumes of the predicted sites appear to show relatively low dependence on protein volume and are similar in volume to the ligands they contain. restricting the size of the pocket is important for reducing the search space required for docking and de novo drug design or site comparison. the method can be applied in structural genomics studies where protein binding sites remain uncharacterized since the 86% success rate for unbound proteins appears to be only slightly lower than that of ligand-bound proteins.   availability both q-sitefinder and pocket-finder have been made available online at http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/qsitefinder and http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/pocketfinder
precise box score: extract more information from datasets to improve the performance of face detection the latest generation of convolutional neural networks (cnn) have achieved impressive results in challenging benchmarks on image recognition and object detection, significantly raising the interest of the community in these methods. nevertheless, it is still unclear how different cnn methods compare with each other and with previous state-of-the-art shallow representations such as the bag-of-visual-words and the improved fisher vector. this paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. we identify several useful properties of cnn-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the cnn output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. we also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully shared. in particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to cnn-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost. source code and models to reproduce the experiments in the paper is made publicly available.
menaquinone and iron are essential for complex colony development in bacillus subtilis abstract this report describes the construction and characterization of a mariner-based transposon system designed to be used in bacillus subtilis, but potentially applicable to other gram-positive bacteria. two puc19-derived plasmids were created that contain the mariner-himar1 transposase gene, modified for expression in b. subtilis, under the control of either σa- or σb-dependent promoters. both plasmids also contain a transposable element (tnylb-1) consisting of a kanr cassette bracketed by the himar1-recognized inverse terminal repeats, as well as the temperature-sensitive replicon and ermr gene of pe194ts. tnylb-1 transposes into the b. subtilis chromosome with high frequency (10−2) from either plasmid. southern hybridization analyses of 15 transposants and sequence analyses of the insertion sites of 10 of these are consistent with random transposition, requiring only a “ta” dinucleotide as the essential target in the recipient dna. two hundred transposants screened for sporulation proficiency and auxotrophy yielded five spo− clones, three with insertions in known sporulation genes (kina, spovt, and yqfd) and two in genes (yban and yubb) with unknown functions. two auxotrophic mutants were identified among the 200 transposants, one with an insertion in lysa and another in a gene (yjzb) whose function is unknown.
fine-grained image classification via combining vision and language state-of-the-art methods for zero-shot visual recognition formulate learning as a joint embedding problem of images and side information. in these formulations the current best complement to visual features are attributes: manually-encoded vectors describing shared characteristics among categories. despite good performance, attributes have limitations: (1) finer-grained recognition requires commensurately more attributes, and (2) attributes do not provide a natural language interface. we propose to overcome these limitations by training neural language models from scratch, i.e. without pre-training and only consuming words and characters. our proposed models train end-to-end to align with the fine-grained and category-specific content of images. natural language provides a flexible and compact way of encoding only the salient visual aspects for distinguishing categories. by training on raw text, our model can do inference on raw text as well, providing humans a familiar mode both for annotation and retrieval. our model achieves strong performance on zero-shot text-based image retrieval and significantly outperforms the attribute-based state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the caltech-ucsd birds 200-2011 dataset.
establishing a core health record; a case study from norwegian healthcare there has been an increase in recent years in the number of in-depth case studies which focus on human actions and interpretations surrounding the development and use of computer-based information systems (is). this paper addresses philosophical and theoretical issues concerning the nature of such interpretive case studies, and methodological issues on the conduct and reporting of this type of research. the paper aims to provide a useful reference point for researchers who wish to work in the interpretive tradition, and more generally to encourage careful work on the conceptualisation and execution of case studies in the information systems field.
consensus of second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems with nonuniform time-delays and dynamically changing topologies in this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. we analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. we introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. we establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. this required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. it turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. we introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. a disagreement function is a lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. we proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. a distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. we provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
antibody expressing pea seeds as fodder for prevention of gastrointestinal parasitic infections in chickens plant viral vectors are being successfully developed and exploited for the industrial-scale expression of heterologous proteins and as a research tool for studies of gene expression. the initial engineering strategy (the 'full virus' vector strategy) aimed to design a vector that was essentially a wildtype virus, which was modified to carry and express a heterologous sequence that encoded a gene of interest. the new emerging trend (the 'deconstructed virus' vector strategy) reflects an ideology that recognises the inherent limitations of the viral process. it attempts to 'deconstruct' the virus, by eliminating functions that are limiting or undesired, and to rebuild it, either by delegating the missing necessary functions to the host (which is genetically modified to provide those functions) or by replacing them with analogous functions that are not derived from a virus.
investigation and identification of functional post-translational modification sites associated with drug binding and protein-protein interactions posttranslational modifications (ptms) define covalent and chemical modifications of protein residues. they play important roles in modulating various biological functions. current ptm databases contain important sequence annotations but do not provide informative 3d structural resource about these modifications. posttranslational modification structural database (ptm-sd) provides access to structurally solved modified residues, which are experimentally annotated as ptms. it combines different ptm information and annotation gathered from other databases, e.g. protein databank for the protein structures and dbptm and ptmcuration for fine sequence annotation. ptm-sd gives an accurate detection of ptms in structural data. ptm-sd can be browsed by pdb id, uniprot accession number, organism and classic ptm annotation. advanced queries can also be performed, i.e. detailed ptm annotations, amino acid type, secondary structure, scop class classification, pdb chain length and number of ptms by chain. statistics and analyses can be computed on a selected dataset of ptms. each ptm entry is detailed in a dedicated page with information on the protein sequence, local conformation with secondary structure and protein blocks. ptm-sd gives valuable information on observed ptms in protein 3d structure, which is of great interest for studying sequence–structure– function relationships at the light of ptms, and could provide insights for comparative modeling and ptm predictions protocols. database url: ptm-sd can be accessed at http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/ptm-sd/.
genome-wide analysis of the cellulose synthase-like (csl) gene family in bread wheat (triticum aestivum l.) backgroundthe cellulose synthase superfamily has been classified into nine cellulose synthase-like (csl) families and one cellulose synthase (cesa) family. the csl families have been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of the backbones of hemicelluloses of plant cell walls. with 17 plant and algal genomes fully sequenced, we sought to conduct a genome-wide and systematic investigation of this superfamily through in-depth phylogenetic analyses.resultsa single-copy gene is found in the six chlorophyte green algae, which is most closely related to the csla and cslc families that are present in the seven land plants investigated in our analyses. six proteins from poplar, grape and sorghum form a distinct family (cslj), providing further support for the conclusions from two recent studies. cslb/e/g/h/j families have evolved significantly more rapidly than their widely distributed relatives, and tend to have intragenomic duplications, in particular in the grape genome.conclusionour data suggest that the csla and cslc families originated through an ancient gene duplication event in land plants. we speculate that the single-copy csl gene in green algae may encode a mannan synthase. we confirm that the rest of the csl families have a different evolutionary origin than csla and cslc, and have proposed a model for the divergence order among them. our study provides new insights about the evolution of this important gene family in plants.
access control for iot nodes with energy and fidelity constraints the internet of things, like many future wireless sensor networks, is expected to follow a software defined paradigm, where protocol parameters and behaviors will be dynamically tuned as a function of the signal statistics. new protocols will be then injected as a software when certain events occur. for instance, new data compressors could be (re)programmed on-the-fly as the monitored signal type or its statistical properties change. in this paper, a lossy compression scenario is considered, where the application tolerates some distortion of the gathered signal in return for improved energy efficiency. to reap the full benefits of this paradigm, an automatic sensor profiling approach is discussed, where the signal class, and in particular the corresponding rate-distortion curve, is automatically assessed using machine learning tools (namely, support vector machines and neural networks). this curve can be reliably estimated on-the-fly through the computation of a small number (from ten to twenty) of statistical features on time windows of a few hundreds samples.
the effect of tobacco control measures during a period of rising cardiovascular disease risk in india: a mathematical model of myocardial infarction and stroke background cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, with 80% of cases occurring in developing countries. we therefore aimed to establish whether use of evidence-based multidrug regimens for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease would be cost-effective in low-income and middle-income countries.   methods we used a markov model to do a cost-effectiveness analysis with two combination regimens. for primary prevention, we used aspirin, a calcium-channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a statin, and assessed them in four groups with different thresholds of absolute risks for cardiovascular disease. for secondary prevention, we assessed the same combination of drugs in one group, but substituted a beta blocker for the calcium-channel blocker. to compare strategies, we report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (icer), in us dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (qaly).   findings we recorded that preventive strategies could result in a 2-year gain in life expectancy. across six developing world bank regions, primary prevention yielded icers of us746-890 dollars/qaly gained for patients with a 10-year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease greater than 25%, and 1039-1221 dollars/qaly gained for those with an absolute risk greater than 5%. icers for secondary prevention ranged from 306 dollars/qaly to 388 dollars/qaly gained.   interpretation regimens of aspirin, two blood-pressure drugs, and a statin could halve the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients. this approach is cost-effective according to who recommendations, and is robust across several estimates of drug efficacy and of treatment cost. developing countries should encourage the use of these inexpensive drugs that are currently available for both primary and secondary prevention.
determinants of protein abundance and translation efficiency in s. cerevisiae those trying to make sense of the notion of textual content and semantics within the wild, wild world of information retrieval, categorization, and filtering have to deal often with an overwhelming sea of problems. the really strange story is that most of them (myself included) still believe that developing a linguistically principled approach to text categorization is an interesting research problem. this will also emerge in the discussion of the book that is the focus of this review. learning to classify texts using support vector machines by thorsten joachims proposes a theory for automatic learning of text categorization models that has been repeatedly shown to be very successful. at the same time, the approach proposed is based on a rather rough linguistic generalization of (what apparently is) a language-dependent task: topic text classification (tc). the result is twofold: on the one hand, a learning theory, based on statistical learnability principles and results, that avoids the limitations of the strong empiricism typical of most text classification research; and on the other hand, the application of a naive linguistic model, the bag-of-words representation, to linguistic objects (i.e., the documents) that still achieves impressive accuracy.
refined nmr structure of α-sarcin by 15n–1h residual dipolar couplings the main limitation in nmr-determined structures of nucleic acids and their complexes with proteins derives from the elongated, non-globular nature of physiologically important dna and rna molecules. since it is generally not possible to obtain long-range distance constraints between distinct regions of the structure, long-range properties such as bending or kinking at sites of protein recognition cannot be determined accurately nor precisely. here we show that use of residual dipolar couplings in the refinement of the structure of a protein–rna complex improves the definition of the long-range properties of the rna. these features are often an important aspect of molecular recognition and biological function; therefore, their improved definition is of significant value in rna structural biology.
recovering missing labels of crowdsourcing workers we consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. a principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. we present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.
the role of n-glycosylation in folding, trafficking, and functionality of lysosomal protein cln5 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ncls) represent a group of children's inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in at least eight different genes. mutations in the cln5 gene result in the finnish variant late infantile ncl characterized by gradual loss of vision, epileptic seizures, and mental deterioration. the cln5 gene encodes a lysosomal glycoprotein of unidentified function. in this study, we have used both transient and stable expression systems for the characterization of cln5, focusing on the localization, processing, and intracellular trafficking. we show that cln5 is proteolytically cleaved, and that the mature polypeptide is transported to the lysosomes. our data provide the first evidence that soluble cln5 protein can also undergo mannose‐6‐phosphate receptor‐independent trafficking to the lysosomes. we studied the localization and maturation of the cln5 carrying the previously uncharacterized vlincl disease causing mutations in hela cells. all analyzed disease mutations disturb the lysosomal trafficking of the mutated cln5 proteins. the level of lysosomal targeting does not correlate, however, to disease onset, indicating that cln5 may also function outside lysosomes. this study furthers our understanding of the basic properties of the cln5 protein, necessary for the characterization of the consequences of disease mutations and for the planning of future therapies for vlincl. hum mutat 31:356–365, 2010. © 2010 wiley‐liss, inc.
ischemic defects in the electron transport chain increase the production of reactive oxygen species from isolated rat heart mitochondria. cardiac ischemia damages the mitochondrial electron transport chain. irreversible blockade of electron transport at complex i by rotenone decreases ischemic damage to cardiac mitochondria by decreasing the loss of cytochrome c and preserving respiration through cytochrome oxidase. therapeutic intervention to protect myocardium during ischemia and reperfusion requires the use of a reversible inhibitor that allows resumption of oxidative metabolism during reperfusion. amobarbital is a reversible inhibitor at the rotenone site of complex i. we asked whether amobarbital administered immediately before ischemia protected respiratory function. isolated rat hearts were perfused for 15 min followed by 25-min global ischemia at 37°c. amobarbital-treated hearts received drug for 1 min before ischemia. subsarcolemmal (ssm) and interfibrillar (ifm) populations of mitochondria were isolated after ischemia, and oxidative phosphorylation was measured. amobarbital protected oxidative phosphorylation, including through cytochrome oxidase, in both ssm and ifm in a dose-dependent manner, with an optimal dose of 2 to 2.5 mm. amobarbital also preserved cytochrome c content in both ssm and ifm. thus, reversible blockade of the electron transport chain during ischemia protects mitochondrial respiration.
multiple genetic associations with irish wolfhound dilated cardiomyopathy objectives to collect information on the cause of death and longevity of dogs owned by members of the numerically largest breed clubs of 169 uk kennel club-recognised breeds.   methods a cross-sectional study was carried out. approximately 58,363 questionnaires were sent out to breed club members in 2004 (nine clubs failed to report the exact number of questionnaires sent out). owners reported age at death and cause(s) of death for all dogs that had died within the previous 10 years.   results a total of 13,741 questionnaires (24% response rate) containing information on 15,881 deaths were included in the analysis. breed-specific response rates ranged from 64·7 to 4·5%. the median age at death was 11 years and 3 months (minimum=2 months, maximum=23 years and 5 months) and it varied by breed. the most common causes of death were cancer (n=4282, 27%), "old age" (n=2830, 18%) and cardiac conditions (n=1770, 11%).   clinical significance this survey shows breed differences in lifespan and causes of death, and the results support previous evidence that smaller breeds tend to have longer lifespan compared with larger breeds. although many of the breeds in the study may not be representative of the general pedigree dog population in the uk, the results do contribute to the limited information currently available.
interannual home range variation, territoriality and overlap in breeding bonelli’s eagles (aquila fasciata) tracked by gps satellite telemetry home range behaviour is a common pattern of space use, having fundamental consequences for ecological processes. however, a general mechanistic explanation is still lacking. research is split into three separate areas of inquiry - movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach - which have developed without much productive contact. here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. we discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.
model evolution with equality - revised and implemented researchers who make theoretical advances also need some way to demonstrate that an advance really does have general, overall positive consequences for system performance. for this it is necessary to evaluate the system on a set of problems that is sufficiently large and diverse to be somehow representative of the intended application area as a whole. it is only a small step from system evaluation to a communal system competition. the cade atp system competition (casc) has been run annually since 1996. any competition is difficult to design and organize in the first instance, and to then run over the years. in order to obtain the full benefits of a competition, a thoroughly organized event, with an unambiguous and motivated design, is necessary. for some issues relevant to the casc design, inevitable constraints have emerged. for other issues there have been several choices, and decisions have had to be made. this paper describes the evolution of casc, paying particular attention to its design, design changes, and organization.
easy and efficient protocol for oomycete dna extraction suitable for population genetic analysis backgroundmicrosatellites or single sequence repeats (ssrs) are a powerful choice of marker in the study of phytophthora population biology, epidemiology, ecology, genetics and evolution. a strategy was tested in which the publicly available unigene datasets extracted from genome sequences of p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum were mined for candidate ssr markers that could be applied to a wide range of phytophthora species.resultsa first approach, aimed at the identification of polymorphic ssr loci common to many phytophthora species, yielded 171 reliable sequences containing 211 ssrs. microsatellites were identified from 16 target species representing the breadth of diversity across the genus. repeat number ranged from 3 to 16 with most having seven repeats or less and four being the most commonly found. trinucleotide repeats such as (aag)n, (agg)n and (agc)n were the most common followed by pentanucleotide, tetranucleotide and dinucleotide repeats. a second approach was aimed at the identification of useful loci common to a restricted number of species more closely related to p. sojae (p. alni, p. cambivora, p. europaea and p. fragariae). this analysis yielded 10 trinucleotide and 2 tetranucleotide ssrs which were repeated 4, 5 or 6 times.conclusionkey studies on inter- and intra-specific variation of selected microsatellites remain. despite the screening of conserved gene coding regions, the sequence diversity between species was high and the identification of useful ssr loci applicable to anything other than the most closely related pairs of phytophthora species was challenging. that said, many novel ssr loci for species other than the three 'source species' (p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum) are reported, offering great potential for the investigation of phytophthora populations. in addition to the presence of microsatellites, many of the amplified regions may represent useful molecular marker regions for other studies as they are highly variable and easily amplifiable from different phytophthora species.
muscle energetics changes throughout maturation: a quantitative 31p-mrs analysis. net forward adenosine triphosphate (atp) production rates were calculated from 31p nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) kinetic data collected with 1–8 s time resolution during isometric voluntary contractions of the human gastrocnemius/soleus muscle group. volume normalized muscle output (newtons/ml) was then divided by the calculated net atp use (mm/s) to estimate the metabolic economy (me) (newtons · s/μpmol atp). the atp production rates from anaerobic glycolysis (an gly) and creatine kinase (ck) reactions are approximately half of the oxidative phosphorylation atp production rates (ox phos) at the end of 90 s of isometric contractions for a series of force levels. however, me was independent of the force level in these exercises. the correlation between mvc of healthy, trained subjects, and the maximal cross‐sectional area of the gastrocnemius/soleus shows an average of 21.2 ± 4.6 newtons/cm2 (mean ± sd, n = 15). this was measured using a foot pedal with a transducer measurement point 10.6 cm above the heel. [adp] versus ox phos atp production rate fits a michaelis‐menten kinetic control equation with an offset (underestimation of ox phos) of 0.3 m, ws and a km, = 27 μm for adp and a vmax = 1.0 mm/s. this suggests that [adp] is the controlling factor for mitochondrial function at the end of a 90 to 120 s isometric contraction in normal subjects at any force level. quantitative measurements of the phosphorus metabolite concentrations were obtained from 20 individuals and these data are also reported.
apoptosis of bgc823 cell line induced by p‐hydroxymethoxybenzobijuglone, a novel compound from juglans mandshurica nine diarylheptanoids (1–9), one triterpene (10), one sesquiterpenoid (11), one naphthoquinone (12), four tetralones (13–16), one naphthalene carboxylic acid glucoside (17) and six naphthalenyl glycosides (18–23) were isolated from the roots ofjuglans mandshurica maxi-mowicz (juglandaceae), and their structures determined from the chemical and spectral data. here, we report the inhibitory effects, on the dna topoisomerases i and ii activities, of all these compounds. compounds10 and23 showed more potent inhibitory effects, on the dna topoisomerases i and ii (94.0 and 86.0% inhibitions at the concentration of 5 (μg/ml, respectively), than the positive control compounds, camptothecin and etoposide.
predicting disease-related genes using integrated biomedical networks the unified medical language system (http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov) is a repository of biomedical vocabularies developed by the us national library of medicine. the umls integrates over 2 million names for some 900,000 concepts from more than 60 families of biomedical vocabularies, as well as 12 million relations among these concepts. vocabularies integrated in the umls metathesaurus include the ncbi taxonomy, gene ontology, the medical subject headings (mesh), omim and the digital anatomist symbolic knowledge base. umls concepts are not only inter-related, but may also be linked to external resources such as genbank. in addition to data, the umls includes tools for customizing the metathesaurus (metamorphosys), for generating lexical variants of concept names (lvg) and for extracting umls concepts from text (metamap). the umls knowledge sources are updated quarterly. all vocabularies are available at no fee for research purposes within an institution, but umls users are required to sign a license agreement. the umls knowledge sources are distributed on cd-rom and by ftp.
reduced adipogenesis after lung tumor exosomes priming in human mesenchymal stem cells via tgfβ signaling pathway maresin1 (mar1) is a new docosahexaenoic acid-derived pro-resolving agent that promotes the resolution of inflammation. in this study, we sought to investigate the effect and underlining mechanisms of mar1 in modulating alveolar fluid clearance (afc) on lps-induced acute lung injury. mar1 was injected intravenously or administered by instillation (200 ng/kg) 8 h after lps (14 mg/kg) administration and afc was measured in live rats. in primary rat alveolar type ii epithelial cells, mar1 (100 nm) was added to the culture medium with lipopolysaccharide for 6 h. mar1 markedly stimulated afc in lps-induced lung injury, with the outcome of decreased pulmonary edema and lung injury. in addition, rat lung tissue protein was isolated after intervention, and we found mar1 improved epithelial sodium channel (enac), na,k-adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) protein expression and na,k-atpase activity. mar1 down-regulated nedd4-2 protein expression though pi3k/akt but not though pi3k/sgk1 pathway in vivo. in primary rat alveolar type ii epithelial cells stimulated with lps, mar1-upregulated enac and na,k-atpase protein abundance in the plasma membrane. finally, the lipoxin a4 receptor inhibitor (boc-2) and pi3k inhibitor (ly294002) not only blocked mar1’s effects on camp/cgmp, the expression of phosphorylated akt and nedd4-2, but also inhibited the effect of mar1 on afc in vivo. in conclusion, mar1 stimulates afc through a mechanism partly dependent on alveolar epithelial enac and na,k-atpase activation via the alx/pi3k/nedd4-2 signaling pathway. our findings reveal a novel mechanism for pulmonary edema fluid reabsorption and mar1 may provide a new therapy for the resolution of ali/ards.
rat mitochondrial atp synthase atp5g3: cloning and upregulation in pancreas after chronic ethanol feeding. we describe the cloning, sequence analysis, and chromosomal mapping of a novel mitochondrial atp synthase subunit 9cdna, p3. subunit 9 transports protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the f1-atpase protruding on the matrix side, resulting in the generation of atp. sequence analysis of the p3 cdna reveals only 80% identity with the human subunit 9 genes p1 and p2 in the dna sequence encoding the mature peptide. however, this sequence predicts a mature protein identical to p1 and p2. the predicted sequence of the p3 leader peptide differs from the p1 and p2 leaders, but retains the "rfs" motif critical for mitochondrial import and maturation. the p3 gene (atp5g3) maps to chromosome 2.
a cut-based heuristic to produce almost feasible periodic railway timetables during the last 15 years, many solution methods for the important task of constructing periodic timetables for public transportation companies have been proposed. we first point out the importance of an objective function, where we observe that in particular a linear objective function turns out to be a good compromise between essential practical requirements and computational tractability. then, we enter into a detailed empirical analysis of various mixed integer programming (mip) procedures — those using node variables and those using arc variables — genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and constraint programming. to our knowledge, this is the first comparison of five conceptually different solution approaches for periodic timetable optimization.
the dynamics of spending and absorption of aid: panel data analysis this paper proposes a new test for cross-sectional dependence in xed e¤ects panel data models. it is well known that ignoring cross-sectional dependence leads to incorrect statistical inference. in the panel data literature, attempts to account for cross-sectional dependence include factor models and spatial correlation. in most cases, strong assumptions on the covariance matrix are imposed. attempts at avoiding ad hoc specications rely on the sample covariance matrix. unfortunately, when the dimension of this variance-covariance matrix is large, the sample covariance matrix turns out to be an inconsistent estimator of the population covariance matrix. this is especially relevant for micro panels with a large number of cross-sectional units observed over a short time series span. this fact undermines existing tests based on the sample covariance matrix directly. this paper uses the random matrix theory based approach of ledoit and wolf (2002) to test for cross-sectional dependence of the error terms in linear large panel models with comparable number of cross-sectional units and time series observations. since the errors are unobservable, the residuals from the xed e¤ects regression are used. as shown in the paper, the di¤erence can not be ignored asymptotically, and the limiting distribution of the proposed test statistic is derived. additionally, its nite sample properties are examined and compared to the traditional tests for cross-sectional dependence using monte carlo simulations. keywords: cross-sectional dependence; panel data; fixed e¤ects; john test. jel classication: c13; c33. email addresses: badi h. baltagi, bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu; qu feng, qfeng@maxwell.syr.edu; chihwa kao, cdkao@maxwell.syr.edu.
gait recognition for human identification using fourier descriptor and anatomical landmarks a simple and inexpensive photographic method has been developed whereby many kinematic components of the walking act in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes can be measured and related temporally. a factorial design was used to study the displacement patterns of sixty normal men who ranged i
multi-task deep networks for depth-based 6d object pose and joint registration in crowd scenarios while 3d object detection and pose estimation has been studied for a long time, its evaluation is not yet completely satisfactory. indeed, existing datasets typically consist in numerous acquisitions of only a few scenes because of the tediousness of pose annotation, and existing evaluation protocols cannot handle properly objects with symmetries. this work aims at addressing those two points. we first present automatic techniques to produce fully annotated rgbd data of many object instances in arbitrary poses, with which we produce a dataset of thousands of independent scenes of bulk parts composed of both real and synthetic images. we then propose a consistent evaluation methodology suitable for any rigid object, regardless of its symmetries. we illustrate it with two reference object detection and pose estimation methods on different objects, and show that incorporating symmetry considerations into pose estimation methods themselves can lead to significant performance gains. the proposed dataset is available at http://rbregier.github.io/dataset2017.
a simple method for commonsense reasoning in this paper, we present an alternative to the turing test that has some conceptual and practical advantages. like the original, it involves responding to typed english sentences, and english-speaking adults will have no difficulty with it. unlike the original, the subject is not required to engage in a conversation and fool an interrogator into believing she is dealing with a person. moreover, the test is arranged in such a way that having full access to a large corpus of english text might not help much. finally, the interrogator or a third party will be able to decide unambiguously after a few minutes whether or not a subject has passed the test.
tumor necrosis factor-α and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 control reactive oxygen species release, mitochondrial autophagy and c-jun n-terminal kinase/p38 phosphorylation during necrotizing enterocolitis abstract: mitochondrial complexes i, ii, and iii were studied in isolated brain mitochondrial preparations with the goal of determining their relative abilities to reduce o2 to hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) or to reduce the alternative electron acceptors nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt) and diphenyliodonium (dpi). complex i and ii stimulation caused h2o2 formation and reduced nbt and dpi as indicated by dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation, nitroformazan precipitation, and dpi‐mediated enzyme inactivation. the o2 consumption rate was more rapid under complex ii (succinate) stimulation than under complex i (nadh) stimulation. in contrast, h2o2 generation and nbt and dpi reduction kinetics were favored by nadh addition but were virtually unobservable during succinate‐linked respiration. nadh oxidation was strongly suppressed by rotenone, but nadh‐coupled h2o2 flux was accelerated by rotenone. α‐phenyl‐n‐tert‐butyl nitrone (pbn), a compound documented to inhibit oxidative stress in models of stroke, sepsis, and parkinsonism, partially inhibited complex i‐stimulated h2o2 flux and nbt reduction and also protected complex i from dpi‐mediated inactivation while trapping the phenyl radical product of dpi reduction. the results suggest that complex i may be the principal source of brain mitochondrial h2o2 synthesis, possessing an “electron leak” site upstream from the rotenone binding site (i.e., on the nadh side of the enzyme). the inhibition of h2o2 production by pbn suggests a novel explanation for the broad‐spectrum antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity of this nitrone spin trap.
pp2a/b56 and gsk3/ras suppress pkb activity during dictyostelium chemotaxis protein kinases akt and pkbr1 of dictyostelium belong to the agc protein kinase superfamily. akt and pkbr1 are phosphorylated at similar sites by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (pdk1) and torc2 kinases; however, they have different subcellular localizing domains. akt has a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [ptdins(3,4,5)p3]-regulated ph (pleckstrin homology) domain whereas pkbr1 is myristoylated and persistently membrane localized. using strains defective for pi3k/ptdins(3,4,5)p3-, pdk1- and torc2-signaling or strains that express phospho-site mutants of akt and pkbr1, we dissect the different roles of pi3k/ptdins(3,4,5)p3, pdk1 and torc2. we show that activation of akt and pkbr1 requires pdk1-site phosphorylation, but that phosphorylation by torc2 is insufficient for akt or pkbr1 activation. however, pdk1-site phosphorylation is dependent on phosphorylation by torc2, which suggests that there is regulatory coordination among pdk1, torc2 and their phospho-site targets. this defines a separate input for signaling in control of chemotaxis and dependency on pdk1 function. we also demonstrate that pdk1 in dictyostelium functions independently of pi3k/ptdins(3,4,5)p3. finally, we show that akt and pkbr1 exhibit substrate selectivity and identify two novel lipid-interacting proteins preferentially phosphorylated by akt. despite certain similarities, akt and pkbr1 have distinct regulatory paths that impact activation and effector targeting, with pdk1 serving a central role.
kernel coupled distance metric learning for gait recognition and face recognition a biometrics technique based on metric learning approach is proposed in this paper to achieve higher correct classification rates under the condition that the feature of the query is very different from that of the register for a given individual. inspired by the definition of generalized distance, the criterion of this new metric learning is defined by finding an embedding that preserves local information and obtaining a subspace that best detects the essential manifold structure. furthermore, the two transformation matrices for the query and the register are obtained by a generalized eigen-decomposition. experiments tested on biometric applications of casia(b) gait database and the umist face database, demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than classical metric learning methods and the current radial basis function (rbf) algorithms.
prediction of a novel rna binding domain in crocodilepox zimbabwe gene 157 we describe muscle, a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. the speed and accuracy of muscle are compared with t-coffee, mafft and clustalw on four test sets of reference alignments: balibase, sabmark, smart and a new benchmark, prefab. muscle achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. without refinement, muscle achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from t-coffee and mafft, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. the muscle program, source code and prefab test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.
dna methylation as a mechanism of nutritional plasticity: limited support from horned beetles. background epigenetic modifications, such as cytosine methylation, are inherited in plant species and may occur in response to biotic or abiotic stress, affecting gene expression without changing genome sequence. laguncularia racemosa, a mangrove species, occurs in naturally contrasting habitats where it is subjected daily to salinity and nutrient variations leading to morphological differences. this work aims at unraveling how cpg-methylation variation is distributed among individuals from two nearby habitats, at a riverside (rs) or near a salt marsh (sm), with different environmental pressures and how this variation is correlated with the observed morphological variation. principal findings significant differences were observed in morphological traits such as tree height, tree diameter, leaf width and leaf area between plants from rs and sm locations, resulting in smaller plants and smaller leaf size in sm plants. methyl-sensitive amplified polymorphism (msap) was used to assess genetic and epigenetic (cpg-methylation) variation in l. racemosa genomes from these populations. sm plants were hypomethylated (14.6% of loci had methylated samples) in comparison to rs (32.1% of loci had methylated samples). within-population diversity was significantly greater for epigenetic than genetic data in both locations, but sm also had less epigenetic diversity than rs. frequency-based (gst) and multivariate (βst) methods that estimate population structure showed significantly greater differentiation among locations for epigenetic than genetic data. co-inertia analysis, exploring jointly the genetic and epigenetic data, showed that individuals with similar genetic profiles presented divergent epigenetic profiles that were characteristic of the population in a particular environment, suggesting that cpg-methylation changes may be associated with environmental heterogeneity. conclusions in spite of significant morphological dissimilarities, individuals of l. racemosa from salt marsh and riverside presented little genetic but abundant dna methylation differentiation, suggesting that epigenetic variation in natural plant populations has an important role in helping individuals to cope with different environments.
the influence of 5-httlpr genotype on the association between the plasma concentration and therapeutic effect of paroxetine in patients with major depressive disorder objectiveparoxetine is believed to be a substrate of cyp2d6. however, no information was available indicating drug interaction between paroxetine and inhibitors of cyp2d6. the aim of this study was to examine the effects of terbinafine, a potent inhibitor of cyp2d6, on pharmacokinetics of paroxetine.methodstwo 6-day courses of either a daily 150-mg of terbinafine or a placebo, with at least a 4-week washout period, were conducted. twelve volunteers took a single oral 20-mg dose of paroxetine on day 6 of both courses. plasma concentrations of paroxetine were monitored up to 48 h after dosing.resultscompared with the placebo, terbinafine treatment significantly increased the peak plasma concentration (cmax) of paroxetine, by 1.9-fold (6.4 ± 2.4 versus 12.1 ± 2.9 ng/ml, p < 0.001), and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 48 h [auc (0–48)] of paroxetine by 2.5-fold (127 ± 67 vs 318 ± 102 ng/ml, p < 0.001). elimination half-life differed significantly (15.3 ± 2.4 vs 22.7 ± 8.8 h, p < 0.05), although the magnitude of alteration (1.4-fold) was smaller than cmax or auc.conclusionthe present study demonstrated that the metabolism of paroxetine after a single oral dose was inhibited by terbinafine, suggesting that inhibition of cyp2d6 activity may lead to a change in the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine. however, further study is required to confirm this phenomenon at steady state.
differential effect of left vs. right white matter hyperintensity burden on functional decline: the northern manhattan study an automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into brain and non‐brain has been developed. it is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of mr sequences. the method, brain extraction tool (bet), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. the method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre‐processing before being applied. we describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against “gold‐standard” hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods. hum. brain mapping 17:143–155, 2002. © 2002 wiley‐liss, inc.
activity-dependent degeneration of axotomized neuromuscular synapses in wlds mice axons in wlds mutant mice are protected from wallerian degeneration by overexpression of a chimeric ube4b/nmnat (wld) gene. expression of wld protein was independent of age in these mice. however we identified two distinct neuromuscular synaptic responses to axotomy. in young adult wlds mice, axotomy induced progressive, asynchronous synapse withdrawal from motor endplates, strongly resembling neonatal synapse elimination. thus, five days after axotomy, 50–90 % of endplates were still partially or fully occupied and expressed endplate potentials (epps). by 10 days, fewer than 20 % of endplates still showed evidence of synaptic activity. recordings from partially occupied junctions indicated a progressive decrease in quantal content in inverse proportion to endplate occupancy. in wlds mice aged > 7 months, axons were still protected from axotomy but synapses degenerated rapidly, in wild‐type fashion: within three days less than 5 % of endplates contained vestiges of nerve terminals. the axotomy‐induced synaptic withdrawal phenotype decayed with a time constant of ∼30 days. regenerated synapses in mature wlds mice recapitulated the juvenile phenotype. within 4–6 days of axotomy 30–50 % of regenerated nerve terminals still occupied motor endplates. age‐dependent synapse withdrawal was also seen in transgenic mice expressing the wld gene. co‐expression of wld protein and cyan fluorescent protein (cfp) in axons and neuromuscular synapses did not interfere with the protection from axotomy conferred by the wld gene. thus, wld expression unmasks age‐dependent, compartmentally organised programmes of synapse withdrawal and degeneration.

human loci involved in drug biotransformation: worldwide genetic variation, population structure, and pharmacogenetic implications equilibrium models of isolation by distance predict an increase in genetic differentiation with geographic distance. here we find a linear relationship between genetic and geographic distance in a worldwide sample of human populations, with major deviations from the fitted line explicable by admixture or extreme isolation. a close relationship is shown to exist between the correlation of geographic distance and genetic differentiation (as measured by f(st)) and the geographic pattern of heterozygosity across populations. considering a worldwide set of geographic locations as possible sources of the human expansion, we find that heterozygosities in the globally distributed populations of the data set are best explained by an expansion originating in africa and that no geographic origin outside of africa accounts as well for the observed patterns of genetic diversity. although the relationship between f(st) and geographic distance has been interpreted in the past as the result of an equilibrium model of drift and dispersal, simulation shows that the geographic pattern of heterozygosities in this data set is consistent with a model of a serial founder effect starting at a single origin. given this serial-founder scenario, the relationship between genetic and geographic distance allows us to derive bounds for the effects of drift and natural selection on human genetic variation.
psychometric properties of the mandarin version of the childhood autism spectrum test (cast): an exploratory study item response theory (irt) and categorical data factor analysis (cdfa) are complementary methods for the analysis of the psychometric properties of psychiatric measures that purport to measure latent constructs. these methods have been applied to relatively few child and adolescent measures. we provide the first combined irt and cdfa analysis of a clinical measure (the short mood and feelings questionnaire—smfq) in a community sample of 7-through 11-year-old children. both latent variable models supported the internal construct validity of a single underlying continuum of severity of depressive symptoms. smfq items discriminated well at the more severe end of the depressive latent trait. item performance was not affected by age, although age correlated significantly with latent smfq scores suggesting that symptom severity increased within the age period of 7–11. these results extend existing psychometric studies of the smfq and confirm its scaling properties as a potential dimensional measure of symptom severity of childhood depression in community samples.

oligodendrocyte precursor cells synthesize neuromodulatory factors during early neural development, the lineage specification of initially pluripotent progenitor cells is associated with proliferation, differentiation, and migration. oligodendroglial progenitor cells migrate from their sites of origin to reach the axons that they will myelinate. we have described a cell‐surface protein, an2, expressed by oligodendroglial progenitor cells in vitro and showed that antibodies against an2 inhibited the migration of cultured primary oligodendroglial progenitor cells, suggesting that the an2 antigen plays a role in their migration. recently, results from maldi mass spectroscopy showed that an2 is the mouse homologue of the rat ng2 protein. in this study, we have analyzed cells staining with an2 antibodies during development and in the adult murine central nervous system (cns), carried out double stainings with antibodies against ng2, and investigated the differentiation potential of cells in vitro after isolation from early postnatal brain using an2 antibodies. an2 and ng2 antibodies stained totally overlapping populations of cells in the cns. an2/ng2 expressing cells in embryonic and postnatal brain expressed the pdgf‐α‐receptor and in postnatal brain exhibited electrophysiological properties typical of glial progenitor cells. cells isolated from early postnatal brain using an2 monoclonal antibody developed into oligodendrocytes in low serum medium or into astrocytes in the presence of fetal calf serum. in the embryonic spinal cord, cells staining with an2 antibodies were found closely apposed to radial glial cells, suggesting that glial precursors, like neurons, may use radial glia as scaffolds for migration. glia 34:213–228, 2001. © 2001 wiley‐liss, inc.
discriminative paired dictionary learning for visual recognition dictionary learning (dl) for sparse coding has shown promising results in classification tasks, while how to adaptively build the relationship between dictionary atoms and class labels is still an important open question. the existing dictionary learning approaches simply fix a dictionary atom to be either class-specific or shared by all classes beforehand, ignoring that the relationship needs to be updated during dl. to address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel latent dictionary learning (ldl) method to learn a discriminative dictionary and build its relationship to class labels adaptively. each dictionary atom is jointly learned with a latent vector, which associates this atom to the representation of different classes. more specifically, we introduce a latent representation model, in which discrimination of the learned dictionary is exploited via minimizing the within-class scatter of coding coefficients and the latent-value weighted dictionary coherence. the optimal solution is efficiently obtained by the proposed solving algorithm. correspondingly, a latent sparse representation based classifier is also presented. experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms many recently proposed sparse representation and dictionary learning approaches for action, gender and face recognition.
hypobolic discounting and willingness-to-wait this paper tests whether heterogeneity of time preferences can explain individual credit behavior. in a field experiment targeting individuals from low-to-moderate income households, we measure individual time preferences through choice experiments, and then match these time preference measures to individual credit reports and annual tax returns. ; we find that, controlling for disposable income and other individual characteristics, individuals who are less patient have lower credit scores and higher default rates. moreover, people with dynamically inconsistent (quasi-hyperbolic) preferences have higher active borrowing levels.
an ensemble-based online learning algorithm for streaming data we present arow, an online learning algorithm for binary and multiclass problems that combines large margin training, confidence weighting, and the capacity to handle non-separable data. arow performs adaptive regularization of the prediction function upon seeing each new instance, allowing it to perform especially well in the presence of label noise. we derive mistake bounds for the binary and multiclass settings that are similar in form to the second order perceptron bound. our bounds do not assume separability. we also relate our algorithm to recent confidence-weighted online learning techniques. empirical evaluations show that arow achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of binary and multiclass tasks, as well as robustness in the face of non-separable data.
efficient arq protocols with anti-jamming coding for cognitive radios while essentially all of the frequency spectrum is allocated to different applications, observations provide evidence that usage of the spectrum is actually quite limited, particularly in bands above 3 ghz. in this paper we present a cognitive radio approach for usage of virtual unlicensed spectrum (corvus), a vision of a cognitive radio (cr) based approach that uses allocated spectrum in a opportunistic manner to create "virtual unlicensed bands" i.e. bands that are shared with the primary (often licensed) users on a non-interfering basis. dynamic spectrum management techniques are used to adapt to immediate local spectrum availability. we define the system requirements for this approach, as well as the general architecture and basic physical and link layer functions of corvus.
tdag51 mediates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human proximal tubular epithelium. hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and accelerates atherosclerosis in apoe–/– mice. despite the observations that homocysteine causes endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress and programmed cell death (pcd) in cultured human vascular endothelial cells, the cellular factors responsible for this effect and their relevance to atherogenesis have not been completely elucidated. we report here that homocysteine induces the expression of t-cell death-associated gene 51 (tdag51), a member of the pleckstrin homology-related domain family, in cultured human vascular endothelial cells. this effect was observed for other er stress-inducing agents, including dithiothreitol and tunicamycin. tdag51 expression was attenuated in homozygous a/a mutant eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with homocysteine or tunicamycin, suggesting that er stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α is required for tdag51 transcriptional activation. transient overexpression of tdag51 elicited significant changes in cell morphology, decreased cell adhesion, and promoted detachment-mediated pcd. in support of these in vitro findings, tdag51 expression was increased and correlated with pcd in the atherosclerotic lesions from apoe–/– mice fed hyperhomocysteinemic diets, compared with mice fed a control diet. collectively, these findings provide evidence that tdag51 is induced by homocysteine, promotes detachment-mediated pcd, and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis observed in hyperhomocysteinemia.
de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis mainly occurs outside of plastids, but a previously undiscovered nucleobase importer provides substrates for the essential salvage pathway in arabidopsis[w] in a. thaliana the translation elongation factor ef-1 alpha is encoded by a small multigenic family of four members (a1-a4). the a1 gene promoter has been dissected and examined in a transient expression system using the gus reporter gene. deletion analysis has shown that several elements are involved in the activation process. one cis-acting domain, the tef 1 box, has been accurately mapped 100 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. this domain is the target for trans-acting factors identified in nuclear extracts prepared from a. thaliana. homologies are found between the tef 1 box and sequences present at the same location within the a2, a3 and a4 promoters. this observation, together with those obtained from gel retardation assays performed using dna fragments from the a4 promoter, suggest that the activation process mediated by the tef 1 element is conserved among the a. thaliana ef-1 alpha genes. analysis of nearly full length cdna clones has shown that in addition to a single intron located within the coding region, the a1 gene contains a second intron located within the 5' non coding region. such an intron is also present within the a2, a3 and a4 genes. this 5' intervening sequence appears to be essential to obtain a maximum gus activity driven by the a1 gene promoter.
extracting epidemiologic exposure and outcome terms from literature using machine learning approaches objective typically detected via electrocardiograms (ecgs), qt interval prolongation is a known risk factor for sudden cardiac death. since medications can promote or exacerbate the condition, detection of qt interval prolongation is important for clinical decision support. we investigated the accuracy of natural language processing (nlp) for identifying qt prolongation from cardiologist-generated, free-text ecg impressions compared to corrected qt (qtc) thresholds reported by ecg machines.   methods after integrating negation detection to a locally developed natural language processor, the knowledgemap concept identifier, we evaluated nlp-based detection of qt prolongation compared to the calculated qtc on a set of 44,318 ecgs obtained from hospitalized patients. we also created a string query using regular expressions to identify qt prolongation. we calculated sensitivity and specificity of the methods using manual physician review of the cardiologist-generated reports as the gold standard. to investigate causes of "false positive" calculated qtc, we manually reviewed randomly selected ecgs with a long calculated qtc but no mention of qt prolongation. separately, we validated the performance of the negation detection algorithm on 5000 manually categorized ecg phrases for any medical concept (not limited to qt prolongation) prior to developing the nlp query for qt prolongation.   results the nlp query for qt prolongation correctly identified 2364 of 2373 ecgs with qt prolongation with a sensitivity of 0.996 and a positive predictive value of 1.000. there were no false positives. the regular expression query had a sensitivity of 0.999 and positive predictive value of 0.982. in contrast, the positive predictive value of common qtc thresholds derived from ecg machines was 0.07-0.25 with corresponding sensitivities of 0.994-0.046. the negation detection algorithm had a recall of 0.973 and precision of 0.982 for 10,490 concepts found within ecg impressions.   conclusion nlp and regular expression queries of cardiologists' ecg interpretations can more effectively identify qt prolongation than the automated qtc intervals reported by ecg machines. future clinical decision support could employ nlp queries to detect qtc prolongation and other reported ecg abnormalities.
thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies in graves disease preferentially recognize the free a subunit, not the thyrotropin holoreceptor. we used the secreted tsh receptor (tshr) ectodomain variant tshr-289 (truncated at amino acid residue 289 with a 6-histidine tail) to investigate properties of tshr autoantibodies in graves' disease. sequential concanavalin a and ni-chelate chromatography extracted milligram quantities of tshr-289 (approximately 20-40% purity) from the culture medium. nanogram quantities of this material neutralized the tsh binding inhibitory activity in all 15 graves' sera studied. we generated a mouse monoclonal antibody (mab), 3bd10, to partially purified tshr-289. screening of a tshr complementary dna fragment expression library localized the 3bd10 epitope to 27 amino acids at the n-terminus of the tshr, a cysteine-rich segment predicted to be highly conformational. 3bd10 preferentially recognized native, as opposed to reduced and denatured, tshr-289, but did not interact with the tsh holoreceptor on the cell surface. moreover, mab 3bd10 could extract from culture medium tshr-289 nonreactive with autoantibodies, but not the lesser amount (approximately 25%) of tshr-289 molecules capable of neutralizing autoantibodies. although the active form of tshr-289 in culture medium was stable at ambient temperature, stability was reduced at 37 c, explaining the mixture of active and inactive molecules in medium harvested from cell cultures. in conclusion, studies involving a tshr ectodomain variant indicate the exquisite conformational requirements of tshr autoantibodies. even under "native" conditions, only a minority of molecules in highly potent tshr-289 preparations neutralize patients' autoantibodies. therefore, graves' disease is likely to be caused by even lower concentrations of autoantibodies than previously thought. finally, reciprocally exclusive binding to tshr-289 by human autoantibodies and a mouse mab with a defined epitope suggests that the extreme n-terminus of the tshr is important for autoantibody recognition.

expressed sequence tag analysis of guinea pig (cavia porcellus) eye tissues for neibank analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mrna/dna and cross-species protein alignments. a new tool, blat, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mrna/dna alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. blat's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping k-mers in the genome. this index fits inside the ram of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. blat has several major stages. it uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. it performs an alignment between homologous regions. it stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). finally, blat revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. this paper describes how blat was optimized. effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various k-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. blat is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based blat server for the human genome.
the role of atm in the deficiency in nonhomologous end-joining near telomeres in a human cancer cell line recent studies have implicated a poorly defined alternative pathway of nonhomologous end joining (alt-nhej) in the generation of large deletions and chromosomal translocations that are frequently observed in cancer cells. here, we describe an interaction between two factors, hmre11/hrad50/nbs1 (mrn) and dna ligase iiiα/xrcc1, that have been linked with alt-nhej. expression of dna ligase iiiα and the association between mrn and dna ligase iiiα/xrcc1 are altered in cell lines defective in the major nhej pathway. most notably, dna damage induced the association of these factors in dna ligase iv-deficient cells. mrn interacts with dna ligase iiiα/xrcc1, stimulating intermolecular ligation, and together these proteins join incompatible dna ends in a reaction that mimics alt-nhej. thus, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the alt-nhej pathway that not only contributes to genome instability in cancer cells but may also be a therapeutic target.
impact of alu repeats on the evolution of human p53 binding sites activation of the p53 network plays a central role in the inflammatory stress response associated with ulcerative colitis and may modulate cancer risk in patients afflicted with this chronic disease. here, we describe the gene expression profiles associated with four microenvironmental components of the inflammatory response (no*, h2o2, dna replication arrest, and hypoxia) that result in p53 stabilization and activation. isogenic hct116 and hct116 tp53-/- colon cancer cells were exposed to the no* donor sper/no, h2o2, hypoxia, or hydroxyurea, and their mrna was analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays. overall, 1,396 genes changed in a p53-dependent manner (p < 0.001), with the majority representing a "unique" profile for each condition. only 14 genes were common to all four conditions. included were eight known p53 target genes. hierarchical sample clustering distinguished early (1 and 4 hours) from late responses (8, 12, and 24 hours), and each treatment was differentiated from the others. overall, no* and hypoxia stimulated similar transcriptional responses. gene ontology analysis revealed cell cycle as a key feature of stress responses and confirmed the similarity between no* and hypoxia. cell cycle profiles analyzed by flow cytometry showed that no* and hypoxia induced quiescent s-phase and g2-m arrest. using a novel bioinformatic algorithm, we identified several putative p53-responsive elements among the genes induced in a p53-dependent manner, including four [kiaa0247, flj12484, p53csv (hspc132), and cnk (plk3)] common to all exposures. in summary, the inflammatory stress response is a complex, integrated biological network in which p53 is a key molecular node regulating gene expression.
influence of host plant-derived and abiotic environmental parameters on the composition of the diazotroph assemblage associated with roots of juncus roemerianus the degree of host specificity of most plant root associated bacteria is poorly under- stood. in this study we examined the physiological diversity of oxygen utilizing, culturable dia- zotrophs from the rhizoplane of the high marsh perennial glasswort salicornia virginica and com- pared them to diazotrophs from other salt marsh plants (tall and short spartina alterniflora, juncus roemerianus, and spartina patens) from the same ecosystem. forty-six pure culture strains were recovered from the rhizoplane of s. virginica by stab inoculating freshly collected roots into com- bined nitrogen-free semi-solid media, followed by streak plating of clonal outgrowths. the majority of these strains were gram-negative obligately aerobic or microaerophilic rods, but 3 gram-positive strains were also isolated and characterized. api 20ne test strips were used for preliminary charac- terization of all strains, yielding 22 physiologically different api strain groups. one representative strain was selected from each api group and tested for the presence of nifh, denoting strains capa- ble of n2-fixation. seventeen strains (14 gram-negative, 3 gram-positive) were nifh-positive and were characterized further using biolog test plates. four well-supported strain clusters were iden- tified by bootstrapped cluster analysis of the biolog substrate utilization profiles. these clusters differed in utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and amino acids. s. virginica diazotrophs were physiologically quite different from rhizoplane diazotrophs from the low marsh plants s. alterni- flora and j. roemerianus, but much more similar to diazotrophs from another high marsh plant, s. patens. we hypothesize that the observed physiological differentiation between high marsh and low marsh diazotrophs reflects differences in selection pressures in the rhizoplane microenvironment produced by plants with differing abilities to ventilate the rhizosphere. in addition, high and low marsh branches were further resolved into host-specific strain clusters, which also implies a strong impact of other host features, such as the suite of carbon exudate compounds produced, on the dis- tributions of specific diazotroph strains. these findings imply endemic, host-specific distributions of salt marsh diazotrophs and are consistent with the great diversity of diazotrophs that have been observed in this ecosystem to date.
use of fiber and fuzz mutants to detect qtl for yield components, seed, and fiber traits of upland cotton a genetic linkage map of chromosome 6 was constructed by using 270 recombinant inbred lines originated from an upland cotton cross (yumian 1 × t586) f2 population. the genetic map included one morphological (t1) and 18 ssr loci, covering 96.2 cm with an average distance of 5.34 cm between two markers. based on composite interval mapping (cim), qtl(s) affecting lint percentage, fiber length, fiber length uniformity, fiber strength and spiny bollworm resistance (earias spp.) were identified in the t1 locus region on chromosome 6. the allele(s) originating from t586 of qtls controlling lint percentage increased the trait phenotypic value while the alleles originating from yumian 1 of qtls affecting fiber length, fiber length uniformity, fiber strength and spiny bollworm resistance increased the trait phenotypic value.
two sympatric lineages of the raven corvus corax jordansi coexist on the eastern canary islands with a standard set of primers directed toward conserved regions, we have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify homologous segments of mtdna from more than 100 animal species, including mammals, birds, amphibians, fishes, and some invertebrates. amplification and direct sequencing were possible using unpurified mtdna from nanogram samples of fresh specimens and microgram amounts of tissues preserved for months in alcohol or decades in the dry state. the bird and fish sequences evolve with the same strong bias toward transitions that holds for mammals. however, because the light strand of birds is deficient in thymine, thymine to cytosine transitions are less common than in other taxa. amino acid replacement in a segment of the cytochrome b gene is faster in mammals and birds than in fishes and the pattern of replacements fits the structural hypothesis for cytochrome b. the unexpectedly wide taxonomic utility of these primers offers opportunities for phylogenetic and population research.
pparγ and colon and rectal cancer: associations with specific tumor mutations, aspirin, ibuprofen and insulin-related genes (united states) relative excess risk due to interaction, the proportion of disease among those with both exposures that is attributable to their interaction, and the synergy index have been proposed as measures of interaction in epidemiologic studies. this paper presents the methodology for obtaining confidence interval estimates of these indices utilizing routinely available output from multiple logistic regression software.
value and limitations of the duke criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. background q fever endocarditis is a life-threatening disease for which the diagnosis is usually based on serology. the major microbiologic criterion for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis (two separate positive blood cultures) cannot be achieved in most routine laboratories because of the biohazard associated with the culture of coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of q fever.   purpose recently, new criteria for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis have been proposed, and in this study we attempted to assess the suitability of these criteria specifically for the diagnosis of q fever endocarditis.   patients and methods to achieve this aim, we first selected from our series 20 recent cases in whom endocarditis had been confirmed following valvular pathological examination, and for whom microbiological evidence for the involvement of c burnetii was available. then, we applied the criteria proposed by the duke endocarditis service (ie, c burnetii positive serology being considered a minor criterion) to this cohort of patients but excluding pathological findings. although the duke endocarditis service criteria confirmed diagnosis in 16 of the patients, 4 were misclassified as "possible" cases (20%). however, when the q fever serological results (using an 1/800 antiphase i immunoglobulin g cut off) and single blood culture results were changed from minor to major diagnostic criteria, endocarditis was confirmed in them all. a second time, prospectively, we applied the duke endocarditis service criteria to a further 5 patients affected with q fever endocarditis. strict application of these criteria resulted in 1 of the 5 being misdiagnosed. applying the suggested modification for c burnetii results, all 5 were confirmed as having infectious endocarditis.   conclusion we propose that the modifications discussed in this study be applied to the duke endocarditis service criteria in order that the diagnosis of c burnetii induced endocarditis is improved.
coping with trial-to-trial variability of event related signals: a bayesian inference approach the bayesian approach to data analysis computes conditional probability distributions of quantities of interest (such as future observables) given the observed data. bayesian analyses usually begin with a full probability model a joint probability distribution for all the observable and unobservable quantities under study and then use bayes' theorem (bayes, 1763) to compute the requisite conditional probability distributions (called posterior distributions). the theorem itself is innocuous enough. in its simplest form, if q denotes a quantity of interest and d denotes data, the theorem states: p(qjd) = p(djq)£ p(q)=p(d):
altered retinoic acid metabolism in diabetic mouse kidney identified by 18o isotopic labeling and 2d mass spectrometry liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. as most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. the target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (fp) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.
individual differences in locomotor reactivity to a novel environment and sensitivity to opioid drugs in the rat. ii. agonist-induced antinociception and antagonist-induced suppression of fluid consumption in c6 glioma cells stably expressing a homogeneous population of the cloned rat mu opioid receptor, the binding affinities of opioid agonists and subsequent activation of g protein were examined. opioid receptor number in membranes of these cells was high (10-30 pmol/mg protein [3h]diprenorphine binding sites). opioids were found to bind to the receptor with high affinity [tyr-d-ala-gly-(me)phe-gly-ol (damgo) 0.23 nm; sufentanil 0.034 nm; morphine 0.16 nm]. activation of g protein by opioid agonists was examined by measuring the stimulation of guanosine-5'-o-(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate ([35s]gtp gamma s) binding. sufentanil increased [35s]gtp gamma s binding by 326% with an ec50 value of 2.39 nm. agonist stimulation of [35s]gtp gamma s binding was stereoselective, naltrexone-reversible, and pertussis toxin-sensitive. the "intrinsic activity" of opioids at the mu receptor was reflected by the magnitude of agonist-mediated activation of g protein. the rank order of the stimulation of [35s]gtp gamma s binding was etonitazene = sufentanil = damgo = plo17 = fentanyl > morphine > profadol > meperidine > butorphanol = nalbuphine = pentazocine > cyclazocine = nalorphine > levallorphan > naltrexone. high affinity binding of ligands to the mu opioid receptor was reduced by the addition of sodium and guanosine diphosphate at concentrations used in the [35s]gtp gamma s binding assay. ligand affinity was reduced in a manner correlating with "intrinsic activity". damgo, 1229-fold, nalbuphine 35-fold, naltrexone, 3-fold. the results presented show that the stable expression of the rat mu opioid receptor in c6 cells provides an effective tool to examine opioid receptor signal transduction mechanisms and evaluate the activity of novel opioids at the mu receptor.
red-worcester - traffic sensitive active queue management this paper proposes a mechanism for equation-based congestion control for unicast traffic. most best-effort traffic in the current internet is well-served by the dominant transport protocol, tcp. however, traffic such as best-effort unicast streaming multimedia could find use for a tcp-friendly congestion control mechanism that refrains from reducing the sending rate in half in response to a single packet drop. with our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, where a loss event consists of one or more packets dropped within a single round-trip time. we use both simulations and experiments over the internet to explore performance.
train longer, generalize better: closing the generalization gap in large batch training of neural networks the stochastic gradient descent (sgd) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many deep learning tasks. these methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say $32$-$512$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. it has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. we investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. in contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. we discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.
electrical characterization of conductive textile materials and its evaluation as electrodes for venous occlusion plethysmography development of textile-based electrodes and motion sensors is one of the main issues of recent smart textile research utilizing electronic textiles. electrocardiogram (ecg) electrodes have been developed by various textile technologies such as sputtering or electroless-plating on the fabric surfaces, and embroidering or knitting with stainless steel yarns. in addition, two types of motion sensors have also been developed using piezo-resistive textiles. they were fabricated by knitting and braiding. to examine the usability of the ecg electrode, waveforms of the conventional agcl electrode, and the new electrodes developed in our lab were compared. it was found that electrodes using metallic embroidering are more efficient when its substrate was a metal blended fabric. the electrolessly cu/ni plated fabrics obtained the best conductivity in textile-based electrodes. the first motion-measuring textile-based sensor was used to predict and measure the changes in electric resistances that accompany the angle changes in the elbow joint. an advanced piezo-resistive textile by braiding showed more accurate resistance changes and also better durability. changes in its electrical resistance were mapped to changes in its length extension. from the relationship between the extension and the electrical resistance, movement or posture of human body was detected.
comparison between supervised and unsupervised learning of probabilistic linear discriminant analysis mixture models for speaker verification many current face recognition algorithms perform badly when the lighting or pose of the probe and gallery images differ. in this paper we present a novel algorithm designed for these conditions. we describe face data as resulting from a generative model which incorporates both within-individual and between-individual variation. in recognition we calculate the likelihood that the differences between face images are entirely due to within-individual variability. we extend this to the non-linear case where an arbitrary face manifold can be described and noise is position-dependent. we also develop a "tied" version of the algorithm that allows explicit comparison across quite different viewing conditions. we demonstrate that our model produces state of the art results for (i) frontal face recognition (ii) face recognition under varying pose.
interleukin-17 causes rho-kinase-mediated endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. chronic treatment with the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin leads to hypertension; however, the mechanisms are unknown. rapamycin binds fk506 binding protein 12 and its related isoform 12.6 (fkbp12/12.6) and displaces them from intracellular ca release channels (ryanodine receptors) eliciting a ca leak from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum. we tested whether this ca leak promotes conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase phosphorylation at thr495, which reduces production of the vasodilator no. rapamycin treatment of control mice for 7 days, as well as genetic deletion of fkbp12.6, increased systolic arterial pressure significantly compared with controls. untreated aortas from fkbp12.6 / mice and in vitro rapamycin-treated control aortas had similarly decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation responses and no production and increased endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and protein kinase c activity. inhibition of either conventional protein kinase c or ryanodine receptor restored endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and endothelial function to control levels. rapamycin induced a small increase in basal intracellular ca levels in isolated endothelial cells, and rapamycin or fkbp12.6 gene deletion decreased acetylcholine-induced intracellular ca release, all of which were reversed by ryanodine. these data demonstrate that displacement of fkbp12/12.6 from ryanodine receptors induces an endothelial intracellular ca leak and increases conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation leading to decreased no production and endothelial dysfunction. this molecular mechanism may, in part, explain rapamycin-induced hypertension.

transcriptome sequencing and expression analysis of cadmium (cd) transport and detoxification related genes in cd-accumulating salix integra heavy metal (hm)-accumulating herbaceous and woody plants are employed for phytoremediation. to develop improved strategies for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency, knowledge of the microstructural, physiological and molecular responses underlying hm-accumulation is required. here we review the progress in understanding the structural, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification, as well as the regulation of these processes by signal transduction in response to hm exposure. the significance of genetic engineering for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency is also discussed. in herbaceous plants, hms are taken up by roots and transported into the root cells via transmembrane carriers for nutritional ions. the hms absorbed by root cells can be further translocated to the xylem vessels and unloaded into the xylem sap, thereby reaching the aerial parts of plants. hms can be sequestered in the cell walls, vacuoles and the golgi apparatuses. plant roots initially perceive hm stress and trigger the signal transduction, thereby mediating changes at the molecular, physiological, and microstructural level. signaling molecules such as phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no), modulate plant responses to hms via differentially expressed genes, activation of the antioxidative system and coordinated cross talk among different signaling molecules. a number of genes participated in hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification have been functionally characterized and transformed to target plants for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency. fast growing woody plants hold an advantage over herbaceous plants for phytoremediation in terms of accumulation of high hm-amounts in their large biomass. presumably, woody plants accumulate hms using similar mechanisms as herbaceous counterparts, but the processes of hm accumulation and signal transduction can be more complex in woody plants.
thomas vicary and the anatomie of mans body glutamatergic signaling is regulated, in part, through differential expression of nmda and ampa/ka channel subunits and g protein‐coupled metabotropic receptors. in human brain, region‐specific expression patterns of glutamate receptor genes are maintained over the course of decades, suggesting a role for molecular mechanisms involved in long‐term regulation of transcription, including methylation of lysine residues at histone n‐terminal tails. using a native chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we studied histone methylation marks at proximal promoters of 16 ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor genes (grin1,2a–d; gria1,3,4; grik2,4,5; grm1,3,4,6,7 ) in cerebellar cortex collected across a wide age range from midgestation to 90 years old. levels of di‐ and trimethylated histone h3‐lysine 4, which are associated with open chromatin and transcription, showed significant differences between promoters and a robust correlation with corresponding mrna levels in immature and mature cerebellar cortex. in contrast, levels of trimethylated h3‐lysine 27 and h4‐lysine 20, two histone modifications defining silenced or condensed chromatin, did not correlate with transcription but were up‐regulated overall in adult cerebellum. furthermore, differential gene expression patterns in prefrontal and cerebellar cortex were reflected by similar differences in h3‐lysine 4 methylation at promoters. together, these findings suggest that histone lysine methylation at gene promoters is involved in developmental regulation and maintenance of region‐specific expression patterns of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. the association of a specific epigenetic mark, h3‐(methyl)‐lysine 4, with the molecular architecture of glutamatergic signaling in human brain has potential implications for schizophrenia and other disorders with altered glutamate receptor function.
interactive comment on “ observation of slant column no 2 using the super-zoom mode of aura-omi ” we present a new algorithm for the near-real time retrieval ? within 3 h of the actual satellite measurement ? of tropospheric no2 columns from the ozone monitoring instrument (omi). the retrieval system is based on the combined retrieval-assimilation-modelling approach developed at knmi for off-line tropospheric no2 from the gome and sciamachy satellite instruments. we have adapted the off-line system such that the required a priori information ndash; profile shapes and stratospheric background no2 ndash; is now immediately available upon arrival of the omi no2 slant columns and cloud data at knmi. slant column no2 and cloud information arrives at knmi typically within 80 min of actual omi observations. slant columns for no2 are retrieved using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (doas) in the 405?465 nm range. cloud fraction and cloud pressure are provided by a new cloud retrieval algorithm that uses the absorption of the o2?o2 collision complex near 477 nm. on-line availability of stratospheric slant columns and no2 profiles is achieved by running the tm4 chemistry transport model (ctm) forward in time based on forecast ecmwf meteo and assimilated no2 information from all previously observed orbits. omi no2 slant columns, after correction for spurious across-track variability, show a random error for individual pixels of approximately 0.7×1015molec.cm?2. as no2 retrievals are very sensitive to clouds, we evaluated the consistency of cloud fraction and cloud pressure from the new o2?o2 (omi) algorithm and from the fast retrieval scheme for cloud observables (fresco). cloud parameters from the o2?o2 (omi) algorithm have similar frequency distributions as cloud parameters retrieved from fresco (sciamachy) for august 2006. on average, omi cloud fractions are higher by 0.011, and omi cloud pressures exceed fresco cloud pressures by 60 hpa. as a consistency check, we intercompared omi near-real time no2 columns measured at 13:45 h local time to sciamachy off-line no2 columns measured at 10:00 h local time. in august 2006, both instruments observe very similar spatial patterns of tropospheric no2 columns, and small differences for most locations on earth where tropospheric no2 columns are small. for regions that are strongly polluted, sciamachy observes higher tropospheric no2 columns than omi.
social and environmental influences on tartary buckwheat (fagopyrum tataricum gaertn.) varietal diversity in yunnan, china we wish to report a simple and rapid method for the fractionation of water-soluble substances. the method is based on a column procedure similar to chromatography in which the stationary phase is comprised of a new type of gel. these gels consist of hydrophilic chains which are cross-linked. they are devoid of ionic groups, the polar character being almost entirely due to the high content of hydroxyl groups. while water-insoluble, the gels are never-theless capable of considerable swelling. the fractionation depends primarily on differences in molecular size although phenomena have been observed which indicate the influence of other factors.
recurrent slice networks for 3d segmentation of point clouds a longstanding question in computer vision concerns the representation of 3d shapes for recognition: should 3d shapes be represented with descriptors operating on their native 3d formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors? we address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3d shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2d images. we first present a standard cnn architecture trained to recognize the shapes' rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3d shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3d shape descriptors. recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. in addition, we present a novel cnn architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3d shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. the same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. we conclude that a collection of 2d views can be highly informative for 3d shape recognition and is amenable to emerging cnn architectures and their derivatives.
impact of dietary branched chain amino acids concentration on broiler chicks during aflatoxicosis. a 3-wk feeding study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of turmeric (curcuma longa) powder (tmp), containing a known level of curcumin, and a hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (hscas; improved milbond-tx, imtx, an adsorbent, milwhite inc., houston, tx) to ameliorate the adverse effects of aflatoxin b(1) (afb(1)) in broiler chicks. four pen replicates of 5 chicks each were assigned to each of 7 dietary treatments, which included the basal diet not containing tmp, hscas, or afb(1) (control); basal diet supplemented with 0.5% food grade tmp that contained 1.48% total curcuminoids (74 mg/kg); basal diet supplemented with 0.5% hscas; basal diet supplemented with 1.0 mg/kg afb(1); basal diet supplemented with 0.5% tmp and 1.0 mg/kg afb(1); basal diet supplemented with 0.5% hscas and 1.0 mg/kgafb(1); and basal diet supplemented with 0.5% tmp, 0.5% hscas, and 1.0 mg/kg afb(1). the addition of tmp to the afb(1) diet significantly (p < 0.05) improved the weight gain of chicks, and the addition of hscas to the afb(1) diet significantly (p < 0.05) improved feed intake and weight gain, and reduced relative liver weight. the addition of tmp or hscas and tmp with hscas ameliorated the adverse effects of afb(1) on some of the serum chemistry parameters (total protein, albumin, cholesterol, calcium). further, decreased antioxidant functions in terms of level of peroxides, superoxide dismutase activity, and total antioxidant concentration in liver homogenate due to afb1 were also alleviated by the inclusion of tmp, hscas, or both. the reduction in the severity of hepatic microscopic lesions due to supplementation of the afb(1) diet with tmp and hscas demonstrated the protective action of the antioxidant and adsorbent used in the present study.
mvlfda-based video preference estimation using complementary properties of features in computer vision and multimedia search, it is common to use multiple features from different views to represent an object. for example, to well characterize a natural scene image, it is essential to find a set of visual features to represent its color, texture, and shape information and encode each feature into a vector. therefore, we have a set of vectors in different spaces to represent the image. conventional spectral-embedding algorithms cannot deal with such datum directly, so we have to concatenate these vectors together as a new vector. this concatenation is not physically meaningful because each feature has a specific statistical property. therefore, we develop a new spectral-embedding algorithm, namely, multiview spectral embedding (mse), which can encode different features in different ways, to achieve a physically meaningful embedding. in particular, mse finds a low-dimensional embedding wherein the distribution of each view is sufficiently smooth, and mse explores the complementary property of different views. because there is no closed-form solution for mse, we derive an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm to obtain the low-dimensional embedding. empirical evaluations based on the applications of image retrieval, video annotation, and document clustering demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
robust matrix regression the paradigm of perceptual fusion provides robust solutions to computer vision problems. by combining the outputs of multiple vision modules, the assumptions and constraints of each module are factored out to result in a more robust system overall. the integration of di!erent modules can be regarded as a form of data fusion. to this end, we propose a framework for fusing di!erent information sources through estimation of covariance from observations. the framework is demonstrated in a face and 3d pose tracking system that fuses similarity-to-prototypes measures and skin colour to track head pose and face position. the use of data fusion through covariance introduces constraints that allow the tracker to robustly estimate head pose and track face position simultaneously. 2001 pattern recognition society. published by elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
the production of highly effective enzyme complexes of cellulases and hemicellulases based on the penicillium verruculosum strain for the hydrolysis of plant raw materials in 1944 nelson (1) described a calorimetric method which represented a distinct step forward. he devised a new arsenophosphate solution as the chromogenic agent, and for copper reagent selected one of our older carbonate-tartrate solutions which was devised for the iodometric technique. in the following year, in a new alkaline copper reagent, we replaced the carbonate-bicarbonate buffer by phosphate as the alkali (2) and suggested that this reagent could be used for the calorimetric technique with nelson’s reagent. subsequent observations convinced us, however, that this reagent is not suitable for accurate calorimetric work, because it interferes with the stability of the colors developed with chromogenic reagents, whereas, when carbonate is the alkali, nelson’s reagent yields very stable colors. the copper-carbonate-tartrate reagent that nelson selected (as weli as the phosphate reagent we recommended) has, however, definite disadvantages when used for calorimetry. since the reagent was devised for the iodometric technique, its copper content is far above the concentration needed in calorimetry and this excess copper requires a commensurate amount of tartrate to be kept in solution. since tartrate measurably reduces copper, especially when the reagent is heated, in calorimetry it is the main cause of deviations from beer’s law. we have therefore decreased the copper content of the reagent to the amount actually usable in calorimetry, and reduced the concentration of tartrate to the minimum required. the self-reduction of such a solution, we found, is virtually negligible. 1 liter of this reagent. contains 4 gm. of cus04.5hz0, 24 gm. of anhydrous na2c03, 16 gm. of nahc03, 12 gm. of rochelle salt, and 18 gm. of anhydrous na&os. preparation of reagent-the carbonate and rochelle salt are dissolved
knowledge management practices in turkish smes: a descriptive study for most companies the immediate challenge is to create a knowledge‐based business which can capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the emerging knowledge economy. this includes the challenge of gaining acceptability within the organization of the theory and practice of knowledge management. it also includes the challenge of institutionalizing the knowledge management process, with attention to both sharing existing knowledge and creating and commercializing new knowledge.
population genetics of toxoplasma gondii: new perspectives from parasite genotypes in wildlife. recent studies indicate that toxoplasma gondii isolates of many domestic hosts from brazil are genetically and biologically different from t. gondii isolates from usa and europe. however, little is known about genetics of t. gondii isolates from wild mammals in brazil. in this study, genotypes of 36 t. gondii isolates from capybaras (hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) from six counties in são paulo state, brazil, were determined. sixteen genotypes were identified using 11 genetic markers including sag1, sag2, sag3, btub, gra6, c22-8, c29-2, l358, pk1, apico and cs3. no classical clonal type i and type ii isolates were found, confirming other findings that these lineages are rare in brazil. eight of these 36 isolates were grouped into the common clonal lineages in brazil, previously designed as types bri, brii and briii. seven of the 16 genotypes were reported for the first time in this study. three of the 36 isolates showed mixed infections. analysis of mortality rates in infected mice indicated that type bri is highly virulent, type brii is intermediately virulent and type briii is non-virulent, which is in agreement with previous report. the allele types at the cs3 locus are strongly linked to mouse-virulence of the parasite. these genotyping results support previous findings that the t. gondii population is highly diverse in brazil.
fact-mng: tumor site specific web-based outcome instrument for meningioma patients objective this investigation was performed to construct a grading system for cranial base meningiomas that augments the current system of topographic labeling. this new system classifies cranial base meningiomas based on predicted surgical resection and patient outcomes.   methods two hundred thirty-two consecutive patients with cranial base meningiomas were surgically treated by the two senior authors between april 1993 and august 1997. using standard statistical tests, a large number of preoperative, intraoperative, and follow-up findings were analyzed for correlation with the extent of resection. these included the presence of previous radiotherapy, cranial nerve iii, v, and vi palsies, multiple fossa involvement, and vessel encasement.   results analysis revealed that each variable tested was independently and inversely correlated with total tumor resection (p < 0.002). we were able to construct a grading system based on these variables; when more variables are present, the grade is higher. with the grading system, lower-grade tumors were correlated with increased probabilities of total resection (r2 = 0.9947) and better patient outcomes, as measured by karnofsky performance scale scores (r = 0.9291). we also found that, as a group, patients who underwent subtotal resection exhibited worse karnofsky performance scale scores and had longer hospital stays.   conclusion the current system of classifying cranial base meningiomas provides no information regarding the tumor except location and no information concerning patient prognosis. we present a more useful system to categorize these tumors. our scheme must be tested at other centers to corroborate our findings. this new grading system should serve to guide surgical treatment, inform patients, and improve communication among surgeons.
diagnostic accuracy of the clapping test in parkinsonian disorders vascular parkinsonism (vp) is difficult to diagnose with any degree of clinical certainty. we investigated the importance of macroscopic cerebral infarcts and pathological findings associated with microscopic “small vessel disease” (svd) in the aetiology of vp. the severity of microscopic svd pathology (perivascular pallor, gliosis, hyaline thickening, and enlargement of perivascular spaces) and the presence of macroscopically visible infarcts were assessed in 17 patients with parkinsonism and no pathological evidence of either parkinson's disease or any histopathological condition known to be associated with a parkinsonian syndrome, and compared with age‐matched controls. microscopic svd pathology was significantly more severe in the parkinsonian brains. most patients presented with bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity together with a gait disorder characterised predominantly by a shuffling gait. four patients presented acutely with hemiparesis and then progressed to develop a parkinsonian syndrome. they could be distinguished from the remaining vp patients by the presence at autopsy of macroscopically visible lacunar infarcts in regions where contralateral thalamocortical drive might be reduced. the clinical features at presentation varied according to the speed of onset and the underlying vascular pathological state. new clinical criteria for a diagnosis of vp are proposed based on the clinicopathological findings of this study. © 2004 movement disorder society
age-associated endothelial dysfunction in rat mesenteric arteries: roles of calcium-activated k(+) channels (k(ca)). this study was designed to determine the age-related changes in the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization to acetylcholine (ach) and its contribution to relaxation in the isolated mesenteric artery from normotensive and hypertensive rats. membrane potentials and contractions were recorded in arteries from male wistar-kyoto (wky) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) that were 5-6 wk old (young), 6-8 mo old (adult), and 20-26 mo old (aged). endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations produced by ach, applied both at the resting state of the membrane and under conditions of depolarization with norepinephrine (10(-5) m), were markedly impaired in aged wky rats, adult shr, and aged shr. endothelium-dependent relaxations to ach in arterial rings precontracted with 10(-5) m norepinephrine were also impaired in aged wky rats, adult shr, and aged shr even in the presence of indomethacin. furthermore, in these rats, n omega-nitro-l-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide formation, showed potent inhibitory effects on the relaxations, whereas the 20 mm high k+ solution that reduces hyperpolarization had less pronounced effects. hyperpolarizations and relaxations to cromakalim (10(-5) m), a k(+)-channel opener, were on the whole preserved in aged rats. it would thus appear that the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization to ach is reduced with aging as well as by hypertension, and this would, in part, account for the impaired relaxation to ach in arteries of both aged rats and hypertensive rats.
multiview absolute pose using 3d – 2d perspective line correspondences and vertical direction a large number of absolute pose algorithms have been presented in the literature. common performance criteria are computational complexity, geometric optimality, global optimality, structural degeneracies, and the number of solutions. the ability to handle minimal sets of correspondences, resulting solution multiplicity, and generalized cameras are further desirable properties. this paper presents the first pnp solution that unifies all the above desirable properties within a single algorithm. we compare our result to state-of-the-art minimal, non-minimal, central, and non-central pnp algorithms, and demonstrate universal applicability, competitive noise resilience, and superior computational efficiency. our algorithm is called unified pnp (upnp).
mining super-secondary structure motifs from 3d protein structures: a sequence order independent approach. structure motifs are amino acid packing patterns that occur frequently within a set of protein structures. we define a labeled graph representation of protein structure in which vertices correspond to amino acid residues and edges connect pairs of residues and are labeled by (1) the euclidian distance between the c(alpha) atoms of the two residues and (2) a boolean indicating whether the two residues are in physical/chemical contact. using this representation, a structure motif corresponds to a labeled clique that occurs frequently among the graphs representing the protein structures. the pairwise distance constraints on each edge in a clique serve to limit the variation in geometry among different occurrences of a structure motif. we present an efficient constrained subgraph mining algorithm to discover structure motifs in this setting. compared with contact graph representations, the number of spurious structure motifs is greatly reduced. using this algorithm, structure motifs were located for several scop families including the eukaryotic serine proteases, nuclear binding domains, papain-like cysteine proteases, and fad/nad-linked reductases. for each family, we typically obtain a handful of motifs within seconds of processing time. the occurrences of these motifs throughout the pdb were strongly associated with the original scop family, as measured using a hyper-geometric distribution. the motifs were found to cover functionally important sites like the catalytic triad for serine proteases and co-factor binding sites for nuclear binding domains. the fact that many motifs are highly family-specific can be used to classify new proteins or to provide functional annotation in structural genomics projects.
high-level synthesis of digital microfluidic biochips the mixing of analytes and reagents for a biological or chemical lab-on-a-chip is an important, yet difficult, microfluidic operation. as volumes approach the sub-nanoliter regime, the mixing of liquids is hindered by laminar flow conditions. an electrowetting-based linear-array droplet mixer has previously been reported. however, fixed geometric parameters and the presence of flow reversibility have prevented even faster droplet mixing times. in this paper, we study the effects of varying droplet aspect ratios (height:diameter) on linear-array droplet mixers, and propose mixing strategies applicable for both high and low aspect ratio systems. an optimal aspect ratio for four electrode linear-array mixing was found to be 0.4, with a mixing time of 4.6 seconds. mixing times were further reduced at this ratio to less than three seconds using a two-dimensional array mixer, which eliminates the effects of flow reversibility. for lower aspect ratio (</=0.2) systems, we present a split-and-merge mixer that takes advantage of the ability to perform droplet splitting at these ratios, resulting in a mixing time of less than two seconds.
interactive exploration of large photo libraries next generation environments will change the way people work and live as they will provide new advances in areas ranging from remote work and education, e-commerce, gaming to information-on-demand. in many of these applications intelligent interpretation of multimedia data such as image, video and audio resources is necessary. in this paper we present an effective approach to handling image repositories providing the user with an intuitive interface of visualising and browsing large collections of pictures. based on the idea of similarity-based organisation of images where images that are visually similar are located close to each other in visualisation space, images are projected onto a sphere with which the user can interact. rotating the sphere reveals images of different colours while tilting operations focus on brighter or darker images. large image collections are handled through a hierarchical approach that brings up similar, previously hidden, images when zooming in on an area. furthermore, the way images are organised can be interactively changed by the user. our next generation browsing environment has been successfully tested on a large database of several thousand images.
atmospheric oh reactivities in the pearl river delta – china in summer 2006: measurement and model results the most important chemical cleaning agent of the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical, oh. it determines the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, and thereby controls the removal of nearly all gaseous atmospheric pollutants. the atmospheric supply of oh is limited, however, and could be overcome by consumption due to increasing pollution and climate change, with detrimental feedback effects. to date, the high variability of oh concentrations has prevented the use of local observations to monitor possible trends in the concentration of this species. here we present and analyse long-term measurements of atmospheric oh concentrations, which were taken between 1999 and 2003 at the meteorological observatory hohenpeissenberg in southern germany. we find that the concentration of oh can be described by a surprisingly linear dependence on solar ultraviolet radiation throughout the measurement period, despite the fact that oh concentrations are influenced by thousands of reactants. a detailed numerical model of atmospheric reactions and measured trace gas concentrations indicates that the observed correlation results from compensations between individual processes affecting oh, but that a full understanding of these interactions may not be possible on the basis of our current knowledge of atmospheric chemistry. as a consequence of the stable relationship between oh concentrations and ultraviolet radiation that we observe, we infer that there is no long-term trend in the level of oh in the hohenpeissenberg data set.
genome-wide association with c-reactive protein levels in clhns: evidence for the crp and hnf1a loci and their interaction with exposure to a pathogenic environment obesity and infectious agents are both sources of inflammatory stimuli that result in increased production of c-reactive protein (crp). rates of overweight and obesity are increasing globally, but for many populations, gains in body fat are set against a backdrop of high levels of pathogen exposure. our primary objective was to evaluate the extent to which adiposity and pathogenicity contribute to a double burden of inflammation in a population currently undergoing the nutrition transition. measures of adiposity, pathogen exposure, and infectious disease symptoms were evaluated as predictors of high-sensitivity crp concentration in plasma samples from 1875 women participating in the cebu longitudinal health and nutrition survey in the philippines. proxy measures of pathogen exposure included household crowding and cleanliness, quality of water source, mode of waste disposal, and fecal exposure. a series of maximum likelihood logistic regression models were used to predict a plasma crp concentration > 3 mg/l. waist circumference was the strongest anthropometric predictor of elevated crp [odds ratio (or) = 2.29; 95% ci = 2.00, 2.62; p < 0.001]. presence of infectious disease symptoms (or = 2.51; 95% ci = 1.84, 3.44; p < 0.001) and level of pathogen exposure (or = 1.56; 95% ci = 1.15, 2.12; p < 0.01) were also associated with elevated crp. these associations were independent of socioeconomic status and other health behaviors. overweight/obesity and infectious exposures are associated with elevated crp in the philippines; it is likely that other populations undergoing the nutrition transition are experiencing comparable double burdens of inflammatory stimuli. these results underscore the need for additional research on the contributions of pathogenicity, adiposity, and inflammation to global epidemics of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
cr-gan: learning complete representations for multi-view generation we introduce adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. the method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. the method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. the hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. some connections to related algorithms, on which adam was inspired, are discussed. we also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. empirical results demonstrate that adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. finally, we discuss adamax, a variant of adam based on the infinity norm.
increase in caesarean deliveries after the australian private health insurance incentive policy reforms objective to study the effectiveness of recent private health insurance (phi) reforms, in particular the 30% rebate and lifetime health cover, in terms of their stated aim of reducing the load on public hospitals.   methods combines the use of two new projection models - "private health insurance" (phi) and "new south wales hospitals" that use public and private hospital inpatient data from 1996-97 to 1999-2000, and nsw population and private health insurance coverage statistics.   results with the phi reforms 15% fewer individuals would use public hospitals in 2010 than without these reforms (around 18% fewer among the 40% most affluent australians and 9% among the 40% least affluent). lower public hospital usage would mainly be due to lifetime health cover.   conclusion if the phi reforms remain in place, in 2010 a significant proportion of hospital use would be redirected away from the public sector and towards the private sector, with the shift being greatest among better-off australians.
tissue-specific profiling reveals transcriptome alterations in arabidopsis mutants lacking morphological phenotypes[c][w] the rhd3 (root hair defective3) gene encodes a putative gtp-binding protein required for appropriate cell enlargement in arabidopsis. to obtain insight into the mechanisms of rhd3 regulation, we conducted a molecular genetic dissection of rhd3 gene expression and function. gene fusion and complementation studies show that the rhd3 gene is highly expressed throughout arabidopsis development and is controlled by two major regulatory regions. one regulatory region is located between −1,500 and −600 bp upstream of the rhd3 gene and is required for vascular tissue expression. the other region is intragenically located and includes the 558-bp first intron, which is responsible for high-level expression of rhd3 throughout the plant. the presence and location of this intron is essential for gene function because constructs lacking this intron or constructs with the intron in an abnormal position are unable to functionally complement therhd3 mutations. we also analyzed the role of otherrhd genes and the plant hormones auxin and ethylene inrhd3 regulation, and we determined that these act downstream or independently from the rhd3 pathway. this study shows that multiple levels of regulation are employed to ensure the appropriate expression of rhd3 throughout arabidopsis development.
kinetics of mg2+ unblock of nmda receptors: implications for spike‐timing dependent synaptic plasticity 1. activation and desensitization of n‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (nmda) receptors were studied in large outside‐out patches excised from cultured embryonic neurones dissociated from mouse forebrain. the patches were exposed to rapid changes of nmda or l‐glutamate concentrations in the presence of glycine at concentrations (10‐20 microm) saturating the modulatory site of the nmda receptor. 2. immediately after formation of the patch the responses to nmda and l‐glutamate showed a slow and small desensitization, even with high concentrations of agonist. during the following hour, the peak response either decreased or remained relatively stable, but in all cases the desensitization increased and accelerated until it stabilized. in this 'stabilized’ state, the desensitization produced by high concentrations of nmda (1 mm) or l‐glutamate (300 microm) had an exponential time course, with a time constant of about 30 ms. the ratio of the peak over the steady‐state current was in the order of 40 for nmda and about 30 for l‐glutamate. 3. concentration‐response curves were built for the peak and the plateau responses, for nmda and for l‐glutamate. the comparison of these curves indicated that (i) the ec50 of the peak (k(app) was always higher than the ec50 of the plateau (kss); (ii) the two ec50 values for nmda (k(app) and kss) were higher than those for l‐glutamate; (iii) the hill coefficient was close to 1.4 for each of the four curves. 4. the application of nmda or l‐glutamate at a low concentration for 3 s periods reduced the response to a subsequent application of the same agonist at a saturating concentration. the ic50 of this ‘predesensitization’, termed kpre, was lower than the ec50 of the steady‐state response, kss. 5. the onset rates of desensitization increased with the concentration of agonist. the ec50 of this relation was close to the value of k(app). 6. the decay of the currents at the end of a 3 s application of agonist was usually well described by the sum of two exponentials both of which were faster for nmda than for l‐glutamate. 7. the recovery from desensitization after a long (3 s) pulse of agonist was approximately exponential, with a time constant of about 0.5 s for nmda and about 3.5 s for l‐glutamate.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
whole blood genome-wide gene expression profile in males after prolonged wakefulness and sleep recovery. one of the main objectives in the analysis of microarray experiments is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed under two experimental conditions. this task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. the new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (rp) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. at the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false‐detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. we use the rp technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non‐parametric t‐test variant implemented in tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (sam). we also show that the rp results are reliable in highly noisy data. an analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the rp approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. in addition, using rp can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results.
for modeling the hiv / aids epidemic in sub-saharan africa background a country-by-country review of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) data was undertaken by the world health organization. this paper describes the methods used to make estimates of hiv prevalence.   results it is estimated that, globally, approximately 16.9 million adults were living with hiv infections at the end of 1994. the majority (66%) of the infections were in sub-saharan africa (over 11000000), followed by south and south east asia (over 3000000). estimated prevalence rates for hiv infection ranged from less than 1 per 100000 sexually active adult population to 18 per 100 (18%), with a median prevalence of 14 per 10000. in 50 countries the estimated hiv prevalence rate was less than 5 per 10000 sexually active adults. in 15 countries (all in sub-saharan africa) the prevalence rate was above 5%. the lowest estimated prevalence rates were seen in central and east asia and the highest in central and southern africa.   conclusions estimates of prevalent hiv infections are intended to give an indication of the magnitude of the hiv pandemic but, due to the difficulties in accurately assessing the levels of hiv infections in national populations, should be considered provisional.
effects of body fat on the associations of high-molecular-weight adiponectin, leptin and soluble leptin receptor with metabolic syndrome in chinese the metabolic syndrome has received increased attention in the past few years. this statement from the american heart association (aha) and the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) is intended to provide up-to-date guidance for professionals on the diagnosis and management of the metabolic syndrome in adults. the metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated risk factors of metabolic origin—metabolic risk factors—that appear to directly promote the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd).1 patients with the metabolic syndrome also are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. another set of conditions, the underlying risk factors, give rise to the metabolic risk factors. in the past few years, several expert groups have attempted to set forth simple diagnostic criteria to be used in clinical practice to identify patients who manifest the multiple components of the metabolic syndrome. these criteria have varied somewhat in specific elements, but in general they include a combination of both underlying and metabolic risk factors. the most widely recognized of the metabolic risk factors are atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and elevated plasma glucose. individuals with these characteristics commonly manifest a prothrombotic state and a proinflammatory state as well. atherogenic dyslipidemia consists of an aggregation of lipoprotein abnormalities including elevated serum triglyceride and apolipoprotein b (apob), increased small ldl particles, and a reduced level of hdl cholesterol (hdl-c). the metabolic syndrome is often referred to as if it were a discrete entity with a single cause. available data suggest that it truly is a syndrome, ie, a grouping of ascvd risk factors, but one that probably has more than one cause. regardless of cause, the syndrome identifies individuals at an elevated risk for ascvd. the magnitude of the increased risk can vary according to which components of the syndrome are present plus the other, non–metabolic syndrome risk factors in a particular person.
binge eating disorder in elderly individuals. binge eating disorder (bed) was introduced in 1994 as a provisional eating disorder diagnosis. the core symptom is recurrent binge eating in the absence of inappropriate compensatory behaviors and/or extreme dietary restraint. this review examines the status of the literature on bed according to five criteria that have been proposed to determine whether bed warrants inclusion in the psychiatric nosology as a distinct eating disorder. we conclude that each of these criteria was met. there is a commonly accepted definition of and assessment approach to bed. the clinical utility and validity of bed have been established, and bed is distinguishable from both bulimia nervosa and obesity. bed should be included in the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
adaptive and scalable load balancing scheme for sort-last parallel volume rendering on gpu clusters hardware-accelerated image composition for sort-last parallel rendering has received increasing attention as an effective solution to increased performance demands brought about by the recent advances in commodity graphics accelerators. so far, several different hardware solutions for alpha and depth compositing have been proposed and a few of them have become commercially available. they share impressive compositing speed and high scalability. however, the cost makes it prohibitively expensive to build a large visualization system. in this paper, we used a hardware image compositor marketed by mitsubishi precision co., ltd. (mpc) which is now available as an independent device enabling the building of our own visualization cluster. this device is based on binary compositing tree architecture, and the scalable cascade interconnection makes it possible to build a large visualization system. however, we focused on a minimal configuration pc cluster using only one compositing device while taking cost into consideration. in order to emulate this cascade interconnection of mpc compositors, we propose and evaluate the hybrid hardware-assisted image composition method which uses the opengl alpha blending capability of the graphics boards for assisting the hardware image composition process. preliminary experiments show that the use of graphics boards diminished the performance degradation when using an emulation based on image feedback through available interconnection network. we found that this proposed method becomes an important alternative for providing high performance image composition at a reasonable cost.
iterated learning framework for unsupervised part-of-speech induction this work presents an algorithm for the unsupervised learning, or induction, of a simple morphology of a natural language. a probabilistic maximum a posteriori model is utilized, which builds hierarchical representations for a set of morphs, which are morpheme-like units discovered from unannotated text corpora. the induced morph lexicon stores parameters related to both the “meaning” and “form” of the morphs it contains. these parameters affect the role of the morphs in words. the model is implemented in a task of unsupervised morpheme segmentation of finnish and english words. very good results are obtained for finnish and almost as good results are obtained in the english task.
modulation of synaptic potentials and cell excitability by dendritic kir and kas channels in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons: a computational study we describe a computational model of the principal cell in the nucleus accumbens (nacb), the medium spiny projection (msp) neuron. the model neuron, constructed in neuron, includes all of the known ionic currents in these cells and receives synaptic input from simulated spike trains via nmda, ampa, and gabaa receptors. after tuning the model by adjusting maximal current conductances in each compartment, the model cell closely matched whole-cell recordings from an adult rat nacb slice preparation. synaptic inputs in the range of 1000-1300 hz are required to maintain an “up” state in the model. cell firing in the model required concurrent depolarization of several dendritic branches, which responded independently to afferent input. depolarization from action potentials traveled to the tips of the dendritic branches and increased ca2+ influx through voltage-gated ca2+ channels. as nmda/ampa current ratios were increased, the membrane showed an increase in hysteresis of “up” and “down” state dwell times, but intrinsic bistability was not observed. the number of oscillatory inputs required to entrain the model cell was determined to be ∼20% of the “up” state inputs. altering the nmda/ampa ratio had a profound effect on processing of afferent input, including the ability to entrain to oscillations in afferent input in the theta range (4-12 hz). these results suggest that afferent information integration by the nacb msp cell may be compromised by pathology in which the nmda current is altered or modulated, as has been proposed in both schizophrenia and addiction.
learning conditional random fields from unaligned data for natural language understanding in this paper, we discuss how discriminative training can be applied to the hidden vector state (hvs) model in different task domains. the hvs model is a discrete hidden markov model (hmm) in which each hmm state represents the state of a push-down automaton with a finite stack size. in previous applications, maximum-likelihood estimation (mle) is used to derive the parameters of the hvs model. however, mle makes a number of assumptions and unfortunately some of these assumptions do not hold. discriminative training, without making such assumptions, can improve the performance of the hvs model by discriminating the correct hypothesis from the competing hypotheses. experiments have been conducted in two domains: the travel domain for the semantic parsing task using the darpa communicator data and the air travel information services (atis) data and the bioinformatics domain for the information extraction task using the genia corpus. the results demonstrate modest improvements of the performance of the hvs model using discriminative training. in the travel domain, discriminative training of the hvs model gives a relative error reduction rate of 31 percent in f-measure when compared with mle on the darpa communicator data and 9 percent on the atis data. in the bioinformatics domain, a relative error reduction rate of 4 percent in f-measure is achieved on the genia corpus.
cost-effectiveness of conventional and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: results of a randomized trial. objectives it has become increasingly common for preference-based measures of health-related quality of life to be used in the evaluation of different health-care interventions. for one such measure, the euroqol, designed to be used for these purposes, it was necessary to derive a single index value for each of the 243 health states it generates. the problem was that it was virtually impossible to generate direct valuations for all of these states, and thus it was necessary to find a procedure that allows the valuations of all euroqol states to be interpolated from direct valuations on a subset of these.   methods in a recent study, direct valuations were elicited for 42 euroqol health states (using the time trade-off method) from a representative sample of the uk population. this article reports on the methodology that was adopted to build up a "tariff" of euroqol values from this data.   results a parsimonious model that fits the data well was defined as one in which valuations were explained in terms of the level of severity associated with each dimension, an intercept associated with any move away from full health, and a term that picked up whether any dimension in the state was at its most severe level.   conclusions the model presented in this article appears to predict the values of the states for which there are direct observations and, thus, can be used to interpolate values for the states for which no direct observations exist.
consultant duration of clinical practice as a cost determinant of an emergency medical admission background deprivation in the general population predicts mortality. we have investigated its relevance to an acute medical admission, using a database of all emergency admissions to st james' hospital, dublin, over a 10-year period (2002-11).   methods all emergency admissions, based on geocoding of residence, were allocated to a small area health research unit division, with a corresponding deprivation index. we then examined this index as a univariate (unadjusted) and independent (adjusted) predictor of 30-day in-hospital mortality.   results the 30-day in-hospital mortality, over the 10-year period, was higher for those in the upper half of the deprivation distribution (9.6 vs. 8.6%; p = 0.002). indeed, there was a stepwise increase in 30-day mortality over the quintiles of deprivation from 7.3% (quintile 1) to 8.8, 10.0, 10.0 and 9.3%, respectively. univariate logistic regression of the deprivation indices (quintiles) against outcome showed an increased risk (p = 0.002) of a 30-day death with odds ratios (ors), respectively (compared with lowest deprivation quintile) of 1.39 [95% confidence intervals (ci) 1.21, 1.58], 1.47 (95% ci 1.29, 1.68), 1.44 (95% ci 1.26, 1.64) and 1.39 (95% ci 1.22, 1.59). the deprivation index was an independent predictor of outcome in a model when adjusted for illness severity and co-morbidity. the fully adjusted or for a 30-day death was increased by 31% (p = 0.001) for patients in the upper half of the deprivation index distribution (or 1.35; 95% ci 1.23, 1.48; p < 0.001).   conclusion deprivation, independent of co-morbidity or acute illness severity, is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in acute medical admissions.
comparison of evidence‐based practice between physicians and nurses: a national survey of regional hospitals in taiwan physicians have to deal with a broad range of medical problems in clinical practice, thus making the timely acquisition of relevant information is a critical skill for physicians to improve care quality. the current national study investigates how physicians search for medical information and analyses how they use online medical databases. a structured questionnaire survey was conducted, with 457 valid returns collected. internet-based resources (web portals, online databases, and electronic journals) were more often accessed by physicians to look for medical information than personal or paper ones. almost universally, physicians have accessed online databases. medline was the most frequently accessed database. furthermore, physicians under 50 years old tended to access online databases more often than their elder colleagues (or = 5.27, 95% ci = 1.96–14.14 for age <35; or = 4.68, 95% ci = 2.07–10.60 for ages 35–50). in addition, physicians with faculty position were more often accessing online databases (or = 3.32; 95% ci = 1.75–6.30). other factors — including clinical experience, administrative position, gender, academic degree, and professional specialty — carried no significant differences. these data may assist in determining how to promote the use of online evidence-based medical information for clinical services.
determining the time period and amount of training data for stock exchange of thailand index prediction this paper proposes the prediction method for stock exchange of thailand index (set index). the proposed method was adapted from [1] by adding more important factors to the prediction function. this research takes into account both external and internal factors to forecast the set index. the external factors are the historical movement of the world's major stock exchange market indices such as dow jones, nikkei and hang seng index, while the internal factors are the historical movement of the set index and minimum loan rate (mlr). the experimental result on both short and long term data show that the proposed method has lower errors for both mean squared error (mse) and mean absolute percentage error (mape) measures. in addition, the proposed function can be put into the spreadsheet which makes it easier and faster for the investors to analyze the trend of stock exchange market.
atypical friedreich ataxia in patients with fxn p.r165p point mutation or comorbid hemochromatosis. measuring the severity of neurologic dysfunction in patients with inherited ataxias, including friedreich ataxia (fa), is difficult because of the variable rate of progression, the variable age at onset and the variety of neural systems that may be affected. the authors discuss the problems related to rating scales in the ataxias, report a neurologic rating scale for fa, and demonstrate acceptable interrater reliability of the instrument.
the interpretation of systematic reviews with meta-analyses: an objective or subjective process? a system has been constructed to evaluate the design, implementation, and analysis of randomized control trials (rct). the degree of quadruple blinding (the randomization process, the physicians and patients as to therapy, and the physicians as to ongoing results) is considered to be the most important aspect of any trial. the analytic techniques are scored with the same emphasis as is placed on the control of bias in the planning and implementation of the studies. description of the patient and treatment materials and the measurement of various controls of quality have less weight. an index of quality of a rct is proposed with its pros and cons. if published papers were to approximate these principles, there would be a marked improvement in the quality of randomized control trials. finally, a reasonable standard design and conduct of trials will facilitate the interpretation of those with conflicting results and help in making valid combinations of undersized trials.
pulsatility and the risk of nonsurgical bleeding in patients supported with the continuous-flow left ventricular assist device heartmate ii background the use of left ventricular assist devices is an accepted therapy for patients with refractory heart failure, but current pulsatile volume-displacement devices have limitations (including large pump size and limited long-term mechanical durability) that have reduced widespread adoption of this technology. continuous-flow pumps are newer types of left ventricular assist devices developed to overcome some of these limitations.   methods in a prospective, multicenter study without a concurrent control group, 133 patients with end-stage heart failure who were on a waiting list for heart transplantation underwent implantation of a continuous-flow pump. the principal outcomes were the proportions of patients who, at 180 days, had undergone transplantation, had cardiac recovery, or had ongoing mechanical support while remaining eligible for transplantation. we also assessed functional status and quality of life.   results the principal outcomes occurred in 100 patients (75%). the median duration of support was 126 days (range, 1 to 600). the survival rate during support was 75% at 6 months and 68% at 12 months. at 3 months, therapy was associated with significant improvement in functional status (according to the new york heart association class and results of a 6-minute walk test) and in quality of life (according to the minnesota living with heart failure and kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaires). major adverse events included postoperative bleeding, stroke, right heart failure, and percutaneous lead infection. pump thrombosis occurred in two patients.   conclusions a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device can provide effective hemodynamic support for a period of at least 6 months in patients awaiting heart transplantation, with improved functional status and quality of life.

short-term effects of unilateral lesion of the primary motor cortex (m1) on ipsilesional hand dexterity in adult macaque monkeys backgroundafter unilateral cervical cord lesion at the c7/c8 border interrupting the dorsolateral funiculus in adult monkeys, neutralization of nogo-a using a specific monoclonal antibody promoted sprouting of corticospinal (cs) axons rostral and caudal to the lesion and, in parallel, improved functional recovery. in monkeys lesioned but not treated with the anti-nogo-a antibody, the cs neurons in the contralesional primary motor cortex (m1) survived to the axotomy, but their soma shrank. because the anti-nogo-a treatment induces regeneration and/or sprouting of cs axons, it may improve access to neurotrophic factors. the question therefore arises as to whether anti-nogo-a treatment prevents the soma shrinkage observed in the contralesional m1?resultsusing the marker smi-32, a quantitative and qualitative anatomical assessment of the pyramidal neurons in the layer v (thus including the cs cells) in m1 was performed and compared across three groups of animals: intact monkeys (n = 5); monkeys subjected to the cervical cord lesion and treated with a control antibody (n = 4); monkeys with the cervical lesion and treated with anti-nogo-a antibody (n = 5). smi-32 positive neurons on the side contralateral to the lesion were generally less well stained than those on the ipsilesional hemisphere, suggesting that they expressed less neurofilaments. nevertheless, in all three groups of monkeys, the amount of smi-32 positive neurons in both hemispheres was generally comparable, confirming the notion that most axotomized cs neurons survived. however, shrinkage of cs cell body area was observed in the contralesional hemisphere in the two groups of lesioned monkeys. the cell surface shrinkage was found to be of the same magnitude in the monkeys treated with the anti-nogo-a antibody as in the control antibody treated monkeys.conclusionthe anti-nogo-a antibody treatment did not preserve the axotomized cs cells from soma shrinkage, indicating that the anti-nogo-a antibody treatment affects morphologically the axotomized cs neurons mainly at distal levels, especially the axon collateralization in the cervical cord, and little or not at all at the level of their soma.
core 1- and core 3-derived o-glycans collectively maintain the colonic mucus barrier and protect against spontaneous colitis in mice abstract for the detection and identification of predominant bacteria in human feces, 16s rrna-gene-targeted group-specific primers for the bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium, the clostridium coccoides group, and prevotella were designed and evaluated. the specificity of these primers was confirmed by using dna extracted from 90 species that are commonly found in the human intestinal microflora. the group-specific primers were then used for identification of 300 isolates from feces of six healthy volunteers. the isolates were clearly identified as 117 isolates of the b. fragilis group, 22 isolates of bifidobacterium, 65 isolates of the c. coccoides group, and 17 isolates of prevotella, indicating that 74% of the isolates were identified with the four pairs of primers. the remaining 79 isolates were identified by 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis and consisted of 40 isolates of collinsella, 24 isolates of the clostridium leptum subgroup, and 15 isolates of disparate clusters. in addition, qualitative detection of these bacterial groups was accomplished without cultivation by using dna extracted from the fecal samples. the goal for this specific pcr technique is to develop a procedure for quantitative detection of these bacterial groups, and a real-time quantitative pcr for detection of bifidobacterium is now being investigated (t. requena, j. burton, t. matsuki, k. munro, m. a. simon, r. tanaka, k. watanabe, and g. w. tannock, appl. environ. microbiol. 68:2420-2427, 2002). therefore, the approaches used to detect and identify predominant bacteria with the group-specific primers described here should contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.
mining super-secondary structure motifs from 3d protein structures: a sequence order independent approach. structure motifs are amino acid packing patterns that occur frequently within a set of protein structures. we define a labeled graph representation of protein structure in which vertices correspond to amino acid residues and edges connect pairs of residues and are labeled by (1) the euclidian distance between the c(alpha) atoms of the two residues and (2) a boolean indicating whether the two residues are in physical/chemical contact. using this representation, a structure motif corresponds to a labeled clique that occurs frequently among the graphs representing the protein structures. the pairwise distance constraints on each edge in a clique serve to limit the variation in geometry among different occurrences of a structure motif. we present an efficient constrained subgraph mining algorithm to discover structure motifs in this setting. compared with contact graph representations, the number of spurious structure motifs is greatly reduced. using this algorithm, structure motifs were located for several scop families including the eukaryotic serine proteases, nuclear binding domains, papain-like cysteine proteases, and fad/nad-linked reductases. for each family, we typically obtain a handful of motifs within seconds of processing time. the occurrences of these motifs throughout the pdb were strongly associated with the original scop family, as measured using a hyper-geometric distribution. the motifs were found to cover functionally important sites like the catalytic triad for serine proteases and co-factor binding sites for nuclear binding domains. the fact that many motifs are highly family-specific can be used to classify new proteins or to provide functional annotation in structural genomics projects.
slow movements of bio-inspired limbs tendon excursions during rotation of individual index finger were recorded continuously throughout the joints' ranges of motion. both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles were studied during flexion--extension and abduction--adduction functions. excursions and joint-displacement relationships were observed to not always be linear. moment arms of tendons with respect to joint centers were further derived from excursion data. the significance of this information to tendon transfer techniques is discussed. these data are also important for theoretical modeling in muscle force determination.
membrane-association determinants of the omega-amino acid monooxygenase pvda, a pyoverdine biosynthetic enzyme from pseudomonas aeruginosa. when escherichia coli cells are converted into spheroplasts by means of ethylenediaminetetraacetate and lysozyme (1)) most of the inducible alkaline phosphatase (2, 3) is released into the surrounding sucrose-tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hcl medium (4, 5), and a large fraction of the “latent” ribonuclease (6-8) and the ribonucleic acid inhibited deoxyribonuclease (9) is also set free (lo).r we have since found that three additional enzymes are liberated: a co tf-stimulated 5’-nucleotidase, not previously described in e. co& an acid phosphatase; and a cyclic phosphodiesterase (11, 12). a total of 10 other enzymes have been examined and found to remain entirely within the spheroplasts. various lines of evidence suggest that the enzymes which are released occur at or near the cell surface. we have also developed a new method for releasing most of these enzymes in high yield without greatly impairing the viability of the cells. the procedure involves osmotic shock. e. coli are first suspended in a concentrated solution of sucrose, which does not penetrate the cells, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate is added. then they are suddenly shifted to a medium of low osmotic strength. this causes the release of the phosphatases and of the cyclic phosphodiesterase in a yield of 70% or more. a preliminary report of this work has appeared (13).
generalized offline orthant search: one code for many problems in multiobjective optimization the non-dominated sorting algorithm by jensen, generalized by fortin et al to handle the cases of equal objective values, has the running time complexity of o(n log k − 1 n) in the general case. here n is the number of points, k is the number of objectives and k is thought to be a constant when n varies. however, the complexity was not proven to be the same in the worst case.
effect of wear on stress distributions and potential fracture in teeth tooth enamel is inherently weak, with fracture toughness comparable with glass, yet it is remarkably resilient, surviving millions of functional contacts over a lifetime. we propose a microstructural mechanism of damage resistance, based on observations from ex situ loading of human and sea otter molars (teeth with strikingly similar structural features). section views of the enamel implicate tufts, hypomineralized crack-like defects at the enamel–dentin junction, as primary fracture sources. we report a stabilization in the evolution of these defects, by “stress shielding” from neighbors, by inhibition of ensuing crack extension from prism interweaving (decussation), and by self-healing. these factors, coupled with the capacity of the tooth configuration to limit the generation of tensile stresses in largely compressive biting, explain how teeth may absorb considerable damage over time without catastrophic failure, an outcome with strong implications concerning the adaptation of animal species to diet.
design of a map-based transit itinerary planner for courses in human-computer interaction. the sixth edition of designing the user interface provides a comprehensive, authoritative, and up-to-date introduction to the dynamic field of human-computer interaction (hci) and user experience (ux) design. this classic book has defined and charted the astonishing evolution of user interfaces for three decades. students and professionals learn practical principles and guidelines needed to develop high quality interface designs that users can understand, predict, and control. the book covers theoretical foundations and design processes such as expert reviews and usability testing. by presenting current research andinnovations in human-computer interaction, the authors strive toinspire students, guide designers, and provoke researchers to seek solutions that improve the experiences of novice and expert users, while achieving universal usability. the authors also provide balanced presentations on controversial topics such as augmented and virtual reality, voice and natural language interfaces, and information visualization. updates include current hci design methods, new design examples, and totally revamped coverage of social media, search and voice interaction. major revisions were made toevery chapter, changing almost every figure (170 new color figures) and substantially updating the references.
structure-based function prediction of uncharacterized protein using binding sites comparison a new web portal for the charmm macromolecular modeling package, charmming (charmm interface and graphics, http://www.charmming.org), is presented. this tool provides a user-friendly interface for the preparation, submission, monitoring, and visualization of molecular simulations (i.e., energy minimization, solvation, and dynamics). the infrastructure used to implement the web application is described. two additional programs have been developed and integrated with charmming: genrtf, which is employed to define structural features not supported by the standard charmm force field, and a job broker, which is used to provide a portable method for using grid and cluster computing with charmming. the use of the program is described with three proteins: 1yjp , 1o1o , and 1ufy . source code is provided allowing charmming to be downloaded, installed, and used by supercomputing centers and research groups that have a charmm license. although no software can replace a scientist's own judgment and experience, charmming eases the introduction of newcomers to the molecular modeling discipline by providing a graphical method for running simulations.
ancestral reproductive structure in basal kelp aureophycus aleuticus an approximately unbiased (au) test that uses a newly devised multiscale bootstrap technique was developed for general hypothesis testing of regions in an attempt to reduce test bias. it was applied to maximum-likelihood tree selection for obtaining the confidence set of trees. the au test is based on the theory of efron et al. (proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 93:13429-13434; 1996), but the new method provides higher-order accuracy yet simpler implementation. the au test, like the shimodaira-hasegawa (sh) test, adjusts the selection bias overlooked in the standard use of the bootstrap probability and kishino-hasegawa tests. the selection bias comes from comparing many trees at the same time and often leads to overconfidence in the wrong trees. the sh test, though safe to use, may exhibit another type of bias such that it appears conservative. here i show that the au test is less biased than other methods in typical cases of tree selection. these points are illustrated in a simulation study as well as in the analysis of mammalian mitochondrial protein sequences. the theoretical argument provides a simple formula that covers the bootstrap probability test, the kishino-hasegawa test, the au test, and the zharkikh-li test. a practical suggestion is provided as to which test should be used under particular circumstances.
nonlinear programming without a penalty function in this paper we present a filter algorithm for nonlinear programming and prove its global convergence to stationary points. each iteration is composed of a feasibility phase, which reduces a measure of infeasibility, and an optimality phase, which reduces the objective function in a tangential approximation of the feasible set. these two phases are totally independent, and the only coupling between them is provided by the filter. the method is independent of the internal algorithms used in each iteration, as long as these algorithms satisfy reasonable assumptions on their efficiency. under standard hypotheses, we show two results: for a filter with minimum size, the algorithm generates a stationary accumulation point; for a slightly larger filter, all accumulation points are stationary.
resident fibroblast lineages mediate pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis. understanding the origins and roles of cardiac progenitor cells is important for elucidating the pathogenesis of congenital and acquired heart diseases. moreover, manipulation of cardiac myocyte progenitors has potential for cell-based repair strategies for various myocardial disorders. here we report the identification in mouse of a previously unknown cardiac myocyte lineage that derives from the proepicardial organ. these progenitor cells, which express the t-box transcription factor tbx18, migrate onto the outer cardiac surface to form the epicardium, and then make a substantial contribution to myocytes in the ventricular septum and the atrial and ventricular walls. tbx18-expressing cardiac progenitors also give rise to cardiac fibroblasts and coronary smooth muscle cells. the pluripotency of tbx18 proepicardial cells provides a theoretical framework for applying these progenitors to effect cardiac repair and regeneration.
prevalence of hcm and long qt syndrome mutations in young sudden cardiac death-related cases the long qt syndrome (lqts) is a genetic disorder, typically characterized by a prolonged qt interval in the ecg due to abnormal cardiac repolarization. lqts may lead to syncopal episodes and sudden cardiac death. various parameters based on t-wave morphology, as well as the qt interval itself have been shown to be useful discriminators, but no single ecg parameter has been sufficient to solve the diagnostic problem. in this study we present a method for discrimination among persons with a normal genotype and those with mutations in the kcnq1 (kvlqt1 or lqt1) and kcnh2 (herg or lqt2) genes on the basis of parameters describing t-wave morphology in terms of duration, asymmetry, flatness and amplitude. discriminant analyses based on 4 or 5 parameters both resulted in perfect discrimination in a learning set of 36 subjects. in both cases cross-validation of the resulting classifiers showed no misclassifications either.
evidence for therapeutic intervention in the prevention of cerebral palsy: hope from animal model research. the objective of this paper is to (1) identify from the literature a potential critical period for the maturation of the corticospinal tract (cst) and (2) report pilot data on an intensive, activity-based therapy applied during this period, in children with lesions to the cst. the best estimate of the cst critical period for the legs is when the child is younger than 2 years of age. previous interventions for walking in children with cst damage were mainly applied after this age. our preliminary results with training children younger than 2 years showed improvements in walking that exceeded all previous reports. further, we refined techniques for measuring motor and sensory pathways to and from the legs, so that changes can be measured at this young age. previous activity-based therapies may have been applied too late in development. a randomized controlled trial is now underway to determine if intensive leg therapy improves the outcome of children with early stroke.
efficacy of serum procalcitonin to predict spontaneous preterm birth in women with threatened preterm labour: a prospective observational study abstract the purpose of this study was to evaluate procalcitonin (pct) plasma levels in pregnancy complicated by preterm labor and to determine their value in the prediction of preterm delivery and the length of the admission-to-delivery interval. the study population consisted of 53 patients with preterm labor and 31 healthy pregnants. the study patients were divided according to the delivery time and to the admission-to-delivery interval. plasma pct concentrations were higher in preterm labor than in healthy pregnants. although at the onset of preterm labor plasma pct concentrations in patients who delivered prematurely were higher than in patients who, after tocolytic treatment, delivered at term, the difference was not significant. also in cases of preterm labor delivered within and after three and seven days of admission no differences were observed. the highest values in the prediction of preterm delivery and the length of admission- to-delivery interval corresponded to a pct concentration of 1.7 ng/ml. these findings suggest that although preterm labor is associated with increased pct concentrations in maternal plasma, there is no significant association either between plasma concentration of pct at the moment of threat and preterm delivery, or the admission- to-delivery interval. the predictive value of plasma pct determinations is unsatisfactory.
modelling the effect of beliefs about asthma medication and treatment intrusiveness on adherence and preference for once-daily vs. twice-daily medication background the development of the asthma control test (act), a short, simple, patient-based tool for identifying patients with poorly controlled asthma, was recently described in patients under the routine care of an asthma specialist.   objectives we sought to evaluate the reliability and validity of the act in a longitudinal study of asthmatic patients new to the care of an asthma specialist.   methods patients (n=313) completed the act and the asthma control questionnaire (acq) at 2 physician visits (4-12 weeks apart). pulmonary function was measured, and asthma specialists rated asthma control.   results internal consistency reliability of the act was 0.85 (baseline) and 0.79 (follow-up). test-retest reliability was 0.77. criterion validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between baseline act scores and baseline specialists' ratings of asthma control (r=0.52, p<.001) and acq scores (r=-0.89, p<.001). discriminant validity was demonstrated, with significant (p<.001) differences in mean act scores across patients differing in asthma control, pulmonary function, and treatment recommendation. responsiveness of the act to changes in asthma control and lung function was demonstrated with significant correlations between changes in act scores and changes in specialists' ratings (r=0.44, p<.001), acq scores (r=-0.69, p<.001), and percent predicted fev1 values (r=0.29, p<.001). an act score of 19 or less provided optimum balance of sensitivity (71%) and specificity (71%) for detecting uncontrolled asthma.   conclusions the act is reliable, valid, and responsive to changes in asthma control over time in patients new to the care of asthma specialists. a cutoff score of 19 or less identifies patients with poorly controlled asthma.   clinical implications in a clinical setting the act should be a useful tool to help physicians identify patients with uncontrolled asthma and facilitate their ability to follow patients' progress with treatment.
nanog induced intermediate state in regulating stem cell differentiation and reprogramming an adaptive minimum action method is proposed for computing the most probable transition paths between stable equilibria in metastable systems that do not necessarily have an underlying energy function, by minimizing the action functional associated with such transition paths. this new algorithm uses the moving mesh strategy to adaptively adjust the grid points over the time interval of transition. numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the adaptive minimum action method.
early restriction of alphavirus replication and dissemination contributes to age-dependent attenuation of systemic hyperinflammatory disease. a comparative pathogenesis study was performed in neonatal mice using a molecularly cloned laboratory variant of sindbis strain ar339, designated trsb, and a single-site attenuated mutant of trsb derived by site-directed mutagenesis of the e2 glycoprotein from ser to arg at residue 114 (trsbr114). trsb caused 100% mortality with an average survival time of 3.0 +/- 0.7 days, whereas mice inoculated with trsbr114 exhibited an attenuated disease course with 46% mortality and an extended average survival time of 7.5 +/- 3.4 days for those animals that died. reduced virulence of trsbr114 was characterized by delayed appearance of detectable virus, relative to trsb, and by lower peak virus titers in both sera and brains of infected mice. trsb infection induced very high peak serum titers of interferon alpha/beta (215,000 units/ml compared to 2100 units/ml for trsbr114). in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated replication of trsb in brain, but only minimal histopathological changes and no evidence of encephalitis were observed. however, extensive extraneural lesions and viral replication were found in skin, connective tissue, and muscle. moreover, dramatic involution of the thymus and loss of hematopoietic tissues were observed in the absence of virus replication at these sites, suggesting the involvement of a systemic physiological stress response in trsb infection. trsbr114 infection did not cause thymic lesions. otherwise, the attenuated mutant demonstrated a similar pattern of tissue and organ involvement, but lesions and positive in situ hybridization signal were much more limited in scope and intensity compared to trsb. trsbr114-infected mice developed myositis and encephalomyelitis approximately 6 days postinfection. therefore, trsb-infected animals may succumb to an early syndrome associated with the stress response, preventing their survival for a time sufficient for the development of encephalitis. alternatively, a systemic stress response, as evidenced by thymic involution, may result in immunosuppression, thus contributing to the absence of encephalitis. in any event, the attenuating mutation in the e2 glycoprotein significantly altered the course of sindbis-induced disease by limiting virus replication and associated damage early in infection. mutant-infected animals survived beyond day 4 and progressed to a classical encephalomyelitis from which about half recovered.
time-varying spectral analysis of heart rate and left ventricular pressure variability during balloon coronary occlusion in humans: a sympathoexicitatory response to myocardial ischemia. multiresolution representations are effective for analyzing the information content of images. the properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. it is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of l/sup 2/(r/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. in l/sup 2/(r), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). this decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. it is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. wavelet representation lies between the spatial and fourier domains. for images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. the application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >
regional fractionation and dominant frequency in persistent atrial fibrillation: effects of left atrial ablation and evidence of spatial relationship. background temporal variation in complex fractionated atrial electrograms (cfaes) exists during atrial fibrillation (af).   objective this study sought to quantify the variation in cfaes using a fractionation interval (fi) algorithm and to define the shortest optimal recording duration required to consistently characterize the magnitude of the fractionation.   methods twenty-seven patients undergoing af mapping in the left atrium were studied. the fi and frequency analysis were performed at each mapped site for recording durations of 1 to 8 seconds. the magnitude of the fractionation was quantified by the fi algorithm, which calculated the mean interval between multiple, discrete deflections during af. the results from each duration were statistically compared with the maximal-duration recording, as a standard. the fi values were compared with the dominant frequency values obtained from the associated frequency spectra.   results the fis obtained from recording durations between 5 and 8 seconds had a smaller variation in the fi (p < .05) and, for those sites with a fi < 50 ms, the fractionation was typically continuous. the fast-fourier transform spectra obtained from the cfae sites with recording durations of >5 seconds harbored higher dominant frequency values than those with shorter recording durations (8.1 +/- 2.5 hz vs. 6.8 +/- 0.98 hz, p < .05). the cfae sites with continuous fractionation were located within the pulmonary veins and their ostia in 77% of patients with paroxysmal af, and in only 29% of patients with nonparoxysmal af (p < .05).   conclusion the assessment of fractionated electrograms requires a recording duration of > or =5 seconds at each site to obtain a consistent fractionation. sites with the shortest fis consistently identified sites with the fastest electrogram activity throughout the entire left atrium and pulmonary veins.
serum-deprivation stimulates cap-binding by parn at the expense of eif4e, consistent with the observed decrease in mrna stability cap-dependent translation is mediated by eif4f, a protein complex composed of three subunits as follows: eif4e, which recognizes the mrna 5' cap structure; eif4a, an rna-helicase; and eif4g, a scaffolding protein that binds eif4e, eif4a, and the eif4e-kinase mnk1 simultaneously. eif4e is hypophosphorylated and cap-dependent translation is reduced at mitosis. here, we show that 4e-bp1, a suppressor of eif4e function, is also hypophosphorylated in mitosis, resulting in disruption of the eif4f complex. consequently, eif4e is sequestered from the eif4g/mnk1 complex. these results explain the specific inhibition of cap-dependent translation in mitosis and also explain how eif4e is rendered hypophosphorylated during mitosis. furthermore, eif4e interaction with eif4gii is strongly decreased coincident with hyperphosphorylation of eif4gii. thus, inhibition of cap-dependent translation in mitosis results from a combination of phosphorylation modifications leading to eif4f complex disruption.
fatty acids acutely enhance insulin-induced oxidative stress and cause insulin resistance by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ros) generation and nuclear factor-κb inhibitor (iκb)–nuclear factor-κb (nfκb) activation in rat muscle, in the absence of mitochondrial dysfunction we previously showed that insulin has a profound effect to suppress pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (pdk) 4 expression in rat skeletal muscle. in the present study, we examined whether insulin’s effect on pdk4 expression is impaired in acute insulin-resistant states and, if so, whether this change is accompanied by decreased insulin’s effects to stimulate akt and forkhead box class o (foxo) 1 phosphorylation. to induce insulin resistance, conscious overnight-fasted rats received a constant infusion of intralipid or lactate for 5 h, while a control group received saline infusion. following the initial infusions, each group received saline or insulin infusion (n = 6 or 7 each) for an additional 5 h, while saline, intralipid, or lactate infusion was continued. plasma glucose was clamped at basal levels during the insulin infusion. compared with the control group, intralipid and lactate infusions decreased glucose infusion rates required to clamp plasma glucose by ∼60% (p < 0.01), confirming the induction of insulin resistance. insulin’s ability to suppress pdk4 mrna level was impaired in skeletal muscle with intralipid and lactate infusions, resulting in two- to threefold higher pdk4 mrna levels with insulin (p < 0.05). insulin stimulation of akt and foxo1 phosphorylation was also significantly decreased with intralipid and lactate infusions. these data suggest that insulin’s effect to suppress pdk4 gene expression in skeletal muscle is impaired in insulin-resistant states, and this may be due to impaired insulin signaling for stimulation of akt and foxo1 phosphorylation. impaired insulin’s effect to suppress pdk4 expression may explain the association between pdk4 overexpression and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
approximate modified policy iteration and its application to the game of tetris for playing the game of tetris well, training a controller by the cross-entropy method seems to be a viable way (szita and lȍrincz, 2006; thiery and scherrer, 2009). we consider this method to tune an evaluation-based one-piece controller as suggested by szita and lȍrincz and we introduce some improvements. in this context, we discuss the influence of the noise, and we perform experiments with several sets of features such as those introduced by bertsekas and tsitsiklis (1996), by dellacherie (fahey, 2003), and some original features. this approach leads to a controller that outperforms the previous known results. on the original game of tetris, we show that with probability 0.95 it achieves at least 910, 000 ± 5% lines per game on average. on a simplified version of tetris considered by most research works, it achieves 35, 000, 000 ± 20% lines per game on average. we used this approach when we took part with the program bcts in the 2008 tetris domain reinforcement learning competition and won the competition.
community treatment orders: the experiences of non-maori and maori within mainstream and maori mental health services objective the goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of involuntary outpatient commitment in reducing rehospitalizations among individuals with severe mental illnesses.   method subjects who were hospitalized involuntarily were randomly assigned to be released (n = 135) or to continue under outpatient commitment (n = 129) after hospital discharge and followed for 1 year. each subject received case management services plus additional outpatient treatment. outpatient treatment and hospital use data were collected.   results in bivariate analyses, the control and outpatient commitment groups did not differ significantly in hospital outcomes. however, subjects who underwent sustained periods of outpatient commitment beyond that of the initial court order had approximately 57% fewer readmissions and 20 fewer hospital days than control subjects. sustained outpatient commitment was shown to be particularly effective for individuals with nonaffective psychotic disorders, reducing hospital readmissions approximately 72% and requiring 28 fewer hospital days. in repeated measures multivariable analyses, the outpatient commitment group had significantly better hospital outcomes, even without considering the total length of court-ordered outpatient commitments. however, in subsequent repeated measures analyses examining the role of outpatient treatment among psychotically disordered individuals, it was also found that sustained outpatient commitment reduced hospital readmissions only when combined with a higher intensity of outpatient treatment.   conclusions outpatient commitment can work to reduce hospital readmissions and total hospital days when court orders are sustained and combined with intensive treatment, particularly for individuals with psychotic disorders. this use of outpatient commitment is not a substitute for intensive treatment; it requires a substantial commitment of treatment resources to be effective.
hybrid nanotrimers for dual t1 and t2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging colloidal hybrid nanoparticles contain multiple nanoscale domains fused together by solid-state interfaces. they represent an emerging class of multifunctional lab-on-a-particle architectures that underpin future advances in solar energy conversion, fuel-cell catalysis, medical imaging and therapy, and electronics. the complexity of these 'artificial molecules' is limited ultimately by the lack of a mechanism-driven design framework. here, we show that known chemical reactions can be applied in a predictable and stepwise manner to build complex hybrid nanoparticle architectures that include m-pt-fe(3)o(4) (m = au, ag, ni, pd) heterotrimers, m(x)s-au-pt-fe(3)o(4) (m = pb, cu) heterotetramers and higher-order oligomers based on the heterotrimeric au-pt-fe(3)o(4) building block. this synthetic framework conceptually mimics the total-synthesis approach used by chemists to construct complex organic molecules. the reaction toolkit applies solid-state nanoparticle analogues of chemoselective reactions, regiospecificity, coupling reactions and molecular substituent effects to the construction of exceptionally complex hybrid nanoparticle oligomers.
dehydroalanine-containing peptides: preparation from phenylselenocysteine and utility in convergent ligation strategies selenocysteine (sec or u) is often referred to as the 21st natural amino acid because it is found in a number of naturally occurring enzymes in archaea, eubacteria, and eukarya. sec is inserted cotranslationally into these proteins and has its own trna that recognizes the opal stop codon uga. both cis (intramolecular) elements and trans (intermolecular) acting factors are instrumental in decoding uga for sec insertion rather than aborting translation. in bacteria, a stem-loop structure in the mrna immediately downstream of the uga codon (the selenocysteine insertion sequence, secis) is recognized by a specialized selenocysteine elongation factor (selb, figure 1a). the quaternary complex of selb, sec ± trna, guanosine triphosphate (gtp), and the secis is then directed to the a site of the ribosome for sec incorporation opposite the uga codon.
persistence of associations between cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction in the early phase of parkinson’s disease the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders is difficult, especially early in the course of the diseases. the clinical subtypes of parkinson's disease (pd) have not so far been described in newly diagnosed patients. we present a prospective incidence cohort study of patients with idiopathic parkinsonian syndromes in the umeå region in northern sweden identified over a 4‐year period. the clinical diagnoses were re‐evaluated at follow‐up visits at 12 months. we found 138 patients with parkinsonism: 112 pd, 12 multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (msa‐p), six progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) and eight unclassifiable patients. the crude incidences for all age ranges per 100,000 were: pd 19.7 (95% confidence interval 16.1–23.3); msa‐p 2.1 (1.1–3.7); psp 1.1 (0.4–2.4); idiopathic parkinsonism 24.3 (20.2–28.4). age‐standardized to the average swedish population 2004–2007: pd 22.5 (18.3–26.7); msa‐p 2.4 (1.2–4.2); psp 1.2 (0.4–2.6); idiopathic parkinsonism 27.5 (22.9–32.1). the crude annual incidence rate for pd, with exclusion of patients with normal dopamine receptor uptake (fp‐cit‐spect), was 18.8 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 15.2–22.4), age‐adjusted to the average swedish population 2004 to 2007: 21.5 (17.4–25.6). the incidence rates did not differ significantly between men and women. the cumulative incidence of pd up to 89 years of age was for men 3.4%, for women 2.6%, and for both sexes combined 2.9%. the annual incidence rates found for pd, idiopathic parkinsonism, msa‐p and psp are among the highest reported. © 2010 movement disorder society
the butterfly fauna of wisconsin bogs: lessons for conservation transect surveys of adult butterflies were conducted along fixed routes at 27 study sites grouped into three subregions of tallgrass prairie and one subregion of pine-oak barrens in the midwestern usa. within subregion, each site was visited the same number of times over 5–7 years on similar dates with similar weather. for each site, five indices of species richness and/or abundance were calculated both for total butterflies and for specialist species primarily restricted to native herbaceous vegetation. these indices were then analysed as to how much they agreed or conflicted in site ranking and how site rankings based on total butterflies compared to those based on specialists. variation in site ranking by different indices was relatively low. mean site rank by specialist indices covaried significantly with mean site rank by indices for total butterflies. numerous studies have shown that on a regional scale, areas of higher richness for all species in a taxonomic group are different habitat types (based on amount of canopy or degree of degradation) from “hotspots” for that taxon's subset of species of conservation concern (endemics or specialists). but in this study, within a habitat type, site rankings based on total butterflies significantly tended to agree with site rankings based on specialist butterflies. this suggests that site prioritization and management favouring specialist butterflies would also favour the overall butterfly fauna possible in the same habitat.
computational identification of novel stage-specific biomarkers in colorectal cancer progression motivation the first step for clinical diagnostics, prognostics and targeted therapeutics of cancer is to comprehensively understand its molecular mechanisms. large-scale cancer genomics projects are providing a large volume of data about genomic, epigenomic and gene expression aberrations in multiple cancer types. one of the remaining challenges is to identify driver mutations, driver genes and driver pathways promoting cancer proliferation and filter out the unfunctional and passenger ones.   results in this study, we propose two methods to solve the so-called maximum weight submatrix problem, which is designed to de novo identify mutated driver pathways from mutation data in cancer. the first one is an exact method that can be helpful for assessing other approximate or/and heuristic algorithms. the second one is a stochastic and flexible method that can be employed to incorporate other types of information to improve the first method. particularly, we propose an integrative model to combine mutation and expression data. we first apply our methods onto simulated data to show their efficiency. we further apply the proposed methods onto several real biological datasets, such as the mutation profiles of 74 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas samples, 90 glioblastoma tumor samples and 313 ovarian carcinoma samples. the gene expression profiles were also considered for the later two data. the results show that our integrative model can identify more biologically relevant gene sets. we have implemented all these methods and made a package called mutated driver pathway finder, which can be easily used for other researchers.   availability a matlab package of mdpfinder is available at http://zhangroup.aporc.org/shihuazhang.   contact zsh@amss.ac.cn.   supplementary information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
content-based image annotation refinement the development of technology generates huge amounts of non-textual information, such as images. an efficient image annotation and retrieval system is highly desired. clustering algorithms make it possible to represent visual features of images with finite symbols. based on this, many statistical models, which analyze correspondence between visual features and words and discover hidden semantics, have been published. these models improve the annotation and retrieval of large image databases. however, current state of the art including our previous work produces too many irrelevant keywords for images during annotation. in this paper, we propose a novel approach that augments the classical model with generic knowledge-based, wordnet. our novel approach strives to prune irrelevant keywords by the usage of wordnet. to identify irrelevant keywords, we investigate various semantic similarity measures between keywords and finally fuse outcomes of all these measures together to make a final decision using dempster-shafer evidence combination. we have implemented various models to link visual tokens with keywords based on knowledge-based, wordnet and evaluated performance using precision, and recall using benchmark dataset. the results show that by augmenting knowledge-based with classical model we can improve annotation accuracy by removing irrelevant keywords.

a continuous smooth map of space in the primary visual cortex of the common marmoset we examined the retinotopic mapping of the visual world in the primary visual cortex of the marmoset monkey using differential optical imaging. two sets of complementary stripe-like locations were visually stimulated in turn. their difference depicts the cortical representations of continuous bands of visual space. by rotating the sets of stripe-like locations it is possible to map different spatial axes. analogous to the macaque we found that the v1/v2 border represented the vertical meridian, while horizontal, 45-, and 135-degree angled stripes of space were also represented in a continuous manner. we developed a new automatic method of calculating local measures of cortical magnification from our optical retinotopic maps. using this method we found no evidence of any local anisotropies in cortical representation. overall our results indicate that space is mapped isotropically in the primary visual cortex of the common marmoset.
neural correlates (erp/fmri) of voluntary selection in adult adhd patients fmri and eeg are complimentary methods for the analysis of brain activity since each method has its strength where the other one has limits: the spatial resolution is thus in the range of millimeters with fmri and the time resolution is in the range of milliseconds with eeg. for a comprehensive understanding of brain activity in target detection, nine healthy subjects (age 24.2 +/- 2.9) were investigated with simultaneous eeg (27 electrodes) and fmri using an auditory oddball paradigm. as a first step, event-related potentials, measured inside the scanner, have been compared with the potentials recorded in a directly preceding session in front of the scanner. attenuated amplitudes were found inside the scanner for the earlier n1/p2 component but not for the late p300 component. second, an independent analysis of the localizations of the fmri activations and the current source density as revealed by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (loreta) has been done. concordant activations were found in most regions, including the temporoparietal junction (tpj), the supplementary motor area (sma)/anterior cingulate cortex (acc), the insula, and the middle frontal gyrus, with a mean euclidean distance of 16.0 +/- 6.6 mm between the bold centers of gravity and the loreta-maxima. finally, a time-course analysis based on the current source density maxima was done. it revealed different time-course patterns in the left and right hemisphere with earlier activations in frontal and parietal regions in the right hemisphere. the results suggest that the combination of eeg and fmri permits an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity.
quantitative assessment of brain microvascular and tissue oxygenation during cardiac arrest and resuscitation in pigs we are developing a robust, minimally invasive device for detecting progression toward hemorrhagic shock in trauma patients. to accomplish this, oxygen micro-sensors are being developed that contain a solution of oxygen-sensitive phosphorescent probes within gas permeable tubing attached to optical fibers. these micro-sensors can be inserted into peripheral tissue to accurately measure tissue oxygenation. as the blood volume decreases (hemorrhage), physiological mechanisms progressively restrict blood flow to “non essential” peripheral tissues, redirecting that flow to the essential internal organs. it is hypothesized that the sensors will detect the shutdown of peripheral blood flow well before the decreasing blood volume reaches the threshold where multi-organ failure begins. proactive treatment with volume expanders or blood, guided by peripheral oxygen measurements, would significantly reduce multi-organ failure and other complications in trauma cases.
sequence variations of grm6 in patients with high myopia single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) constitute the bulk of human genetic variation, occurring with an average density of approximately 1/1000 nucleotides of a genotype. snps are either neutral allelic variants or are under selection of various strengths, and the impact of snps on fitness remains unknown. identification of snps affecting human phenotype, especially leading to risks of complex disorders, is one of the key problems of medical genetics. snps in protein-coding regions that cause amino acid variants (non-synonymous csnps) are most likely to affect phenotypes. we have developed a straightforward and reliable method based on physical and comparative considerations that estimates the impact of an amino acid replacement on the three-dimensional structure and function of the protein. we estimate that approximately 20% of common human non-synonymous snps damage the protein. the average minor allele frequency of such snps in our data set was two times lower than that of benign non-synonymous snps. the average human genotype carries approximately 10(3) damaging non-synonymous snps that together cause a substantial reduction in fitness.
parallel wavelet tree construction this announcement describes the problem based benchmark suite (pbbs). pbbs is a set of benchmarks designed for comparing parallel algorithmic approaches, parallel programming language styles, and machine architectures across a broad set of problems. each benchmark is defined concretely in terms of a problem specification and a set of input distributions. no requirements are made in terms of algorithmic approach, programming language, or machine architecture. the goal of the benchmarks is not only to compare runtimes, but also to be able to compare code and other aspects of an implementation (e.g., portability, robustness, determinism, and generality). as such the code for an implementation of a benchmark is as important as its runtime, and the public pbbs repository will include both code and performance results.  the benchmarks are designed to make it easy for others to try their own implementations, or to add new benchmark problems. each benchmark problem includes the problem specification, the specification of input and output file formats, default input generators, test codes that check the correctness of the output for a given input, driver code that can be linked with implementations, a baseline sequential implementation, a baseline multicore implementation, and scripts for running timings (and checks) and outputting the results in a standard format. the current suite includes the following problems: integer sort, comparison sort, remove duplicates, dictionary, breadth first search, spanning forest, minimum spanning forest, maximal independent set, maximal matching, k-nearest neighbors, delaunay triangulation, convex hull, suffix arrays, n-body, and ray casting. for each problem, we report the performance of our baseline multicore implementation on a 40-core machine.
approximate modified policy iteration and its application to the game of tetris for playing the game of tetris well, training a controller by the cross-entropy method seems to be a viable way (szita and lȍrincz, 2006; thiery and scherrer, 2009). we consider this method to tune an evaluation-based one-piece controller as suggested by szita and lȍrincz and we introduce some improvements. in this context, we discuss the influence of the noise, and we perform experiments with several sets of features such as those introduced by bertsekas and tsitsiklis (1996), by dellacherie (fahey, 2003), and some original features. this approach leads to a controller that outperforms the previous known results. on the original game of tetris, we show that with probability 0.95 it achieves at least 910, 000 ± 5% lines per game on average. on a simplified version of tetris considered by most research works, it achieves 35, 000, 000 ± 20% lines per game on average. we used this approach when we took part with the program bcts in the 2008 tetris domain reinforcement learning competition and won the competition.
theory of mind and pragmatic understanding following right hemisphere damage the ability to interpret conversational utterances was assessed in a group of 12 male patients with unilateral right hemisphere brain damage (rhd) and 12 non-brain-damaged, age-matched male control subjects. subjects listened to short vignettes which described both the affective tone of the relationship between a speaker and an actor, and the actor's performance on a task. each vignette concluded with the speaker characterizing the actor's performance. in half of the items, the speaker's utterance was literally true; in the other half, the utterance was literally false and invited a nonliteral interpretation. results showed no appreciable differences in the performance of control subjects and rhd patients when interpreting literally true utterances. in contrast, the two groups differed reliably when interpreting the pragmatic intent of nonliteral utterances: control subjects used information about both the actor's performance and the speaker-actor relationship, while rhd patients demonstrated difficulty in using the information about the speaker-actor relationship. results have implications for patients' understanding of essential elements of conversations, such as characters' internal states and their intentions in employing different forms of literal and nonliteral language.
heterologous expression of alteromonas macleodii and thiocapsa roseopersicina [nife] hydrogenases in escherichia coli. we describe an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping dna molecules by the concerted action of a 5′ exonuclease, a dna polymerase and a dna ligase. first we recessed dna fragments, yielding single-stranded dna overhangs that specifically annealed, and then covalently joined them. this assembly method can be used to seamlessly construct synthetic and natural genes, genetic pathways and entire genomes, and could be a useful molecular engineering tool.
structure regularized unsupervised discriminant feature analysis in supervised learning scenarios, feature selection has been studied widely in the literature. selecting features in unsupervised learning scenarios is a much harder problem, due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. and, almost all of previous unsupervised feature selection methods are "wrapper" techniques that require a learning algorithm to evaluate the candidate feature subsets. in this paper, we propose a "filter" method for feature selection which is independent of any learning algorithm. our method can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised fashion. the proposed method is based on the observation that, in many real world classification problems, data from the same class are often close to each other. the importance of a feature is evaluated by its power of locality preserving, or, laplacian score. we compare our method with data variance (unsupervised) and fisher score (supervised) on two data sets. experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
case, word order, and language learnability: insights from connectionist modeling abstract we propose that children construct a canonical sentence schema as a preliminary organizing structure for language behavior. the canonical sentence embodies the typical features of complete clauses in the input language, and serves as a framework for the application of productive and perceptual strategies. the canonical sentence schema offers a functional explanation of word-order and inflectional strategies based on the child's attempts to quickly master basic communication skills in his or her language. the present research explores sensitivity to the canonical sentence form and to word-order and inflectional perceptual strategies for comprehending simple transitive sentences in monolingual children aged 2;0 to 4;4 in four languages: english (ordered, uninflectional), italian (weakly ordered, weakly inflectional), serbo-croatian (weakly ordered, inflectional), turkish (minimally ordered, inflectional). the results show that children fail to respond systematically to sequences that violate the canonical sentence form of their particular language. they develop distinct word-order and inflectional strategies appropriate to the regularities of their language. the early behavioral emergence of linguistically appropriate canonical sentences and processing strategies suggests a behavioral foundation for linguistic constraints on the surface form of sentences.
does the director election system matter? evidence from majority voting this paper presents a parameter covariance matrix estimator which is consistent even when the disturbances of a linear regression model are heteroskedastic. this estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity. by comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. the test has an appealing least squares interpretation.
application of photoluminescent measurement techniques for quantitative assessment of turbine film cooling structural features resulting from the interaction of a turbulent jet issuing transversely into a uniform stream are described with the help of flow visualization and hot-wire anemometry. jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios from 2 to 10 were investigated at crossflow reynolds numbers from 3800 to 11400. in particular, the origin and formation of the vortices in the wake are described and shown to be fundamentally different from the well-known phenomenon of vortex shedding from solid bluff bodies. the flow around a transverse jet does not separate from the jet and does not shed vorticity into the wake. instead, the wake vortices have their origins in the laminar boundary layer of the wall from which the jet issues. it is argued that the closed flow around the jet imposes an adverse pressure gradient on the wall, on the downstream lateral sides of the jet, provoking 'separation events’ in the wall boundary layer on each side. these result in eruptions of boundary-layer fluid and formation of wake vortices that are convected downstream. the measured wake strouhal frequencies, which depend on the jet-crossflow velocity ratio, match the measured frequencies of the separation events. the wake structure is most orderly and the corresponding wake strouhal number (0.13) is most sharply defined for velocity ratios near the value 4. measured wake profiles show deficits of both momentum and total pressure.
the association between parameters of malnutrition and diagnostic measures of sarcopenia in geriatric outpatients background a short battery of physical performance tests was used to assess lower extremity function in more than 5,000 persons age 71 years and older in three communities.   methods balance, gait, strength, and endurance were evaluated by examining ability to stand with the feet together in the side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem positions, time to walk 8 feet, and time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position 5 times.   results a wide distribution of performance was observed for each test. each test and a summary performance scale, created by summing categorical rankings of performance on each test, were strongly associated with self-report of disability. both self-report items and performance tests were independent predictors of short-term mortality and nursing home admission in multivariate analyses. however, evidence is presented that the performance tests provide information not available from self-report items. of particular importance is the finding that in those at the high end of the functional spectrum, who reported almost no disability, the performance test scores distinguished a gradient of risk for mortality and nursing home admission. additionally, within subgroups with identical self-report profiles, there were systematic differences in physical performance related to age and sex.   conclusion this study provides evidence that performance measures can validly characterize older persons across a broad spectrum of lower extremity function. performance and self-report measures may complement each other in providing useful information about functional status.
the reliability of grazing rate estimates from dilution experiments: have we over-estimated rates of organic carbon consumption? abstract using the seawater dilution technique, we measured phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates within and outside of the 1999 bering sea coccolithophorid bloom. we found that reduced microzooplankton grazing mortality is a key component in the formation and temporal persistence of the emiliania huxleyi bloom that continues to proliferate in the southeast bering sea. total chlorophyll a (chl a) at the study sites ranged from 0.40 to 4.45 μg c l−1. highest phytoplankton biomass was found within the bloom, which was a mixed assemblage of diatoms and e. huxleyi. here, 75% of the chl a came from cells >10 μm and was attributed primarily to the high abundance of the diatom nitzschia spp. nutrient-enhanced total phytoplankton growth rates averaged 0.53 d−1 across all experimental stations. average growth rates for >10 μm and 10 μm ranged from 0.19 to 1.14 d−1. grazing on cells 10 and 10 μm were higher than previously reported for the region, ranging from 22,000 to 227,430 cells l−1 and 18 to 164 μg c l−1. highest abundance and biomass occurred in the bloom and corresponded with increased abundance of the large ciliate laboea, and the heterotrophic dinoflagellates protoperidinium and gyrodinium spp. despite low grazing rates on phytoplankton
invasive and flexible: niche shift in the drosophilid zaprionus indianus (insecta, diptera) abstract we introduce the concept of the mahalanobis distance to bioclimatic modeling. specifically, we argue that climatic envelopes defined by the mahalanobis distance produce more accurate predictions of species distribution than standard rectilinear envelopes (e.g. those produced by bioclim ). we base our hypothesis on three rationales: (1) the climatic envelope generated by the mahalanobis distance is oblique, and therefore, may cope with correlations and interactions among the climatic variables; (2) the mahalanobis envelope is elliptic, and therefore, better reflects the principle of central tendency as expressed by niche theory; (3) mahalanobian predictions are based on the whole data rather than on the outermost observations, and are therefore, less sensitive to outliers. we test our hypothesis using data on the distribution of 192 species of woody plants in israel. validation tests based on four measures of accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy and the kappa statistic) support our hypothesis, and suggest that mahalanobis models produce predictions that are significantly more accurate than those produced by corresponding rectilinear models. additional simulation experiments demonstrate that the superiority of mahalanobian models cannot be related to their elliptic shape, or their ability to cope with correlations among the climatic variables. accordingly, our conclusion is that the prime advantage of mahalanobian models originates from the fact that their climatic envelopes are defined using all the observations, as opposed to rectilinear envelopes that are founded on the outermost observations.
parallel input channels to mouse primary visual cortex from the moment the mouse model took center stage for studies of cortical arealization and map formation, there was an urgent need for methods to identify areal borders in the living animal. the need was met in part by intrinsic optical signal imaging, which has been successfully applied to map topographic representations in primary visual, auditory and somatosensory cortex. however, the challenge remains to register these maps to the underlying structure. this is especially important for studies of the mouse brain in which cortical areas are often only a few hundred microns across. here, we show that in visual cortex neuronal tracing with fluororuby and fluoroemerald can be used for transcranial imaging through the intact skull of callosal connections from the opposite side of the brain, and for mapping of topographic striate-extrastriate cortical pathways in living mice. because callosal connections are important landmarks for cortical areas, the new method will allow registration of functional maps to underlying structures and facilitate targeted single-unit recordings in identified cortical areas.
interleukin-18 mediates interleukin-1-induced cardiac dysfunction. background heart failure (hf) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by impaired cardiac function and poor exercise tolerance. enhanced inflammation is associated with worsening outcomes in hf patients and may play a direct role in disease progression. interleukin-1β (il-1β) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that becomes chronically elevated in hf and exerts putative negative inotropic effects. methods and results we developed a model of il-1β-induced left ventricular (lv) dysfunction in healthy mice that exhibited a 32% reduction in lv fractional shortening (p<0.001) and a 76% reduction in isoproterenol response (p<0.01) at 4 hours following a single dose of il-1β 3 mcg/kg. this phenotype was reproducible in mice injected with plasma from hf patients and fully preventable by pretreatment with il-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra). this led to the design and conduct of a pilot clinical to test the effect of anakinra on cardiopulmonary exercise performance in patients with hf and evidence of elevated inflammatory signaling (n = 7). the median peak oxygen consumption (vo2) improved from 12.3 [10.0, 15.2] to 15.1 [13.7, 19.3] ml·kg–1·min–1 (p = 0.016 vs. baseline) and median ventilator efficiency (ve/vco2 slope) improved from 28.1 [22.8, 31.7] to 24.9 [22.9, 28.3] (p = 0.031 vs. baseline). conclusions these findings suggest that il-1β activity contributes to poor exercise tolerance in patients with systolic hf and identifies il-1β blockade as a novel strategy for pharmacologic intervention. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov nct01300650
different roles of bdnf in nucleus accumbens core versus shell during the incubation of cue-induced cocaine craving and its long-term maintenance cocaine addiction in humans is associated with long-term propensity to relapse. using a rat relapse model, we found that cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine-associated cues progressively increases after withdrawal. this progressive increase is associated with increases in brain-derived nerve growth factor (bdnf) levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system. based on these findings, we studied whether bdnf infusions into the ventral tegmental area (vta), the cell body region of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, would potentiate cocaine seeking after withdrawal. rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 d, and cocaine seeking was measured in extinction tests 3, 10, or 30 d after withdrawal. during testing, rats were exposed to contextual cues that had predicted cocaine availability during training, and lever presses resulted in contingent presentations of a discrete tone-light cue that was previously temporally paired with cocaine infusions. bdnf (0-0.75 μg/site) or nerve growth factor (ngf; 0-0.75 μg/site) was infused into the vta 1-2 hr after the last self-administration session. to examine the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway in bdnf effects, u0126 (1 μg/site), an mek inhibitor, was used. a single intra-vta infusion of bdnf, but not ngf, induced long-lasting enhancement of cocaine seeking for up to 30 d, an effect reversed by u0126. in contrast, neither bdnf infusions into the substantia nigra, nor acute intra-vta bdnf infusions 2 hr before testing on day 3 of withdrawal, were effective. these data suggest that bdnf-mediated neuroadaptations in mesolimbic areas are involved in the persistent cocaine seeking induced by exposure to drug cues after withdrawal.
simulation as a preoperative planning approach in advanced heart failure patients. a retrospective clinical analysis backgroundthis study tested whether the simple ratio of ventricular end-systolic pressure to stroke volume, known as the effective arterial elastance (ea), provides a valid measure of arterial load in humans with normal and aged hypertensive vasculatures. methods and resultsventricular pressure-volume and invasive aortic pressure and flow were simultaneously determined in 10 subjects (four young normotensive and six older hypertensive). measurements were obtained at rest, during mechanically reduced preload, and after pharmacological interventions. two measures of arterial load were compared: one was derived from aortic input impedance and arterial compliance data using an algebraic expression based on a three-element windkessel model of the arterial system [ea(z)i, and the other was more simply measured as the ratio of ventricular end-systolic pressure to stroke volume [ea(pv)]. although derived from completely different data sources and despite the simplifying assumptions of ea(pv), both ea(z) and ea(pv) were virtually identical over a broad range of altered conditions: ea(pv) = 0.97 · ea(z) +0.17; n = 33, r2 = 0.98, see = 0.09, p < 0.0001. whereas ea(pv) also correlated with mean arterial resistance, it exceeded resistance by as much as 25% in older hypertensive subjects (because of reduced compliance and wave reflections), which better indexed the arterial load effects on the ventricle. simple methods to estimate ea (pv) from routine arterial pressures were tested and validated. conclusionsea(pv) provides a convenient, useful method to assess arterial load and its impact on the human ventricle. these results highlight effects of increased pulsatile load caused by aging or hypertension on the pressure-volume loop and indicate that this load and its effects on cardiac performance are often underestimated by mean arterial resistance but are better accounted for by ea.
garment image retrieval on the web with ubiquitous camera-phone text-based image search engine and content-based image retrieval (cbir) have achieved much progress in commercial and academic community respectively. however, few attempts have been conducted to integrate the two techniques for image retrieval in web context. in this paper, based on a novel web image data model, i.e. fine-grained web image model (fgwim), a flexible and extensible framework for web image retrieval is proposed, which incorporates highlevel semantics and low-level visual features of web images and supports the visual part of mpeg-7 standard. fgwim model describes the web image data in several levels of abstraction by fine-grained and structured representation, and gives multiple choices at each level, which provides a good flexibility and extensibility for further feature extraction, similarity measurement, integration of semantic and visual features. based on fgwim model and the framework, a web image retrieval system prototype is implemented.
implementing an online pharmaceutical service using design science research this article introduces the service experience blueprint (seb), a multidisciplinary method for designing multi-interface service experiences, and illustrates its application with two case examples of the redesign of the service experiences of a multichannel bank. the seb method starts by studying the customer service experience to understand customer experience requirements for different service activities and how these requirements can be satisfied through alternative service interfaces. based on this analysis, the multi-interface service is designed to allocate service activities to the interfaces best suited to provide the desired experience, defining channel specialization and integration. finally, with the seb method each service interface is designed to best leverage its unique capabilities and guide customers to other service interfaces whenever that interface better enhances the overall customer experience. by incorporating the contributions of service management, interaction design, and software engineering, the seb method is a multidisciplinary tool and terminology for service design.
controversial issues in kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebral fractures purpose to prospectively assess the short-term clinical outcome of patients with subacute or chronic painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (vcf) treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty (pv) compared with optimal pain medication (opm).   methods randomization of patients in 2 groups: treatment by pv or opm. after 2 weeks, patients from the opm arm could change therapy to pv. patients were evaluated 1 day and 2 weeks after treatment. visual analog score (vas) for pain and analgesic use were assessed before, and 1 day and 2 weeks after start of treatment. quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis (qualeffo) and roland-morris disability (rmd) questionnaire scores were assessed before and 2 weeks after start of treatment. follow-up scores in patients requesting pv treatment after 2 weeks opm treatment were compared with scores during their opm period.   results eighteen patients treated with pv compared with 16 patients treated with opm had significantly better vas and used less analgesics 1 day after treatment. two weeks after treatment, the mean vas was less but not significantly different in patients treated with opm, whereas these patients used significantly less analgesics and had better qualeffo and rmd scores. scores in the pv arm were influenced by occurrence of new vcf in 2 patients. after 2 weeks opm, 14 patients requested pv treatment. all scores, 1 day and 2 weeks after pv, were significantly better compared with scores during conservative treatment.   conclusion pain relief and improvement of mobility, function, and stature after pv is immediate and significantly better in the short term compared with opm treatment.
key learning outcomes for clinical pharmacology and therapeutics education in europe: a modified delphi study a new curriculum is planned for the medical school at lund university, sweden. pharmacology, in a broad sense, has been identified as a subject that needs to be strengthened based on needs in the healthcare system. the aim was to identify the competencies in basic and clinical pharmacology that a newly qualified physician needs. using a modified three‐round delphi technique, 31 physicians were invited to list necessary competencies (round 1). after content analysis, these panel members classified the list by importance on two occasions (rounds 2 and 3) using a 4‐point scale (4 = necessary, 3 = desirable, 2 = useful, 1 = not necessary). competencies with the highest ranks based on necessity were retained. thirty physicians accepted the invitation and 25 (83%) of them completed all three rounds. round 1 resulted in 258 suggestions, which were subsequently reduced to 95 competencies. of these 95 competencies, 40 were considered necessary by at least 75% of the panel members. the degree of consensus increased between round 2 and round 3. using a modified delphi technique, we identified 40 competencies that could be transferred to learning outcomes for a new curriculum in basic and clinical pharmacology at medical school.
hmga proteins promote atm expression and enhance cancer cell resistance to genotoxic agents the high mobility group hmga1 protein belongs to a family of architectural factors that play a role in chromosomal organisation and gene transcription regulation. hmga1 overexpression represents a common feature of human malignant tumours and is causally associated with neoplastic transformation and metastatic progression. recently, hmga1 expression has been correlated with the presence of chromosomal rearrangements and suggested to promote genomic instability. here, we report a novel interaction between hmga1 protein and the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) kinase, the major key player in the cellular response to dna damage caused by several agents such as ionising radiation (ir). we identified an sq motif on hmga1, which is effectively phosphorylated by atm in vitro and in vivo. interestingly, confocal microscopy revealed that hmga1 colocalises with the activated form of atm (atm s1981p). moreover, hmga1 ectopic expression decreases cell survival following exposure to ir as assessed by clonogenic survival in mcf-7 cells, further supporting the hypothesis that hmga1 might act as a downstream target of the atm pathway in response to dna damage.
multiview absolute pose using 3d – 2d perspective line correspondences and vertical direction a large number of absolute pose algorithms have been presented in the literature. common performance criteria are computational complexity, geometric optimality, global optimality, structural degeneracies, and the number of solutions. the ability to handle minimal sets of correspondences, resulting solution multiplicity, and generalized cameras are further desirable properties. this paper presents the first pnp solution that unifies all the above desirable properties within a single algorithm. we compare our result to state-of-the-art minimal, non-minimal, central, and non-central pnp algorithms, and demonstrate universal applicability, competitive noise resilience, and superior computational efficiency. our algorithm is called unified pnp (upnp).
automated benchmarking of description logic reasoners in this paper, we describe swoop, a hypermedia inspired ontology browser and editor based on owl, the recently standardized web-oriented ontology language. after discussing the design rationale and architecture of swoop, we focus mainly on its features, using illustrative examples to highlight its use. we demonstrate that with its web-metaphor, adherence to owl recommendations and key unique features, such as collaborative annotation using annotea, swoop acts as a useful and efficient web ontology development tool. we conclude with a list of future plans for swoop, that should further increase its overall appeal and accessibility.
exercise increases serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (fgf21) levels objective fibroblast growth factor 21 (fgf21) levels have been linked with beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in animals. it is elevated in humans with the metabolic syndrome. this study investigates independent factors associated with serum fgf21 levels.   design cross-sectional study done in healthy blue-collar workers.   methods a medical history was taken, and fgf21 (measured using an elisa commercial kit), glucose, uric acid, plasma lipids, total/high-molecular weight (hmw) adiponectin, and retinal-binding protein 4 (rbp4) were measured in 210 individuals with (n=81) and without (n=129) metabolic syndrome.   results the median of serum fgf21 levels were higher in subjects with metabolic syndrome (339.5 vs 276.4 ng/l, p=0.01). serum fgf21 levels correlated positively with body mass index (bmi; r=0.23, p=0.001) and age (r=0.17, p=0.01). after adjusting for age and bmi, a significant positive correlation persisted for fasting glucose, uric acid, and physical activity in both males (r=0.21, r=0.11, and r=0.19, all p<0.05) and females (r=0.20, r=0.19, and r=0.14, all p<0.05). in addition, fgf21 also correlates negatively with rbp4 (r=-0.27, p=0.02), total (r=-0.26, p=0.03), and hmw adiponectin (r=-0.30, p=0.01) in women. a multiple linear regression model analysis identified that bmi (standardized beta (sb)=0.247; p=0.008), glucose (sb=0.226; p=0.003), uric acid (sb=0.191; p=0.04), and physical activity (sb=0.223; p=0.004) are independent factors influencing serum fgf21 levels (f=10.05, r(2)=0.19, p<0.001). in addition, fasting hyperglycemia > or =100 mg/dl, excess body weight with bmi > or =25 kg/m(2), and uric acid > or =5.5 mg/dl predicted higher serum fgf21 levels.   conclusion serum fgf21 levels are influenced by bmi, fasting glycemia, uric acid, and physical activity.
prevalence of bacterial pathogens in biofilms of drinking water distribution systems. we report the design and evaluation of pcr primers 63f and 1387r for amplification of 16s rrna genes from bacteria. their specificity and efficacy were tested systematically with a bacterial species and environmental samples. they were found to be more useful for 16s rrna gene amplification in ecological and systematic studies than pcr amplimers that are currently more generally used.
latent variable analysis and signal separation abstract after a decade of extensive study of the sparse representation synthesis model, we can safely say that this is a mature and stable field, with clear theoretical foundations, and appealing applications. alongside this approach, there is an analysis counterpart model, which, despite its similarity to the synthesis alternative, is markedly different. surprisingly, the analysis model did not get a similar attention, and its understanding today is shallow and partial. in this paper we take a closer look at the analysis approach, better define it as a generative model for signals, and contrast it with the synthesis one. this work proposes effective pursuit methods that aim to solve inverse problems regularized with the analysis-model prior, accompanied by a preliminary theoretical study of their performance. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis model in several experiments, and provide a detailed study of the model associated with the 2d finite difference analysis operator, a close cousin of the tv norm.
mito‐nuclear discord in six congeneric lineages of holarctic ducks (genus anas) reconstructing species trees by incorporating information from many independent gene trees reduces the confounding influence of stochastic lineage sorting. such analyses are particularly important for taxa that share polymorphisms due to incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization. we investigated phylogenetic relationships among 14 closely related taxa from the mallard (anas spp.) complex using the multispecies coalescent and 20 nuclear loci sampled from a genomic transect. we also examined how treating recombining loci and hybridizing species influences results by partitioning the data using various protocols. in general, topologies were similar among the various species trees, with major clades consistently composed of the same taxa. however, relationships among these clades and among taxa within clades changed among partitioned data sets. posterior support generally decreased when filtering for recombination, whereas excluding mallards (anas platyrhynchos) increased posterior support for taxa known to hybridize with them. furthermore, branch lengths decreased substantially for recombination-filtered data. finally, concordance between nuclear and morphometric topologies conflicted with those in the mitochondrial tree, particularly with regard to the placement of the hawaiian duck (a. wyvilliana), philippine duck (a. luzonica), and two spot-billed ducks (a. zonorhyncha and a. poecilorhyncha). these results demonstrate the importance of maximizing sequence length and taxon sampling when inferring taxonomic relationships that are confounded by extensive allele sharing.
learning to rank using high-order information machine learning is commonly used to improve ranked retrieval systems. due to computational difficulties, few learning techniques have been developed to directly optimize for mean average precision (map), despite its widespread use in evaluating such systems. existing approaches optimizing map either do not find a globally optimal solution, or are computationally expensive. in contrast, we present a general svm learning algorithm that efficiently finds a globally optimal solution to a straightforward relaxation of map. we evaluate our approach using the trec 9 and trec 10 web track corpora (wt10g), comparing against svms optimized for accuracy and rocarea. in most cases we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements in map scores.
non-parametric domain approximation for scalable gibbs sampling in mlns lifted inference algorithms take advantage of symmetries in first-order probabilistic logic representations such as markov logic networks (mlns), and are naturally more scalable than propositional inference algorithms which ground the mln. however, lifted inference algorithms have an "evidence problem" - evidence breaks symmetries, and the performance of lifted inference algorithms is the same as propositional inference algorithms (or sometimes worse, due to overhead). in this paper, we propose a general method for addressing this problem. the main idea in our method is to approximate the given mln having, say, n objects by an mln having k objects such that k ≪ n and the results obtained by running potentially much faster inference on the smaller mln are as close as possible to the ones obtained by running inference on the larger mln. we achieve this by finding clusters of "similar" groundings using standard clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means), and replacing all groundings in the cluster by their cluster center. to this end, we develop a novel distance (or similarity) function for measuring the similarity between two groundings, based on the evidence presented to the mln. we evaluated our approach on different benchmarks utilizing various clustering and inference algorithms. our experiments clearly show the generality and scalability of our approach.
reproductive number and serial interval of the first wave of influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 virus in south africa background we documented the introduction of 2009 pandemic influenza a virus subtype h1n1 (a[h1n1]pdm09) into south africa and describe its clinical presentation, epidemiology, and transmissibility.   methods we conducted a prospective descriptive study of the first 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of a(h1n1)pdm09 infections identified through active case finding and surveillance. infected patients and the attending clinicians were interviewed, and close contacts were followed up to investigate household transmission.   findings the first case was confirmed on 14 june 2009, and by 15 july 2009, 100 cases were diagnosed. forty-two percent of patients reported international travel within 7 days prior to onset of illness. patients ranged in age from 4 to 70 years (median age, 21.5 years). seventeen percent of household contacts developed influenza-like illness, and 10% of household contacts had laboratory-confirmed a(h1n1)pdm09 infection. we found a mean serial interval (± sd) of 2.3 ± 1.3 days (range, 1-5 days) between successive laboratory-confirmed cases in the transmission chain.   conclusions a(h1n1)pdm09 established itself rapidly in south africa. transmissibility of the virus was comparable to observations from outside of africa and to seasonal influenza virus strains.
similar improvement in gait parameters following direct anterior & posterior approach total hip arthroplasty. minimally invasive joint arthroplasties have gained in popularity this decade for multiple reasons. many different authors have described markedly different approaches to minimally invasive hip arthroplasties, and there is no consensus for a single definition of what is minimally invasive. the basic premise of minimizing soft tissue disruption would be best met by going through intermuscular and internervous planes to do the procedure. in hip arthroplasty, the direct anterior approach to the hip is the only such approach. this article will describe this technique using a standard operating room table rather than using a specialized fracture table.
dopaminergic medication in parkinson’s disease and problem gambling the padua inventory (pi), a self-report measure of obsessive and compulsive symptoms, is increasingly used in obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) research. freeston, ladouceur, rheaume, letarte, gagnon and thibodeau (1994) [behaviour research and therapy, 32, 29-36], however, recently showed that the pi measures worry in addition to obsessions. in an attempt to solve this measurement problem, this study used a content distinction between obsessions and worry to revise the pi. the revision was constructed to measure five content dimensions relevant to ocd i.e. (1) obsessional thoughts about harm to oneself or others; (2) obsessional impulses to harm oneself or others; (3) contamination obsessions and washing compulsions; (4) checking compulsions; and (5) dressing/grooming compulsions. a total of 5010 individuals participated in the study, 2970 individuals completing the pi and the penn state worry questionnaire (pswq) and an additional 2040 individuals completing only the pi. the results provided support for the reliability and validity of the revision. in addition, the revision of the pi was more independent of worry, as measured by the pswq, than the original pi. support was thus found for the validity of the content distinction between obsessions and worry. the importance of this content distinction is also discussed for the evaluation of other hypothesized distinctions between obsessions and worry.
karyotypic conservatism in five species of prochilodus (characiformes, prochilodontidae) disclosed by cytogenetic markers atlantic salmon 5s ribosomal dna (5s rdna) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using as primers conserved sequences from the coding region of rainbow trout 5s rrna. two amplified products of different molecular weights were obtained, cloned, and sequenced, revealing them to be tandemly arranged. the nucleotide sequences differed between the two clones in the length of the nontranscribed spacer (nts) and in three nucleotides of the coding sequence. by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization the 5s rdna was chromosomally located in the heterochromatic arm of the pair bearing the satellite, adjacent to the major ribosomal dna locus (rdna).
cel: modeling everywhere developers spend significant time reading and navigating code fragments spread across multiple locations. the file-based nature of contemporary ides makes it prohibitively difficult to create and maintain a simultaneous view of such fragments. we propose a novel user interface metaphor for code understanding based on collections of lightweight, editable fragments called bubbles, which form concurrently visible working sets. we present the results of a qualitative usability evaluation, and the results of a quantitative study which indicates code bubbles significantly improved code understanding time, while reducing navigation interactions over a widely-used ide, for two controlled tasks.
efficient implementation of inner-outer flexible gmres for the method of moments based on a volume-surface integral equation method of moments (mom) solutions of surface integral equations are among the most successful methods for solving scattering and radiation problems involving metallic objects. a simple and effective preconditioning technique is introduced for the iterative solution of multilevel fast multipole algorithm (mlfma) equation systems from the combined field integral equation (cfie). the preconditioner is derived from the near zone strong interaction matrix elements of the coupling matrix and its iteration avoids the typical fill-in problem associated with direct factorization methods. using the preconditioner with an inner generalized minimum residual (gmres) solver results in excellent convergence with fewer iterative steps. this keeps a low memory requirement and helps to alleviate the influence of the lost convergence information for the conventional restarted gmres.
episodic memory and episodic future thinking in adults with autism. two experiments were conducted to explore the extent to which individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd), as well as young typically developing (td) children, are explicitly aware of their own and others' intentions. in experiment 1, participants with asd were significantly less likely than age- and ability-matched comparison participants to correctly recognize their own knee-jerk reflex movements as unintentional. performance on this knee-jerk task was associated with performance on measures of false belief understanding, independent of age and verbal ability, in both participants with asd and td children. in experiment 2, participants with asd were significantly less able than comparison participants to correctly recognize their own or another person's mistaken actions as unintended, in a 'transparent intentions' task (russell & hill, 2001; russell, hill & franco, 2001). performance on aspects of the transparent intentions task was associated with performance on measures of false belief understanding, independent of age and verbal ability, in both participants with asd and td children. this study suggests that individuals with asd have a diminished awareness of their own and others' intentions and that this diminution is associated with other impairments in theory of mind.
atmospheric oh reactivities in the pearl river delta – china in summer 2006: measurement and model results the most important chemical cleaning agent of the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical, oh. it determines the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, and thereby controls the removal of nearly all gaseous atmospheric pollutants. the atmospheric supply of oh is limited, however, and could be overcome by consumption due to increasing pollution and climate change, with detrimental feedback effects. to date, the high variability of oh concentrations has prevented the use of local observations to monitor possible trends in the concentration of this species. here we present and analyse long-term measurements of atmospheric oh concentrations, which were taken between 1999 and 2003 at the meteorological observatory hohenpeissenberg in southern germany. we find that the concentration of oh can be described by a surprisingly linear dependence on solar ultraviolet radiation throughout the measurement period, despite the fact that oh concentrations are influenced by thousands of reactants. a detailed numerical model of atmospheric reactions and measured trace gas concentrations indicates that the observed correlation results from compensations between individual processes affecting oh, but that a full understanding of these interactions may not be possible on the basis of our current knowledge of atmospheric chemistry. as a consequence of the stable relationship between oh concentrations and ultraviolet radiation that we observe, we infer that there is no long-term trend in the level of oh in the hohenpeissenberg data set.
the arabidopsis aaa atpase skd1 is involved in multivesicular endosome function and interacts with its positive regulator lyst-interacting protein5[w] mineral-accumulating compartments in developing seeds of arabidopsis were studied using high-pressure-frozen/freeze-substituted samples. developing seeds store minerals in three locations: in the protein storage vacuoles of the embryo, and transiently in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and vacuolar compartments of the chalazal endosperm. energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and enzyme treatments suggest that the minerals are stored as phytic acid (myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) salts in all three compartments, although they differ in cation composition. whereas embryo globoids contain mg, k, and ca as cations, the chalazal er deposits show high levels of mn, and the chalazal vacuolar deposits show high levels of zn. the appearance of the first zn-phytate crystals coincides with the formation of network-like extensions of the chalazal vacuoles. the core of these networks consists of a branched network of tubular er membranes, which are separated from the delineating tonoplast membranes by a layer of cytosolic material. degradation of the networks starts with the loss of the cytosol and is followed by the retraction of the er, generating a network of collapsed tonoplast membranes that are resorbed. studies of fertilized fis2 seeds, which hyperaccumulate zn-phytate crystals in the chalazal vacuolar compartments, suggest that only the intact network is active in mineral sequestration. mineral determination analysis and structural observations showed that zn and mn are mobilized from the endosperm to the embryo at different developmental stages. thus, zn appears to be removed from the endosperm at the late globular stage, and mn stores appear to be removed at the late bent-cotyledon stage of embryo development. the disappearance of the mn-phytate from the endosperm coincides with the accumulation of two major mn binding proteins in the embryo, the 33-kd protein from the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem ii and the mn superoxide dismutase. the possible functions of transient heavy metal storage in the chalazal endosperm are discussed. a model showing how phytic acid, a potentially cytotoxic molecule, is transported from its site of synthesis, the er, to the different mineral storage sites is presented.
the cost effectiveness of radon remediation programmes in hospitals, schools and homes in radon affected areas in the uk. a comprehensive radon survey of 2372 rooms in 348 northamptonshire schools is reported, together with results of the successful mitigation of the raised radon levels found in 20 schools. from analysis of the occupancy of affected rooms and the costs of remediation a total cost of 19,400 pounds per man-sievert saved annually was derived. this is around four times more cost-effective than the radon remediation in health service premises in northamptonshire, and slightly more cost-effective than a domestic programme where all householders with radon levels above the action level carry out remediation. as only a small percentage of householders undertook remediation, a schools' remediation programme is the most cost-effective programme to reduce radon in an affected area.
neuter is not common in dutch: eye movements reveal asymmetrical gender processing the sounds that make up spoken words are heard in a series and must be mapped rapidly onto words in memory because their elements, unlike those of visual words, cannot simultaneously exist or persist in time. although theories agree that the dynamics of spoken word recognition are important, they differ in how they treat the nature of the competitor set-precisely which words are activated as an auditory word form unfolds in real time. this study used eye tracking to measure the impact over time of word frequency and 2 partially overlapping competitor set definitions: onset density and neighborhood density. time course measures revealed early and continuous effects of frequency (facilitatory) and on set based similarity (inhibitory). neighborhood density appears to have early facilitatory effects and late inhibitory effects. the late inhibitory effects are due to differences in the temporal distribution of similarity within neighborhoods. the early facilitatory effects are due to subphonemic cues that inform the listener about word length before the entire word is heard. the results support a new conception of lexical competition neighborhoods in which recognition occurs against a background of activated competitors that changes over time based on fine-grained goodness-of-fit and competition dynamics.

virulence factors in pneumococcal respiratory pathogenesis. epithelial cells represent the first line of host innate defense against invading microbes by elaborating a range of molecules involved in pathogen clearance. in particular, epithelial mucins facilitate the mucociliary clearance by physically trapping inhaled microbes. up-regulation of mucin production thus represents an important host innate defense response against invading microbes. how mucin is induced in upper respiratory streptococcus pneumoniae infections is unknown. in this study, we show that pneumolysin is required for up-regulation of muc5ac mucin via tlr4-dependent activation of erk in human epithelial cells in vitro and in mice in vivo. interestingly, a "second wave" of erk activation appears to be important in mediating muc5ac induction. moreover, ikappab kinase (ikk) alpha and ikkbeta are distinctly involved in muc5ac induction via an erk1-dependent, but ikappabalpha-p65- and p100-p52-independent, mechanism, thereby revealing novel roles for ikks in mediating up-regulation of muc5ac mucin by s. pneumoniae.
evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis. progressive tissue fibrosis can compromise epithelial function resulting in organ failure. appreciating evidence suggests that fibroblasts provide fibrogenic collagens during such injury. we further tested this notion by attempting to reduce the physiologic consequences of organ fibrosis through the selective killing of fibroblasts at sites of injury. here, we report the conditional reduction of tissue fibroblasts using the coding sequence for herpesvirus thymidine kinase (deltatk) put under the control of a cell-specific promoter from the gene encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). transgenic fibroblasts from mice carrying fsp1.deltatk minigenes expressed thymidine kinase concordantly with native fsp1 and, compared to transgenic epithelium, were selectively susceptible to the lethal effects of nucleoside analogs either in culture or during experimental renal fibrosis. the numbers of fibroblasts in fibrogenic kidney tissue were reduced on exposure to nucleoside analogs as was the degree of type i collagen deposition and the extent of fibrosis. fibroblast reduction following the stress of dna chain termination highlights the important contribution of cell division during fibrogenesis. our findings convey a proof of principle regarding the importance of fsp1(+) fibroblasts in fibrosis as well as providing a new approach to treating the relentless scarification of tissue.
gradient descent optimization of smoothed information retrieval metrics this paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. while previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. this makes them difficult and expensive to apply. the goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. taking a support vector machine (svm) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. from a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. the theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. it shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.
nonrandom divergence of gene expression following gene and genome duplications in the flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana regulatory regions of plant genes tend to be more compact than those of animal genes, but the complement of transcription factors encoded in plant genomes is as large or larger than that found in those of animals. plants therefore provide an opportunity to study how transcriptional programs control multicellular development. we analyzed global gene expression during development of the reference plant arabidopsis thaliana in samples covering many stages, from embryogenesis to senescence, and diverse organs. here, we provide a first analysis of this data set, which is part of the atgenexpress expression atlas. we observed that the expression levels of transcription factor genes and signal transduction components are similar to those of metabolic genes. examining the expression patterns of large gene families, we found that they are often more similar than would be expected by chance, indicating that many gene families have been co-opted for specific developmental processes.
herg k+ channel-associated cardiac effects of the antidepressant drug desipramine the diamidine pentamidine is used to treat leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. treatment may be accompanied by prolongation of the qt interval of the electrocardiogram and torsades de pointes tachycardias. up to now, it has been thought that therapeutic compounds causing qt prolongation are associated with direct block of the cardiac potassium channel human ether a-go-go-related gene (herg), which encodes the α subunit of cardiac ikr currents. we show that pentamidine has no acute effects on currents produced by herg, kvlqt1/mink, kv4.3, or scna5. cardiac calcium currents and the guinea pig cardiac action potential were also not affected. after overnight exposure, however, pentamidine reduced herg currents and inhibited trafficking and maturation of herg with ic50 values of 5 to 8 μm similar to therapeutic concentrations. surface expression determined in a chemiluminescence assay was reduced on exposure to 10, 30, and 100 μm pentamidine by about 30, 40, and 70%, respectively. these effects were specific for herg since expression of hkv1.5, kvlqt1/mink, and kv4.3 was not altered. in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, 10 μm pentamidine prolonged action potential duration apd90 from 374.3 ± 57.1 to 893.9 ± 86.2 ms on overnight incubation. ikr tail current density was reduced from 0.61 ± 0.09 to 0.39 ± 0.04 pa/pf. we conclude that pentamidine prolongs the cardiac action potential by block of herg trafficking and reduction of the number of functional herg channels at the cell surface. we propose that pentamidine, like arsenic trioxide, produces qt prolongation and torsades de pointes in patients by inhibition of herg trafficking.
the relationship between specific cognitive defects and burden of care in parkinson's disease. there is a need to assess the contribution of mood disorder, especially anxiety and depression, in order to understand the experience of suffering in the setting of medical practice. most physicians are aware of this aspect of the illness of their patients but many feel incompetent to provide the patient with reliable information. the hospital anxiety and depression scale, or hads, was designed to provide a simple yet reliable tool for use in medical practice. the term 'hospital' in its title suggests that it is only valid in such a setting but many studies conducted throughout the world have confirmed that it is valid when used in community settings and primary care medical practice. it should be emphasised that self-assessment scales are only valid for screening purposes; definitive diagnosis must rest on the process of clinical examination.
a hybrid approach to query sets broadcasting scheduling for multiple channels in mobile information systems this paper discusses the issue of power conservation on mobile clients, e.g., palmtop, in wireless and mobile environments. it suggests that techniques using signatures are suitable for realtime information filtering on mobile clients. three signature-based approaches, namely simple signature, integrated signature and multi-level signature schemes, are presented. the cost models for the access time and tune-in time of these three approaches are developed. we show that the multi-level signature method is in general better than the other two methods.
analysis of est data of the marine protist oxyrrhis marina, an emerging model for alveolate biology and evolution elimination of the data processing bottleneck in high-throughput sequencing will require both improved accuracy of data processing software and reliable measures of that accuracy. we have developed and implemented in our base-calling program phred the ability to estimate a probability of error for each base-call, as a function of certain parameters computed from the trace data. these error probabilities are shown here to be valid (correspond to actual error rates) and to have high power to discriminate correct base-calls from incorrect ones, for read data collected under several different chemistries and electrophoretic conditions. they play a critical role in our assembly program phrap and our finishing program consed.
collaboratively constructed knowledge repositories as a resource for domain independent concept extraction the main objective of our experiments in the domain-specific track at clef 2008 is utilizing semantic knowledge from collaborative knowledge bases such as wikipedia and wiktionary to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval. while wikipedia has already been used in ir, the application of wiktionary in this task is new. we evaluate two retrieval models, i.e. sr-text and sr-word, based on semantic relatedness by comparing their performance to a statistical model as implemented by lucene. we refer to wikipedia article titles and wiktionary word entries as concepts and map query and document terms to concept vectors which are then used to compute the document relevance. in the bilingual task, we translate the english topics into the document language, i.e. german, by using machine translation. for sr-text, we alternatively perform the translation process by using cross-language links in wikipedia, whereby the terms are directly mapped to concept vectors in the target language. the evaluation shows that the latter approach especially improves the retrieval performance in cases where the machine translation system incorrectly translates query terms.
aggression is suppressed by acute stress but induced by chronic stress: immobilization effects on aggression, hormones, and cortical 5-ht1b/ striatal dopamine d2 receptor density it has been recently reported that passive exposure to aggression induces aggressive behavior in a rodent model. however, it remains unclear whether this response is correlated with neurochemical changes that correspond either to stress-induced aggression or non-stressed, learned aggression. stress-induced aggression has been shown to result in increased brain dopamine d(2) receptor and serum corticosterone levels. in contrast, learned aggression is probably associated with reward deficiency syndrome, characterized by low dopamine d(2) receptor levels, without stress effects (i.e., high corticosterone levels). we hypothesized that chronic passive exposure to aggression would produce learned aggression, represented by low levels of dopamine d(2) receptor binding but normal levels of stress hormone. the present study additionally focused on serum testosterone and serotonin 5-ht(1b) receptor density that has been associated with aggression/reward circuits. hormonal results indicated that there were no differences between the "observer" rats that had been passively exposed to aggression and non-aggression for 10 min/day for 23 consecutive days. however, receptor binding autoradiography identified lower densities of dopamine d(2) receptors in the cortical-accumbal regions (shell of the nucleus accumbens and cingulate and motor cortices) and lower 5-ht(1b) receptor densities in the tegmental regions (ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and periaqueductal gray) among observers exposed to aggression, compared to controls. changes in dopamine d(2) receptor densities due to chronic exposure to aggression do not resemble those patterns reported for stress-induced aggressive behavior. our evidence suggests that the development of aggressive behavior among passive observers occurs through a learned, and not a stress-induced, mechanism.
anti‐tumour effects of small interfering rna targeting anion exchanger 1 in experimental gastric cancer renal cell carcinoma (rcc) represents one of the most resistant tumors to radiation and chemotherapy. current therapies for rcc patients are inefficient due to the lack of diagnostic and therapeutic markers. our recent studies have suggested an association of sperm-associated antigen 9 (spag9) with ovarian carcinomas. in the present study, we investigated the clinical relevance of spag9 in rcc patients. rt-pcr analysis showed expression of spag9 transcript in rcc tissues and rcc cell lines. in situ rna hybridization and immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed the expression of spag9 in 88% of cancer patients, suggesting that spag9 participates in renal cancer. in addition, immunoblotting and elisa analyses revealed a humoral immune response against spag9 in the sera of rcc patients but not in healthy individuals. consistent with the clinical findings, knockdown of spag9 expression in rcc cells with specific sirna significantly reduced cell growth and colony formation. using in vitro wound healing and matrigel invasion assays, we found that cell migration and invasive ability were also significantly inhibited. furthermore, in vivo xenograft studies in nude mice revealed that administration of a spag9 sirna plasmid significantly inhibited tumor growth. in conclusion, spag9 expression is associated with clinicopathologic features of tumors, suggesting that spag9 could contribute to the early spread of cancer. these results indicate that spag9 may have a role in tumor development and metastasis and thus could serve as a novel target for early detection and treatment of rcc.
impact of the knudsen number and mass-transfer expression on multi-phase kinetic modeling the reaction of ozone with aqueous sodium bromide particles is investigated with a combination of aerosol chamber experiments, kinetics modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. the molecular bromine production in the chamber experiments is approximately an order of magnitude greater than that predicted by known chemistry in the gas and bulk aqueous phases with use of a comprehensive computer kinetics model. molecular dynamics simulations indicate that ozone has significant residence time at the air−solution interface, while making frequent contacts with bromide ions for as long as 50 ps in the surface layer of a 6.1 m nabr solution. the formation of a complex between ozone and bromide ion, [o3···br-], which can lead to production of br2 by reaction at the air−water interface, is therefore feasible. experimentally observed br2 is well predicted by including an interface process with a reaction probability of [1.9 ± 0.8] × 10-6 (1 s) as the first step in a surface mechanism to produce additional gas-ph...
a multisource approach to improving epidemiologic estimates: application to global b-cell malignancies knowledge of the incidence of cancer is a fundamental requirement of rational planning and monitoring of cancer control programs. the lack of national-level information systems on health indicators in china means that estimation methods are required. estimates and projections of national level cancer mortality have been previously made using sample surveys of deaths. using these mortality data, incidence rates in 2000 and 2005 were estimated by means of the ratio of cancer cases/deaths (by site, age, and sex) in good quality cancer registries in china. a total of 2.1 million cancer cases were estimated for the year 2000 (1.3 million in men, 0.8 million in women), with the most common sites being lung, liver, and stomach in men, and breast, lung, and stomach in women. the total number of new cases is expected to increase by 14.6% by 2005, primarily as a result of population growth and aging. in addition, the rising rates of lung cancer incidence (in both sexes) and breast cancer mean that there will be much greater increases in the number of cases at these two sites (27% for lung cancer in men, 38% for lung and breast cancer in women). these two cancers are now the priorities for cancer prevention, early detection, and therapy in china.
the research activities of ontario’s large community acute care hospitals: a scoping review this paper focuses on scoping studies, an approach to reviewing the literature which to date has received little attention in the research methods literature. we distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. we outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. we emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.
eliminating the blind spot: adapting 3d object detection and monocular depth estimation to 360° panoramic imagery despite recent significant advances, object detection continues to be an extremely challenging problem in real scenarios. in order to develop a detector that successfully operates under these conditions, it becomes critical to leverage upon multiple cues, multiple imaging modalities, and a strong multiview (mv) classifier that accounts for different object views and poses. in this paper, we provide an extensive evaluation that gives insight into how each of these aspects (multicue, multimodality, and strong mv classifier) affect accuracy both individually and when integrated together. in the multimodality component, we explore the fusion of rgb and depth maps obtained by high-definition light detection and ranging, a type of modality that is starting to receive increasing attention. as our analysis reveals, although all the aforementioned aspects significantly help in improving the accuracy, the fusion of visible spectrum and depth information allows to boost the accuracy by a much larger margin. the resulting detector not only ranks among the top best performers in the challenging kitti benchmark, but it is built upon very simple blocks that are easy to implement and computationally efficient.
time trends in socioeconomic inequalities in cancer mortality: results from a 35 year prospective study in british men objective in this article we review different measures of socioeconomic position (sep) and their uses in health-related research.   areas of agreement socioeconomic circumstances influence health.   areas of controversy generally, poorer socioeconomic circumstances lead to poorer health. this has generated a search for generic mechanisms that could explain such a general association. however, we propose that there is a greater variation in the association between sep and health than is generally acknowledged when specific health outcomes are investigated. we propose that studying these variations provide a better understanding of the aetiological mechanisms relating specific diseases with specific exposures. areas to develop research: using different indicators of sep in health research can better capture these variations and is important when evaluating the full contribution of confounding by socioeconomic conditions. we propose that using an array of sep indicators within a life course framework also offers considerable opportunity to explore causal pathways in disease aetiology.
physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine in adults and children. part 2: 6-mercaptopurine and its interaction with methotrexate the tissue:plasma (p(t:p)) partition coefficients (pcs) are important drug-specific input parameters in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) models used to estimate the disposition of drugs in biota. until now the use of pbpk models in early stages of the drug discovery process was not possible, since the estimation of p(t:p) of new drug candidates by using conventional in vitro and/or in vivo methods is too time and cost intensive. the objectives of the study were (i) to develop and validate two mechanistic equations for predicting a priori the rabbit, rat and mouse p(t:p) of non-adipose and non-excretory tissues (bone, brain, heart, intestine, lung, muscle, skin, spleen) for 65 structurally unrelated drugs and (ii) to evaluate the adequacy of using p(t:p) of muscle as predictors for p(t:p) of other tissues. the first equation predicts p(t:p) at steady state, assuming a homogenous distribution and passive diffusion of drugs in tissues, from a ratio of solubility and macromolecular binding between tissues and plasma. the ratio of solubility was estimated from log vegetable oil:water pcs (k(vo:w)) of drugs and lipid and water levels in tissues and plasma, whereas the ratio of macromolecular binding for drugs was estimated from tissue interstitial fluid-to-plasma concentration ratios of albumin, globulins and lipoproteins. the second equation predicts p(t:p) of drugs residing predominantly in the interstitial space of tissues. therefore, the fractional volume content of interstitial space in each tissue replaced drug solubilities in the first equation. following the development of these equations, regression analyses between p(t:p) of muscle and those of the other tissues were examined. the average ratio of predicted-to-experimental p(t:p) values was 1.26 (sd = 1.40, r = 0.90, n = 269), and 85% of the 269 predicted values were within a factor of three of the corresponding literature values obtained under in vivo and in vitro conditions. for predicted and experimental p(t:p), linear relationships (r > 0.9 in most cases) were observed between muscle and other tissues, suggesting that p(t:p) of muscle is a good predictor for the p(t:p) of other tissues. the two previous equations could explain the mechanistic basis of these linear relationships. the practical aim of this study is a worthwhile goal for pharmacokinetic screening of new drug candidates.
beyond eating intentions: the role of working memory capacity in moderating the effects of restrained eating and implicit food activiation on eating behavior the current study demonstrates the separability of spatial and verbal working memory resources among college students. in experiment 1, we developed a spatial span task that taxes both the processing and storage components of spatial working memory. this measure correlates with spatial ability (spatial visualization) measures, but not with verbal ability measures. in contrast, the reading span test, a common test of verbal working memory, correlates with verbal ability measures, but not with spatial ability measures. experiment 2, which uses an interference paradigm to cross the processing and storage demands of span tasks, replicates this dissociation and further demonstrates that both the processing and storage components of working memory tasks are important for predicting performance on spatial thinking and language processing tasks.
functional analysis of the cowpea mosaic virus movement protein the 50 kda protein (50kp) encoded by orf2 of apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (aclsv) fused to green fluorescent protein (gfp) was expressed transiently in cells of nicotiana occidentalis and chenopodium quinoa leaves. its intracellular distribution, cell-to-cell trafficking in leaf epidermis and tubule formation on the surface of protoplasts were analysed. the 50kp-gfp fluorescence was distributed as small irregular spots or a fibrous network structure on the periphery of epidermal cells and protoplasts of both plant species. in leaf epidermis of n. occidentalis, the protein spread from the cells that produced it into neighbouring cells in both young and mature leaves and targetted plasmodesmata in these cells. in contrast, gfp was restricted to single cells in most cases in mature leaves. when 50kp and gfp were co-expressed in leaf epidermis of n. occidentalis, gfp spread more widely from the initial cells that produced it than when gfp was expressed alone, suggesting that 50kp facilitated the cell-to-cell trafficking of gfp. 50kp-gfp was able to complement local spread of 50kp-deficient virus when expressed transiently in leaf epidermis of c. quinoa. expression of 50kp-gfp in protoplasts resulted in the production of tubular structures protruding from the surface. mutational analyses showed that the c-terminal region (aa 287-457) was not essential for localization to plasmodesmata, cell-to-cell trafficking, complementation of movement of 50kp-deficient virus or tubule formation on protoplasts. in contrast, deletions in the n-terminal region resulted in the complete disruption of all these activities.
rationale and design of the duke electrophysiology genetic and genomic studies (epgen) biorepository. context allowing nonelectrophysiologists to perform implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd) procedures is controversial. however, it is not known whether outcomes of icd implantation vary by physician specialty.   objective to determine the association of implanting physician certification with outcomes following icd implantation.   design, setting, and patients retrospective cohort study using cases submitted to the icd registry performed between january 2006 and june 2007. patients were grouped by the certification status of the implanting physician into mutually exclusive categories: electrophysiologists, nonelectrophysiologist cardiologists, thoracic surgeons, and other specialists. hierarchical logistic regression models were developed to determine the independent association of physician certification with outcomes.   main outcome measures in-hospital procedural complication rates and the proportion of patients meeting criteria for a defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt-d) who received that device.   results of 111,293 icd implantations included in the analysis, 78,857 (70.9%) were performed by electrophysiologists, 24,399 (21.9%) by nonelectrophysiologist cardiologists, 1862 (1.7%) by thoracic surgeons, and 6175 (5.5%) by other specialists. compared with patients whose icd was implanted by electrophysiologists, patients whose icd was implanted by either nonelectrophysiologist cardiologists or thoracic surgeons were at increased risk of complications in both unadjusted (electrophysiologists, 3.5% [2743/78,857]; nonelectrophysiologist cardiologists, 4.0% [970/24,399]; thoracic surgeons, 5.8% [108/1862]; p < .001) and adjusted analyses (relative risk [rr] for nonelectrophysiologist cardiologists, 1.11 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 1.01-1.21]; rr for thoracic surgeons, 1.44 [95% ci, 1.15-1.79]). among 35,841 patients who met criteria for crt-d, those whose icd was implanted by physicians other than electrophysiologists were significantly less likely to receive a crt-d device compared with patients whose icd was implanted by an electrophysiologist in both unadjusted (electrophysiologists, 83.1% [21 303/25,635]; nonelectrophysiologist cardiologists, 75.8% [5950/7849]; thoracic surgeons, 57.8% [269/465]; other specialists, 74.8% [1416/1892]; p < .001) and adjusted analyses (rr for nonelectrophysiologist cardiologists, 0.93 [95% ci, 0.91-0.95]; rr for thoracic surgeons, 0.81 [95% ci, 0.74-0.88]; rr for other specialists, 0.97 [95% ci, 0.94-0.99]).   conclusions in this registry, nonelectrophysiologists implanted 29% of icds. overall, implantations by a nonelectrophysiologist were associated with a higher risk of procedural complications and lower likelihood of receiving a crt-d device when indicated compared with patients whose icd was implanted by an electrophysiologist.
effectiveness of interventions for pain relief in hysterosalpingographyanetwork meta-analysis and systematic review specialist infertility practice was studied in a group of 708 couples within a population of residents of a single health district in england. they represented an annual incidence of 1.2 couples for every 1000 of the population. at least one in six couples needed specialist help at some time in their lives because of an average of infertility of 21/2 years, 71% of whom were trying for their first baby. those attending gynaecology clinics made up 10% of new and 22% of all attendances. failure of ovulation (amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea) occurred in 21% of cases and was successfully treated (two year conception rates of 96% and 78%). tubal damage (14%) had a poor outlook (19%) despite surgery. endometriosis accounted for infertility in 6%, although seldom because of tubal damage, cervical mucus defects or dysfunction in 3%, and coital failure in up to 6%. sperm defects or dysfunction were the commonest defined cause of infertility (24%) and led to a poor chance of pregnancy (0-27%) without donor insemination. obstructive azoospermia or primary spermatogenic failure was uncommon (2%) and hormonal causes of male infertility rare. infertility was unexplained in 28% and the chance of pregnancy (overall 72%) was mainly determined by duration of infertility. in vitro fertilisation could benefit 80% of cases of tubal damage and 25% of unexplained infertility--that is, 18% of all cases, representing up to 216 new cases each year per million of the total population.
targeted genomic integration of a selectable floxed dual fluorescence reporter in human embryonic stem cells we have used transient transfections in mm14 skeletal muscle cells, newborn rat primary ventricular myocardiocytes, and nonmuscle cells to characterize regulatory elements of the mouse muscle creatine kinase (mck) gene. deletion analysis of mck 5'-flanking sequence reveals a striated muscle-specific, positive regulatory region between -1256 and -1020. a 206-bp fragment from this region acts as a skeletal muscle enhancer and confers orientation-dependent activity in myocardiocytes. a 110-bp enhancer subfragment confers high-level expression in skeletal myocytes but is inactive in myocardiocytes, indicating that skeletal and cardiac muscle mck regulatory sites are distinguishable. to further delineate muscle regulatory sequences, we tested six sites within the mck enhancer for their functional importance. mutations at five sites decrease expression in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and nonmuscle cells. mutations at two of these sites, left e box and mef2, cause similar decreases in all three cell types. mutations at three sites have larger effects in muscle than nonmuscle cells; an a/t-rich site mutation has a pronounced effect in both striated muscle types, mutations at the mef1 (right e-box) site are relatively specific to expression in skeletal muscle, and mutations at the carg site are relatively specific to expression in cardiac muscle. changes at the ap2 site tend to increase expression in muscle cells but decrease it in nonmuscle cells. in contrast to reports involving cotransfection of 10t1/2 cells with plasmids expressing the myogenic determination factor myod, we show that the skeletal myocyte activity of multimerized mef1 sites is 30-fold lower than that of the 206-bp enhancer. thus, myod binding sites alone are not sufficient for high-level expression in skeletal myocytes containing endogenous levels of myod and other myogenic determination factors.
efficient detection and localization on graph structured data personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc.) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. first, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation.  in this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks.  the contributions of this work are three-fold. first, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic. finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a yahoo! front page today module dataset containing over 33 million events. results showed a 12.5% click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.

differentially private maximal frequent sequence mining sequential data is being increasingly used in a variety of applications. publishing sequential data is of vital importance to the advancement of these applications. however, as shown by the re-identification attacks on the aol and netflix datasets, releasing sequential data may pose considerable threats to individual privacy. recent research has indicated the failure of existing sanitization techniques to provide claimed privacy guarantees. it is therefore urgent to respond to this failure by developing new schemes with provable privacy guarantees. differential privacy is one of the only models that can be used to provide such guarantees. due to the inherent sequentiality and high-dimensionality, it is challenging to apply differential privacy to sequential data. in this paper, we address this challenge by employing a variable-length n-gram model, which extracts the essential information of a sequential database in terms of a set of variable-length n-grams. our approach makes use of a carefully designed exploration tree structure and a set of novel techniques based on the markov assumption in order to lower the magnitude of added noise. the published n-grams are useful for many purposes. furthermore, we develop a solution for generating a synthetic database, which enables a wider spectrum of data analysis tasks. extensive experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
online automatic post-editing across domains if two translation systems differ differ in performance on a test set, can we trust that this indicates a difference in true system quality? to answer this question, we describe bootstrap resampling methods to compute statistical significance of test results, and validate them on the concrete example of the bleu score. even for small test sizes of only 300 sentences, our methods may give us assurances that test result differences are real.
differential effects on natural reward processing in rats after repeated heroin we tested the hypothesis that sensitization to heroin enhances appetitive motivational processes involving food reward. in experiment 1, sixteen rats were exposed to positive pairings of a light stimulus and food for 4 consecutive daily sessions. then, the rats received either saline or heroin (2 mg/kg) injections before placement in activity monitors for 9 consecutive daily sessions. rats were then tested in operant conditioning chambers where one lever produced the light stimulus previously paired with food and another lever produced a tone stimulus not paired with anything. heroin produced both significant progressive increases in locomotor activity (sensitization) and significantly enhanced conditioned reinforcement of instrumental lever pressing by the food-associated stimulus. in experiment 2, thirty-two rats were given pavlovian discrimination training in a conditioned magazine approach task where one stimulus was associated with food and a second unpaired with food. rats then received repeated saline or heroin injections as in experiment 1, before being tested under extinction conditions with the two stimuli without the drug. chronic heroin had no effect on performance in this test, but it facilitated learning of the reversed discrimination in a subsequent phase. these data suggest that sensitization to heroin enhances appetitive motivational processes involving food reward.
conditioned h-reflex increase persists after transection of the main corticospinal tract in rats. spinal cord function is normally influenced by descending activity from supraspinal structures. when injury removes or distorts this influence, function changes and spasticity and other disabling problems eventually appear. understanding how descending activity affects spinal cord function could lead to new means for inducing, guiding, and assessing recovery after injury. in this study, we investigated the short-term and medium-term effects of spinal cord bilateral dorsal column (dc), unilateral (ipsilateral) lateral column (lc), bilateral dorsal column ascending tract (da), or bilateral dorsal column corticospinal tract (cst) transection at vertebral level t8-t9 on the soleus h-reflex in freely moving rats. data were collected continuously for 10-20 days before and for 20-155 days after bilateral dc (13 rats), da (10 rats), cst (eight rats), or ipsilateral lc (seven rats) transection. histological examination showed that transections were 98(+/- 3 sd)% complete for dc rats, 80(+/- 20)% complete for lc rats, 91(+/- 13 sd)% complete for da rats, and 95(+/-13)% complete for cst rats. lc, cst, and da transections produced an immediate (i.e., first-day) increase in h-reflex amplitude. lc transection also produced a small decrease in background activity in the first few posttransection days. other than this small decrease, none of the transections produced evidence for the phenomenon of spinal shock. for all transections, all measures returned to or neared pretransection values within 2 weeks. da and lc transections were associated with modest increase in h-reflex amplitude 1-3 months after transection. these medium-term effects must be taken into account when assessing transection effects on operant conditioning of the h-reflex. at the same time, the results are consistent with other evidence that, while h-reflex rate dependence and h-reflex operant conditioning are sensitive measures of spinal cord injury, the h-reflex itself is not.
the use of mood disorder questionnaire, hypomania checklist-32 and clinical predictors for screening previously unrecognised bipolar disorder in a general psychiatric setting background recent community and clinical epidemiological studies have indicated that bipolar spectrum disorder (bsd) is a common illness. no community-based epidemiological study of bsd has been conducted in chinese and other asian populations.   method a random sample of 3016 chinese adults underwent a telephone-based community survey that examined their twelve-month prevalences of bsd, sociodemographic characteristics, level of distress, and role impairment using the sheehan disability scale. bipolar i disorder (bp-i) and bipolar ii disorder (bp-ii) were based on dsm-iv criteria. soft bipolar ii disorder (soft bp-ii) fulfilled the dsm-iv criteria of major depressive episode and hypomanic episode except that the hypomanic/manic symptoms lasted two to three days.   results the lifetime prevalences of manic episode, hypomanic episode, and soft hypomanic episode were 2.2%, 2.2%, and 10.7% respectively. the twelve-month prevalences of bp-i, bp-ii, and soft bp-ii were 1.4%, 0.5%, and 1.8%, respectively. respondents with bsd were more likely to be female, younger, and single than those without. impairment and distress associated with depressive symptoms were similar across the three groups of bipolar disorders, but those associated with manic/hypomanic symptoms were more severe among respondents with bp-i than bp-ii and soft bp-ii. the number of manic/hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms did not differ across the three bipolar groups.   limitation structured interview questions based on core dsm-iv mood symptoms might under-estimate hypomania. detailed sociodemographic information was not available.   conclusion bsd was common among chinese people in hong kong and exhibited an epidemiological profile comparable to that of western societies.
comparative epigenomics in the brassicaceae reveals two evolutionarily conserved modes of prc2-mediated gene regulation we report the 207-mb genome sequence of the north american arabidopsis lyrata strain mn47 based on 8.3× dideoxy sequence coverage. we predict 32,670 genes in this outcrossing species compared to the 27,025 genes in the selfing species arabidopsis thaliana. the much smaller 125-mb genome of a. thaliana, which diverged from a. lyrata 10 million years ago, likely constitutes the derived state for the family. we found evidence for dna loss from large-scale rearrangements, but most of the difference in genome size can be attributed to hundreds of thousands of small deletions, mostly in noncoding dna and transposons. analysis of deletions and insertions still segregating in a. thaliana indicates that the process of dna loss is ongoing, suggesting pervasive selection for a smaller genome. the high-quality reference genome sequence for a. lyrata will be an important resource for functional, evolutionary and ecological studies in the genus arabidopsis.
advanced symbolic analysis for compilers in the past three years, the perfect benchmarktm suite has evolved from a supercomputer performance evaluation plan, presented by kuck and sameh at the 1987 international conference on supercomputing, to a vigorous international activity. this paper surveys the current state of this supercomputer performance evaluation effort with particular focus on the adopted methodology. while there has been considerable success in achieving the goals of the plan, some issues remain unresolved, and new questions have surfaced.
altered oscillation and synchronization of default-mode network activity in mild alzheimer’s disease compared to mild cognitive impairment: an electrophysiological study we have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, eeglab, running under the crossplatform matlab environment (the mathworks, inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged eeg data of any number of channels. available functions include eeg data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial erp-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ica) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. eeglab functions are organized into three layers. top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use matlab syntax. menu options allow users to tune the behavior of eeglab to available memory. middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. experienced matlab users can use eeglab data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. extensive function help and tutorial information are included. a 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new eeg modules into the main menu. eeglab is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the gnu public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.
long-term quality of life after living kidney donation. the short form-12 health survey (sf-12) is used to assess the patient's quality of life (qol) using the physical component score (pcs) and the mental component score (mcs). the purpose of this study was to determine whether the sf-12 pcs and mcs are associated with psoriasis severity and to compare qol between murdough family center for psoriasis (mfcp) patients and patients with other major chronic diseases included in the national survey of functional health status data. we used data from 429 adult patients enrolled in mfcp. psoriasis area severity index (pasi) was used to assess psoriasis severity at the time of completion of the sf-12 questionnaire. other variables included age, sex, body mass index, psoriatic arthritis, psychiatric disorders, and comorbidities. linear regression models were used to estimate effect sizes ± 95% confidence intervals. for every 10-point increase in pasi, there was a 1.1 ± 1.3 unit decrease in mcs (p=0.100) and a 2.4 ± 1.3 unit decrease in pcs (p<0.001). psoriasis severity was associated with pcs and mcs after adjusting for variables, although the strength of the relationship was attenuated in some models. psoriasis severity is associated with decreased qol. sf-12 may be a useful tool for assessing qol among psoriasis patients.
in macrophages, caspase-1 activation by sope and the type iii secretion system-1 of s. typhimurium can proceed in the absence of flagellin we have identified two novel salmonella typhimurium genes, invf and invg, which are required for the efficient entry of these organisms into cultured epithelial cells. invf and invg are located immediately upstream of inve, a previously identified gene also required for salmonella entry. non‐polar mutations in these genes rendered s. typhimurium severely deficient for entry into cultured epithelial cells. the nucleotide sequences of invf and invg indicated that these genes encode polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 24373 and 62275, respectively. proteins of similar sizes were observed when invf and invg were expressed in a bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase‐based expression system. comparison of the predicted sequence of invf with translated sequences in the existing databases indicated that this protein is homologous to members of the arac family of prokaryotic transcription regulators. however, mutations in invf did not significantly affect the expression of other members of the inv locus. invg was found to be homologous to members of the puid family of specialized translocases. this homology suggests that invg may be necessary for the export of invasion‐related determinants or involved in the assembly of a supramolecular structure that promotes entry.
expression analysis and in silico characterization of intronic long noncoding rnas in renal cell carcinoma: emerging functional associations background both the validity and the reproducibility of microarray-based clinical research have been challenged. there is a need for critical review of the statistical analysis and reporting in published microarray studies that focus on cancer-related clinical outcomes.   methods studies published through 2004 in which microarray-based gene expression profiles were analyzed for their relation to a clinical cancer outcome were identified through a medline search followed by hand screening of abstracts and full text articles. studies that were eligible for our analysis addressed one or more outcomes that were either an event occurring during follow-up, such as death or relapse, or a therapeutic response. we recorded descriptive characteristics for all the selected studies. a critical review of outcome-related statistical analyses was undertaken for the articles published in 2004.   results ninety studies were identified, and their descriptive characteristics are presented. sixty-eight (76%) were published in journals of impact factor greater than 6. a detailed account of the 42 studies (47%) published in 2004 is reported. twenty-one (50%) of them contained at least one of the following three basic flaws: 1) in outcome-related gene finding, an unstated, unclear, or inadequate control for multiple testing; 2) in class discovery, a spurious claim of correlation between clusters and clinical outcome, made after clustering samples using a selection of outcome-related differentially expressed genes; or 3) in supervised prediction, a biased estimation of the prediction accuracy through an incorrect cross-validation procedure.   conclusions the most common and serious mistakes and misunderstandings recorded in published studies are described and illustrated. based on this analysis, a proposal of guidelines for statistical analysis and reporting for clinical microarray studies, presented as a checklist of "do's and don'ts," is provided.
exploiting saliency for object segmentation from image level labels we study visual attention by detecting a salient object in an input image. we formulate salient object detection as an image segmentation problem, where we separate the salient object from the image background. we propose a set of novel features including multi-scale contrast, center-surround histogram, and color spatial distribution to describe a salient object locally, regionally, and globally. a conditional random field is learned to effectively combine these features for salient object detection. we also constructed a large image database containing tens of thousands of carefully labeled images by multiple users. to our knowledge, it is the first large image database for quantitative evaluation of visual attention algorithms. we validate our approach on this image database, which is public available with this paper.
patterns of human herpesvirus-8 oral shedding among diverse cohorts of human herpesvirus-8 seropositive persons background little is known about the clinical and virologic manifestations of human herpesvirus (hhv)-8 infection in immunocompetent persons in the absence of malignancy.   methods a total of 46 human immunodeficiency virus-negative, hhv-8-seropositive men collected saliva daily, and 25 recorded 15 common symptoms daily (gastrointestinal, constitutional, and oropharyngeal) and absences from work or school. quantitative polymerase chain reaction measured hhv-8 dna in saliva.   results some 44 (96%) of 46 men reported having sex with men (msm). of the 44 msm, 27 (61%) had hhv-8 detected in saliva on > or = 1 day; heterosexual men also shed hhv-8. in analyses restricted to msm, hhv-8 dna was detected on 636 (22%) of 2897 days. among msm with hhv-8 detected in saliva, the median rate was 20% (range, 1%-100%), with 30% shedding on > 50% of days, and the median quantity was 4.5 log10 copies/ml (range, 2.0-7.3 log10 copies/ml). the quantity of hhv-8 shed was lower in nonwhites (p<.001) and younger participants (p=.03). the frequency of hhv-8 detection and quantity were correlated (r=0.62; p<.001). symptoms were reported on 10 (9%) of 114 days when hhv-8 was present, compared with 78 (9%) of 830 days without (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% confidence interval, 0.30-2.88]; p=.9).   conclusions hhv-8 is detected frequently and intermittently in the saliva of chronically infected immunocompetent msm, but this infection is asymptomatic.
fmri dependent components analysis reveals dynamic relations between functional large scale cortical networks events in the world are mediated through multiple sensory inputs which are processed separately in specific unisensory areas according to the division-of-labor principle, and then need to be integrated to create a unified percept. how this is done is still not clear. for instance, recent evidence showed crossmodal activation in primary areas. we developed a novel approach to study multisensory integration using multifrequency spectral analysis to investigate the processing of audio and visual streams in a multisensory context. auditory and visual stimuli were delivered in the same experimental condition, each in different presentation frequencies, and thus could be detected by applying fourier spectral analysis in their different presentation frequencies. the cochleotopic and retinotopic organization of primary auditory and visual areas were found to remain intact in spite of the multisensory context. auditory responses were also found in the precuneus, suggesting that it might be a new auditory area responsive to pure tone stimuli, and serving as one end of a novel sensory preference gradient stretching across pog to the calcarine sulcus. additional audiovisual areal convergence was detected both in areas in the middle of sensory preference gradients, and in primary auditory areas. interestingly, the in/out synchronization rate of the auditory and visual streams yielded a third interaction frequency, which could be analyzed independently to reveal higher-order audiovisual interaction responses. these results were detected in one compact and natural multisensory experimental condition, which has several advantages over previous approaches. the method can be further implemented to study any type of interaction, within and across sensory modalities.
the rewarding effects of ethanol are modulated by binge eating of a high-fat diet during adolescence restricting access to high-fat foods is a common strategy utilized to promote health. this strategy may contribute to episodes of overconsumption, however, when the restricted foods subsequently become available. the present study utilized a rat feeding procedure to determine if restricting access to an optional source of dietary fat would increase later consumption of that food under nonenergy-deprived conditions. five groups of male sprague-dawley rats were used, all of which had continuous access to a standard rodent diet and water. the control group had no access to shortening. the low-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening every day. the high-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening on monday, wednesday, and friday. two additional groups were switched between the high and low conditions. two-hour and 24-h food intakes were measured every day for 6 weeks. at the end of the study rats were sacrificed and carcass composition determined. as access to the shortening decreased, consumption during the 2-h access period increased. rats compensated for the increased shortening consumption by decreasing intake of the standard diet. thus, cumulative energy consumption did not differ among the groups. when switched between the high and low conditions, rats rapidly adjusted to the change in shortening availability. there were no effects of access schedule on carcass composition. these results indicate that restricting access to an optional high-fat food, even under nonenergy-deprived conditions, can promote significant increases in the consumption of that food when it subsequently becomes available.
salesforce behavioural performance of accounts relationship managers (arms) in uganda's commercial banks: a qualitative analysis we introduce social networks theory and methods as a way of understanding mentoring in the current career context. we iirst introduce a typology of “developmental networks” using core concepts from social networks theory—network diversity and tie strength—to view mentoring as a multiple relationship phenomenon. we then propose a framework illustrating factors that shape developmental network structures and offer propositions focusing on the developmental consequences for individuals having different types of developmental networks in their careers. we conclude with strategies both for testing our propositions and for researching multiple developmental relationships further.
decreased lamina cribrosa beam thickness and pore diameter relative to distance from the central retinal vessel trunk we demonstrate an automated segmentation method for in-vivo 3d optical coherence tomography (oct) imaging of the lamina cribrosa (lc). manual segmentations of coronal slices of the lc were used as a gold standard in parameter selection and evaluation of the automated technique. the method was validated using two prototype oct devices; each had a subject cohort including both healthy and glaucomatous eyes. automated segmentation of in-vivo 3d lc oct microstructure performed comparably to manual segmentation and is useful for investigative research and in clinical quantification of the lc.
endothelum-dependent and-independent relaxations in aortic rings obtained from hypertensive hooded (aguti) rats. using the genetic technique of selective inbreeding, it has been possible to quickly develop two statistically separable populations from one unselected strain of sprague-dawley rats. one of these is very sensitive, the other very resistant, to the development of experimental hypertension from a high salt diet. it was suggested that similar genetic factors operate in man.
ubiquinone limits oxidative stress in escherichia coli. superoxide production has been measured in subcellular fractions of sod-deficient escherichia coli provided with physiological reductants. although cytosolic enzyme(s) do generate o2-., the larger portion is produced by autoxidation of components of the respiratory electron-transport chain. at 37 degrees c and with po2, nadh, and nad+ levels matching those in vivo, respiring membrane vesicles generate 3 o2-./10,000 electrons transferred. this corresponds to intracellular o2-. production, in glucose-fed cells, of 5 microm/s. the high sod content of normal cells restricts o2-. accumulation to 2.10(-10) m, with a moderate gradient from the membrane to the center of the cell. sod-deficient mutants achieve a much higher steady-state content of o2-.. rates of superoxide-mediated inactivation of certain enzymes are sufficiently rapid that even 10(-10) m o2-. imposes a significant oxidative stress.
how different medical school selection processes call upon different personality characteristics this study was conducted to: (i) analyse whether students admitted to one medical school based on top pre‐university grades, a voluntary multifaceted selection process, or lottery, respectively, differed in study performance; (ii) examine whether students who were accepted in the multifaceted selection process outperformed their rejected peers, and (iii) analyse whether participation in the multifaceted selection procedure was related to performance.
crystal structure of arabidopsis cyclophilin38 reveals a previously uncharacterized immunophilin fold and a possible autoinhibitory mechanism[w] potassium (k+) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. plants often adapt to low k+ conditions by increasing their k+ uptake capability. recent studies have led to the identification of a calcium signaling pathway that enables plants to act in this capacity. calcium is linked to two calcineurin b-like calcium sensors (cbls) and a target kinase (cbl-interacting protein kinase 23 or cipk23) that, in turn, appears to phosphorylate and activate the potassium channel, arabidopsis k+ transporter 1 (akt1), responsible for k+ uptake in roots. here, we report evidence that this regulatory mechanism is more elaborate than earlier envisaged. the recently described pathway is part of an extensive network whereby several cbls interact with multiple cipks in the activation of the potassium channel, akt1. the physical interactions among the cbl, cipk, and akt1 components provide a mechanism for specifying the members of the cbl and cipk families functional in akt1 regulation. the interaction between the cipks and akt1 was found to involve the kinase domain of the cipk component and the ankyrin repeat domain of the channel. furthermore, we identified a 2c-type protein phosphatase that physically interacts and inactivates the akt1 channel. these findings provide evidence that the calcium-sensitive cbl and cipk families together with 2c-type protein phosphatases form a protein phoshporylation/dephosphorylation network that regulates the akt1 channel for k+ transport in plants.
aberrant otx2 expression enhances migration and induces ectopic proliferation of hindbrain neuronal progenitor cells math1 is a bhlh transcription factor expressed in neural progenitor cells in multiple regions of the nervous system. previously we identified a math1 enhancer that directs expression of reporter genes in a math1 specific pattern [development 127 (2000) 1185]. we have used a portion of this enhancer to drive expression of a nuclear gfp reporter in the math1 lineage in transgenic mice. in this transgenic mouse strain, gfp is expressed in math1 domains in the (1). developing spinal cord in progenitors to di1 dorsal interneurons, (2). granule-cell progenitors in the developing cerebellum, (3). merkel cells in the skin, and (4). hair cells in the developing vestibular and auditory systems. furthermore, non-math1 related expression is detected that is likely due to the absence of inhibitory regulatory sequences from the transgene. these expression domains include (1). the apical ectodermal ridge in developing limbs, (2). post-mitotic cells in the developing cortex and spinal cord, (3). the dentate gyrus, (4). retina, and (5). olfactory epithelium. because gfp marks specific neuronal cell types in living tissue, this transgenic strain is a powerful tool for future studies on the development and electrophysiological properties of distinct cell types in the central nervous system and in sensory systems.
tomogc: binary tomography by constrained graphcuts discrete tomography deals with the reconstruction of images from their projections where the images are assumed to contain only a small number of grey values. in particular, there is a strong focus on the reconstruction of binary images (binary tomography). a variety of binary tomography problems have been considered in the literature, each using different projection models or additional constraints. in this paper, we propose a generic iterative reconstruction algorithm that can be used for many different binary reconstruction problems. in every iteration, a subproblem is solved based on at most two of the available projections. each of the subproblems can be solved efficiently using network flow methods. we report experimental results for various reconstruction problems. our results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of reconstructing complex objects from a small number of projections.
prevalence of ptsd in survivors of stroke and transient ischemic attack: a meta-analytic review objective to develop two checklists for the quality of observational studies of incidence or risk factors of diseases.   study design and setting initial development of the checklists was based on a systematic literature review. the checklists were refined after pilot trials of validity and reliability were conducted by seven experts, who tested the checklists on 10 articles.   results the checklist for studies of incidence or prevalence of chronic disease had six criteria for external validity and five for internal validity. the checklist for risk factor studies had six criteria for external validity, 13 criteria for internal validity, and two aspects of causality. a microsoft access database produced automated standardized reports about external and internal validities. pilot testing demonstrated face and content validities and discrimination of reporting vs. methodological qualities. interrater agreement was poor. the experts suggested future reliability testing of the checklists in systematic reviews with preplanned protocols, a priori consensus about research-specific quality criteria, and training of the reviewers.   conclusion we propose transparent and standardized quality assessment criteria of observational studies using the developed checklists. future testing of the checklists in systematic reviews is necessary to develop reliable tools that can be used with confidence.
combining fully convolutional and recurrent neural networks for 3d biomedical image segmentation the goal of connectomics is to manifest the interconnections of neural system with the electron microscopy (em) images. however, the formidable size of em image data renders human annotation impractical, as it may take decades to fulfill the whole job. an alternative way to reconstruct the connectome can be attained with the computerized scheme that can automatically segment the neuronal structures. the segmentation of em images is very challenging as the depicted structures can be very diverse. to address this difficult problem, a deep contextual network is proposed here by leveraging multi-level contextual information from the deep hierarchical structure to achieve better segmentation performance. to further improve the robustness against the vanishing gradients and strengthen the capability of the back-propagation of gradient flow, auxiliary classifiers are incorporated in the architecture of our deep neural network. it will be shown that our method can effectively parse the semantic meaning from the images with the underlying neural network and accurately delineate the structural boundaries with the reference of low-level contextual cues. experimental results on the benchmark dataset of 2012 isbi segmentation challenge of neuronal structures suggest that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with respect to different evaluation measurements. our method can potentially facilitate the automatic connectome analysis from em images with less human intervention effort.
improved cbp neural network model with applications in time series prediction this letter proves the equivalence between vector quantization (vq) classifiers and circular backpropagation (cbp) networks. the calibrated prototypes for a vq schema can be plugged in a cbp feedforward structure having the same number of hidden neurons and featuring the same mapping. the letter describes how to exploit such equivalence by using vq prototypes to perform a meaningful initialization for bp optimization. the approach effectiveness was tested considering a real classification problem (nist handwritten digits).
a multisource approach to improving epidemiologic estimates: application to global b-cell malignancies knowledge of the incidence of cancer is a fundamental requirement of rational planning and monitoring of cancer control programs. the lack of national-level information systems on health indicators in china means that estimation methods are required. estimates and projections of national level cancer mortality have been previously made using sample surveys of deaths. using these mortality data, incidence rates in 2000 and 2005 were estimated by means of the ratio of cancer cases/deaths (by site, age, and sex) in good quality cancer registries in china. a total of 2.1 million cancer cases were estimated for the year 2000 (1.3 million in men, 0.8 million in women), with the most common sites being lung, liver, and stomach in men, and breast, lung, and stomach in women. the total number of new cases is expected to increase by 14.6% by 2005, primarily as a result of population growth and aging. in addition, the rising rates of lung cancer incidence (in both sexes) and breast cancer mean that there will be much greater increases in the number of cases at these two sites (27% for lung cancer in men, 38% for lung and breast cancer in women). these two cancers are now the priorities for cancer prevention, early detection, and therapy in china.
inhibition of phospholipase a2 activity reduces membrane fluidity in rat hippocampus we have determined the concentration of free fatty acids in membranes of slices prepared from the dentate gyrus following the induction of long-term potentiation in the anaesthetized rat. compared to unpotentiated tissue, there was a significant increase in the concentration of free arachidonic acid 2.5 min, 45 min and 3 h after induction of long-term potentiation. there was no corresponding increase in oleic, stearic or palmitic acids. to account for the increase in free arachidonate, the activities of phospholipase a2, phospholipase a1 and phospholipase c were determined at the same three time intervals in control and potentiated tissue. two-and-a-half minutes after the induction of long-term potentiation, activity of phospholipase a2 was enhanced, while at 45 min, and at 3 h phospholipase c activity was increased. these results suggest that the liberation of free arachidonate is due initially to phospholipase a2 activity, but that at later stages of long-term potentiation, control switches to phospholipase c. subcellular fractionation experiments revealed an increase in free arachidonate in the postsynaptic density fraction 45 min after induction of long-term potentiation, without significant changes in synaptosomal- or glial-enriched fractions. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that arachidonic acid, released from a postsynaptic site, acts as a trophic retrograde synaptic signal in long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus.
hmga proteins promote atm expression and enhance cancer cell resistance to genotoxic agents the high mobility group hmga1 protein belongs to a family of architectural factors that play a role in chromosomal organisation and gene transcription regulation. hmga1 overexpression represents a common feature of human malignant tumours and is causally associated with neoplastic transformation and metastatic progression. recently, hmga1 expression has been correlated with the presence of chromosomal rearrangements and suggested to promote genomic instability. here, we report a novel interaction between hmga1 protein and the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) kinase, the major key player in the cellular response to dna damage caused by several agents such as ionising radiation (ir). we identified an sq motif on hmga1, which is effectively phosphorylated by atm in vitro and in vivo. interestingly, confocal microscopy revealed that hmga1 colocalises with the activated form of atm (atm s1981p). moreover, hmga1 ectopic expression decreases cell survival following exposure to ir as assessed by clonogenic survival in mcf-7 cells, further supporting the hypothesis that hmga1 might act as a downstream target of the atm pathway in response to dna damage.
abnormal sperm morphology in mouse germ cells after short-term exposures to acetamiprid, propineb, and their mixture thiacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, is widely used for controlling various species of pests on many crops. the potential genotoxic effects of thiacloprid on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls) were investigated in vitro by the chromosome aberrations (cas), sister chromatid exchanges (sces), and cytokinesis‐block micronucleus (mn) assays. the human pbls were treated with 75, 150, and 300 μg/ml thiacloprid in the absence and presence of an exogenous metabolic activator (s9 mix). thiacloprid increased the cas and sces significantly at all concentrations (75, 150, and 300 μg/ml) both in the absence and presence of the s9 mix and induced a significant increase in mn and nucleoplasmic bridge formations at all concentrations for 24 h and at 75 and 150 μg/ml for 48‐h treatment periods in the absence of the s9 mix; and at all concentrations in the presence of the s9 mix when compared with the control and solvent control. thiacloprid was also found to significantly induce nuclear bud (nbud) formation at 300 μg/ml for 24 h and at 150 μg/ml for 48‐h treatment times in the absence of the s9 mix and at the two highest concentrations (150 and 300 μg/ml) in the presence of the s9 mix. thiacloprid significantly decreased the mitotic index, proliferation index, and nuclear division index for all concentrations both in the absence and presence of the s9 mix. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc. environ toxicol 29: 631–641, 2014.
treedom: a graphical web tool for analysing domain architecture evolution motivation multi-domain proteins have evolved by insertions or deletions of distinct protein domains. tracing the history of a certain domain combination can be important for functional annotation of multi-domain proteins, and for understanding the function of individual domains. in order to analyze the evolutionary history of the domains in modular proteins it is desirable to inspect a phylogenetic tree based on sequence divergence with the modular architecture of the sequences superimposed on the tree.   result a java applet, nifas, that integrates graphical domain schematics for each sequence in an evolutionary tree was developed. nifas retrieves domain information from the pfam database and uses clustal w to calculate a tree for a given pfam domain. the tree can be displayed with symbolic bootstrap values, and to allow the user to focus on a part of the tree, the layout can be altered by swapping nodes, changing the outgroup, and showing/collapsing subtrees. nifas is integrated with the pfam database and is accessible over the internet (http://www.cgr.ki.se/pfam). as an example, we use nifas to analyze the evolution of domains in protein kinases c.

leishmania braziliensis replication protein a subunit 1: molecular modelling, protein expression and analysis of its affinity for both dna and rna the iterative threading assembly refinement (i-tasser) server is an integrated platform for automated protein structure and function prediction based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm. starting from an amino acid sequence, i-tasser first generates three-dimensional (3d) atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations. the function of the protein is then inferred by structurally matching the 3d models with other known proteins. the output from a typical server run contains full-length secondary and tertiary structure predictions, and functional annotations on ligand-binding sites, enzyme commission numbers and gene ontology terms. an estimate of accuracy of the predictions is provided based on the confidence score of the modeling. this protocol provides new insights and guidelines for designing of online server systems for the state-of-the-art protein structure and function predictions. the server is available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/i-tasser.
synergistic effect of anti-angiogenic and radiation therapy: quantitative evaluation with dynamic contrast enhanced mr imaging dynamic mr imaging can be used to study tissue perfusion and vascular permeability. in the present article a procedure for dynamic mr is presented, which (a) accurately resolves the fast kinetics of tissue response during and after intravenous infusion of the paramagnetic contrast medium gd-dtpa and (b) yields a linear relationship between the measured mr signal and the gd-dtpa concentration in the tissue. according to these features, the measured signal-time curves can be analyzed within the framework of pharmacokinetic modeling. tissue response has been parameterized using a linear two-compartment open model, with only negligible effects of the peripheral compartment on the central compartment. the three model parameters were fitted to the signal-time data pixel by pixel, based on a set of 64 rapid se images (se 100/10 ms, image scan time 13 s, interscan intervals 11 s). this makes it possible to construct parameter images, whereby structures become visible that cannot be distinguished in conventional gd-dtpa enhanced mr. as a clinical example, the approach is discussed in a case of glioblastoma.
the fast changing landscape of sequencing technologies and their impact on microbial genome assemblies and annotation backgroundthe quality of automated gene prediction in microbial organisms has improved steadily over the past decade, but there is still room for improvement. increasing the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false positives, are all desirable goals.resultswith our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the joint genome institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called prodigal (prokaryotic dynamic programming gene-finding algorithm). with prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. we compared the results of prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives.conclusionwe built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.
the relative position priming effect depends on whether letters are vowels or consonants. we report four experiments investigating the effects of repeated and transposed letters in orthographic processing. orthographically related primes were formed by removing one letter from the target word, by transposing two adjacent letters, or by replacing two adjacent letters with different letters. robust masked priming in a lexical decision task was found for primes formed by removing a single letter (e.g., mircle-miracle), and this was not influenced by whether or not the prime contained a letter repetition (e.g., balace vs. balnce as a prime for balance ). target words containing a repeated letter tended to be harder to respond to than words without a letter repetition, but the nonwords formed by removing a repeated letter (e.g., balnce) were no harder to reject than nonwords formed by removing a non-repeated letter (e.g., mircle, balace). significant transposition priming effects were found for 7-letter words (e.g., sevrice-service), and these priming effects did not vary as a function of the position of the transposition (initial, final, or inner letter pair). priming effects disappeared when primes were formed by replacing the two transposed letters with different letters (e.g., sedlice-service), and five-letter words only showed priming effects with inner letter transpositions (e.g., ponit-point). we present a revised “open-bigram” scheme for letter position coding that accounts for these data.
rosetta flexpepdock ab-initio: simultaneous folding, docking and refinement of peptides onto their receptors a two-stage neural network has been used to predict protein secondary structure based on the position specific scoring matrices generated by psi-blast. despite the simplicity and convenience of the approach used, the results are found to be superior to those produced by other methods, including the popular phd method according to our own benchmarking results and the results from the recent critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction experiment (casp3), where the method was evaluated by stringent blind testing. using a new testing set based on a set of 187 unique folds, and three-way cross-validation based on structural similarity criteria rather than sequence similarity criteria used previously (no similar folds were present in both the testing and training sets) the method presented here (psipred) achieved an average q3 score of between 76.5% to 78.3% depending on the precise definition of observed secondary structure used, which is the highest published score for any method to date. given the success of the method in casp3, it is reasonable to be confident that the evaluation presented here gives a fair indication of the performance of the method in general.
disease resistance in the drywood termite, incisitermes schwarzi: does nesting ecology affect immunocompetence? abstract the benefit of sociality in relation to disease susceptibility was studied in the dampwood termite zootermopsis angusticollis. although contact with high concentrations of fungal conidia is lethal, the survivorship of nymphs exposed to spore suspensions ranging from 6 × 106 to 2 × 108 spores/ml of the fungus metarhizium anisopliae increased with group size. the survivorship (measured as lt50) of isolated individuals ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 days, but infected nymphs living in groups of 10 and 25 individuals survived significantly longer (5.6–8.3 and 5.6–9.1 days, respectively). in most cases, there were no significant differences in the survival distributions of the 10- and 25-termite groups. when nymphs were infected with concentrations of 7 × 101–7 × 104 spores/ml and allowed to interact with healthy nestmates, fungal infections were not contracted by the unexposed termites. moreover, infected termites benefitted from social contact with unexposed nestmates: their survival rates were significantly higher than those of infected termites living with similarly infected nestmates. allogrooming, which increased in frequency during and after exposure to conidia, appeared to remove potentially infectious spores from the cuticle, thus increasing termite survivorship. these results suggest that allogrooming plays a crucial role in the control of disease and its death hazard in termites. the infection-reducing advantage of group living may have been significant in the evolution of social behavior in the isoptera.
“both sides of the wheelchair”: the views of individuals with, and parents of individuals with friedreich ataxia regarding pre-symptomatic testing of minors thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. in this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. we outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. we then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. we conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.
risk of subsequent myeloid neoplasms after radiotherapy treatment for a solid cancer among adults in the united states, 2000–2014 background: although the number of cancer survivors has increased substantially over the past several decades, the composition of survivors treated with radiotherapy is not well defined. radiotherapy carries unique long-term toxicity risks for cancer survivors. this study describes the current estimates and future projections of the epidemiology of 5-year cancer survivors who receive radiation therapy. methods: we used cancer incidence and survival data from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end-results (seer) database linked to u.s. census data to estimate the number of 5-year cancer survivors treated with radiation between 2000 and 2030. future projections assumed continuing incidence and survival trends based on historical rates. results: in 2016, there were an estimated 3.05 million cancer survivors treated with radiation, accounting for 29% of all cancer survivors. the number of radiation-treated cancer survivors is projected to reach 3.38 million by 2020 and 4.17 million by 2030. in 2016, breast (40%) and prostate cancer (23%) composed the majority of radiation-treated survivors, followed by head and neck cancer (5.8%), lymphoma (5.6%), uterine (3.9%), and rectal cancer (3.8%). the percentage of 70 years or older radiation-treated survivors steadily increased between 2000 and 2030. conclusions: the next several years are projected to see a large increase in the number of cancer survivors treated with radiation. impact: this group of cancer survivors has unique needs given the long-term risks of radiation, and increased research and awareness are required to optimize health of this growing population. cancer epidemiol biomarkers prev; 26(6); 963–70. ©2017 aacr.
high glucose impairs insulin signaling in the glomerulus: an in vitro and ex vivo approach endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress signalling pathways are involved in various alterations of the central nervous system such as neurodegenerative diseases or ischemia. the current mechanisms linking er stress activation to neuronal cell fate upon chronic or acute stresses remain however to be fully understood. recent studies have associated er stress severity and the relative activation levels of certain output pathways to influence cell-fate decisions. in the present report, to further test the impact of er stress severity on neuronal survival, we designed an experimental system recapitulating acute and chronic stress in cerebellar granule neurons (cgns) and c17.2 mouse neural stem cells (nscs). two well characterized er stress inducers, tunicamycin (tm) and dithiothreitol (dtt), were used to induce "slow motion" and "fast motion" stresses, respectively. we show that the duration of jnk activation is critical for cell survival upon er stress. tm-induced transient jnk activation is a protective event in cgns and c17.2 nscs via the phosphorylation of bad, while dtt-induced prolonged jnk activation mediates pro-apoptotic signalling. in addition, we demonstrate that er stress mediated mkp-1/dusp1 expression regulates jnk activation kinetics. mkp-1 phosphorylation and protein expression level are differentially altered upon tm and dtt treatment. increased mkp-1 protein stability via its phosphorylation on ser359 induced by tm accounts for transient jnk activation and the resulting cell survival in cgns and c17.2 nscs subjected to er stress. these results suggest that mkp-1 plays a pivotal role in er stress-induced cell apoptosis through regulating jnk-bad signalling.
identity verification using speech and face information this paper proposes a new approach to speech end-point detection based on cepstral analysis. the algorithm is based on explicit (static) modelling of speech and non-speech, and decisions are made on each incoming (overlapped) cepstral frame, according to model similarity scores. the cepstral analysis provides excellent level-independence, meaning that parameter adjustment , decision thresholds etc, are unnecessary. a high degree of robustness to additive noise is demonstrated, even though the models are static. accurate end-points are recovered with snr levels of 0db.
the impact of cardiac perception on emotion experience and cognitive performance under mental stress heartbeat evoked potentials (hep) were recorded from good and poor heartbeat perceivers under two conditions differing in focus of attention. under the first condition (att), subjects were instructed to count their heartbeats. under the second condition (dis), subjects were distracted from their heartbeats by having them count external tones. electrical brain activity was recorded from 19 electrodes. eeg epochs were triggered by the r wave of the ekg. analyses of variance yielded a significant difference for focus of attention in hep amplitudes at central electrodes (cz, c3, and c4) in the latency range 350-550 msec post r wave. no significant differences occurred between good and poor perceivers. the interaction between the group and condition factors was significant at f4, c4 and t6. the potential map of good perceivers showed a fronto-temporal positivity, which was reduced in poor perceivers. our data suggest that paying attention to an internal event such as the heartbeat can modify the cortical evoked response associated with that event.
inventory of aquatic contaminant flux arising from historical metal mining in england and in regions affected by historic non-coal (principally metal) mining activity, government agencies are often faced with the challenge of deploying limited remedial resources at abandoned mine sites to achieve maximum improvements in the chemical and ecological quality of impacted ground and surface waters. as such, strategies for the defensible allocation of public funds require comprehensive and systematic frameworks by which to identify and prioritise polluting sites for remediation. this paper describes the development and initial findings of such a national initiative in england and wales which allies catchment-scale environmental impact assessments using existing public archive data, with recognition of the uncertainty in impact appraisals arising from disparities in data availability between sites and regions. the methodology identifies polluting sites and takes account not only of the chemical and ecological impacts of mine water discharges on receiving watercourses, but also of socio-economic factors such as conservation and heritage concerns, which can both impede or complement efforts to remediate mine sites. using a geographic information system database and a suite of spatial analyses employing boolean operators, both the extent of the pollution problem from abandoned non-coal mines in england and wales (6% of 7815 surface water bodies are affected nationally) and the insight that can be gleaned from systematic analyses of existing archive data are highlighted. the results of the nationwide survey can be used as a dynamic database to inform future remedial planning, in terms of prioritising impacted river basins and abandoned non-coal mine sites themselves for either remediation or future monitoring efforts. as the assessment framework is built upon existing water quality and ecological data and mine site/geological data, there is considerable scope for the approach to be applied elsewhere where the legacy of historic mining persists through the widespread pollution of the aquatic environment.
towards a balanced view of the bacterial tree of life silva (from latin silva, forest, http://www.arb-silva.de) is a comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality-controlled databases of aligned ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences from the bacteria, archaea and eukaryota domains and supplementary online services. the referred database release 111 (july 2012) contains 3 194 778 small subunit and 288 717 large subunit rrna gene sequences. since the initial description of the project, substantial new features have been introduced, including advanced quality control procedures, an improved rrna gene aligner, online tools for probe and primer evaluation and optimized browsing, searching and downloading on the website. furthermore, the extensively curated silva taxonomy and the new non-redundant silva datasets provide an ideal reference for high-throughput classification of data from next-generation sequencing approaches.
progress against gi cancer during the american society of clinical oncology's first 50 years. background intravenous bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin is the standard adjuvant treatment for colon cancer. the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine is an established alternative to bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. we evaluated capecitabine in the adjuvant setting.   methods we randomly assigned a total of 1987 patients with resected stage iii colon cancer to receive either oral capecitabine (1004 patients) or bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin (mayo clinic regimen; 983 patients) over a period of 24 weeks. the primary efficacy end point was at least equivalence in disease-free survival; the primary safety end point was the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxic effects due to fluoropyrimidines.   results disease-free survival in the capecitabine group was at least equivalent to that in the fluorouracil-plus-leucovorin group (in the intention-to-treat analysis, p<0.001 for the comparison of the upper limit of the hazard ratio with the noninferiority margin of 1.20). capecitabine improved relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99; p=0.04) and was associated with significantly fewer adverse events than fluorouracil plus leucovorin (p<0.001).   conclusions oral capecitabine is an effective alternative to intravenous fluorouracil plus leucovorin in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer.
multi-view descriptor mining via codeword net for action recognition action recognition on large categories of unconstrained videos taken from the web is a very challenging problem compared to datasets like kth (6 actions), ixmas (13 actions), and weizmann (10 actions). challenges like camera motion, different viewpoints, large interclass variations, cluttered background, occlusions, bad illumination conditions, and poor quality of web videos cause the majority of the state-of-the-art action recognition approaches to fail. also, an increased number of categories and the inclusion of actions with high confusion add to the challenges. in this paper, we propose using the scene context information obtained from moving and stationary pixels in the key frames, in conjunction with motion features, to solve the action recognition problem on a large (50 actions) dataset with videos from the web. we perform a combination of early and late fusion on multiple features to handle the very large number of categories. we demonstrate that scene context is a very important feature to perform action recognition on very large datasets. the proposed method does not require any kind of video stabilization, person detection, or tracking and pruning of features. our approach gives good performance on a large number of action categories; it has been tested on the ucf50 dataset with 50 action categories, which is an extension of the ucf youtube action (ucf11) dataset containing 11 action categories. we also tested our approach on the kth and hmdb51 datasets for comparison.
favorable effects of explanatory illustrations attached to a self-administered questionnaire for upper extremity disorders backgroundthe disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (dash) questionnaire is a region-specific self-administered questionnaire that consists of a disability/symptom (dash-ds) scale, and two optional modules, the work (dash-w) and the sport/music (dash-sm) modules. the dash was cross-culturally adapted and developed by the impairment evaluation committee, japanese society for surgery of the hand. the purpose of this study was to test the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the japanese version of dash (dash-jssh).methodsa series of 72 patients with upper extremity disorders completed the dash-jssh, the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey (sf-36), and the visual analog scale (vas) for pain. thirty-eight of the patients were reassessed for test-retest reliability 1 or 2 weeks later. reliability was investigated by reproducibility and internal consistency. to analyze the validity, a principal component analysis and correlation coefficients between the dash-jssh and the sf-36 were obtained. responsiveness was examined by calculating the standardized response mean (mean change/sd) and effect size (mean change/sd of baseline value) after carpal tunnel release of the 17 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.resultscronbach’s alpha coefficients in the dash-ds and dash-w were 0.962 and 0.967, respectively. the intraclass correlation coefficients for the same were 0.82 and 0.85, respectively. the unidimensionality of the dash-ds and dash-w were confirmed. the correlations between the dash-ds score and the subscale of the sf-36 scale ranged from −0.29 to −0.73. the correlation coefficient between the dash-ds and the dash-w was 0.79. the standardized response mean/effect size of dash-ds, dash-w, and vas for pain were −0.48/−0.26, −0.68/−0.41, and −0.40/−0.40, respectively. dash-ds and dash-w were as moderately sensitive as vas for pain.conclusionthe dash-ds and dash-w japanese version have evaluation capacities equivalent to those of the original and other language versions of the dash.
neurocognitive functioning in patients with first-episode schizophrenia interference or inhibition (the terms seem to have been used almost indiscriminately) has been given a large place in experimental literature. the investigation was begun by the physiologists prior to 1890 (bowditch and warren, j. w., 1890) and has been continued to the present, principally by psychologists (lester, 1932). of the numerous studies that have been published during this period only a limited number of the most relevant reports demand our attention here. miinsterberg (1892) studied the inhibiting effects of changes in common daily habits such as opening the door of his room, dipping his pen in ink, and taking his watch out of his pocket. he concluded that a given association can function automatically even though some effect of a previous contrary association remains. m tiller and schumann (1894) discovered that more time was necessary to relearn a series of nonsense syllables if the stimulus syllables had been associated with other syllables in the meantime. from their results they deduced the law of associative inhibition which is quoted by kline (1921, p. 270) as follows: "if a is already connected with b, then it is difficult to connect it with k, b gets in the way." nonsense syllables were also used by shepard and fogelsonger (1913) in a series of experiments in association and inhibition. only three subjects were used in any experiment and the changes introduced to produce the inhibition were so great in many cases as to present novel situations. this latter fact was shown by the introspections. the results showed an increase in time for the response which corresponded roughly to the increase in the complexity of the situation. the only conclusion was stated thus: "we have found then that in acquiring associations there is involved an inhibitory process which is not a mere
methods and query processing techniques abstract a new variation of overlapping b+-trees is presented, which provides efficient indexing of transaction time and keys in a two dimensional key-time space. modification operations (i.e. insertions, deletions and updates) are allowed at the current version, whereas queries are allowed to any temporal version, i.e. either in the current or in past versions. using this structure, snapshot and range-timeslice queries can be answered optimally. however, the fundamental objective of the proposed method is to deliver efficient performance in case of a general pure-key query (i.e. ‘history of a key’). the trade-off is a small increase in time cost for version operations and storage requirements.
abi 1 and pp 2 ca phosphatases are negative regulators of snf 1-related protein kinase 1 signaling in arabidopsis the transient gene expression system using arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts has proven an important and versatile tool for conducting cell-based experiments using molecular, cellular, biochemical, genetic, genomic and proteomic approaches to analyze the functions of diverse signaling pathways and cellular machineries. a well-established protocol that has been extensively tested and applied in numerous experiments is presented here. the method includes protoplast isolation, peg–calcium transfection of plasmid dna and protoplast culture. physiological responses and high-throughput capability enable facile and cost-effective explorations as well as hypothesis-driven tests. the protoplast isolation and dna transfection procedures take 6–8 h, and the results can be obtained in 2–24 h. the cell system offers reliable guidelines for further comprehensive analysis of complex regulatory mechanisms in whole-plant physiology, immunity, growth and development.
analysis of a global reactive transport model and results for the momas benchmark reactive transport models are complex nonlinear partial differential algebraic equations (pdae), coupling the transport engine with the geochemical operator. we propose an efficient and robust global numerical method, based on a method of lines and differential algebraic equations (dae) solvers, combined with a newton method using a powerful sparse linear solver. numerical experiments show the performances of the method. we also propose a unified framework to describe classical methods such as sequential non-iterative approach, sequential iterative approach, direct substitution approach and compare them with our global method.
variability among cucurbitaceae species (melon, cucumber and watermelon) in a genomic region containing a cluster of nbs-lrr genes backgroundadapter trimming is a prerequisite step for analyzing next-generation sequencing (ngs) data when the reads are longer than the target dna/rna fragments. although typically used in small rna sequencing, adapter trimming is also used widely in other applications, such as genome dna sequencing and transcriptome rna/cdna sequencing, where fragments shorter than a read are sometimes obtained because of the limitations of ngs protocols. for the newly emerged nextera long mate-pair (lmp) protocol, junction adapters are located in the middle of all properly constructed fragments; hence, adapter trimming is essential to gain the correct paired reads. however, our investigations have shown that few adapter trimming tools meet both efficiency and accuracy requirements simultaneously. the performances of these tools can be even worse for paired-end and/or mate-pair sequencing.resultsto improve the efficiency of adapter trimming, we devised a novel algorithm, the bit-masked k-difference matching algorithm, which has o(kn) expected time with o(m) space, where k is the maximum number of differences allowed, n is the read length, and m is the adapter length. this algorithm makes it possible to fully enumerate all candidates that meet a specified threshold, e.g. error ratio, within a short period of time. to improve the accuracy of this algorithm, we designed a simple and easy-to-explain statistical scoring scheme to evaluate candidates in the pattern matching step. we also devised scoring schemes to fully exploit the paired-end/mate-pair information when it is applicable. all these features have been implemented in an industry-standard tool named skewer (https://sourceforge.net/projects/skewer). experiments on simulated data, real data of small rna sequencing, paired-end rna sequencing, and nextera lmp sequencing showed that skewer outperforms all other similar tools that have the same utility. further, skewer is considerably faster than other tools that have comparative accuracies; namely, one times faster for single-end sequencing, more than 12 times faster for paired-end sequencing, and 49% faster for lmp sequencing.conclusionsskewer achieved as yet unmatched accuracies for adapter trimming with low time bound.

high-throughput linkage analysis of mutator insertion sites in maize. backgroundgene knockouts are a critical resource for functional genomics. in arabidopsis, comprehensive knockout collections were generated by amplifying and sequencing genomic dna flanking insertion mutants. these flanking sequence tags (fsts) map each mutant to a specific locus within the genome. in maize, fsts have been generated using dna transposons. transposable elements can generate unstable insertions that are difficult to analyze for simple knockout phenotypes. transposons can also generate somatic insertions that fail to segregate in subsequent generations.resultstransposon insertion sites from 106 uniformmu fsts were tested for inheritance by locus-specific pcr. we confirmed 89% of the fsts to be germinal transposon insertions. we found no evidence for somatic insertions within the 11% of insertion sites that were not confirmed. instead, this subset of insertion sites had errors in locus-specific primer design due to incomplete or low-quality genomic sequences. the locus-specific pcr assays identified a knockout of a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that co-segregates with a seed mutant phenotype. the mutant phenotype linked to this knockout generates novel hypotheses about the role for the plastid-localized oxidative pentose phosphate pathway during grain-fill.conclusionwe show that fsts from the uniformmu population identify stable, germinal insertion sites in maize. moreover, we show that these sequence-indexed mutations can be readily used for reverse genetic analysis. we conclude from these data that the current collection of 1,882 non-redundant insertion sites from uniformmu provide a genome-wide resource for reverse genetics.
multi-task learning for extraction of adverse drug reaction mentions from tweets objective social media is an important pharmacovigilance data source for adverse drug reaction (adr) identification. human review of social media data is infeasible due to data quantity, thus natural language processing techniques are necessary. social media includes informal vocabulary and irregular grammar, which challenge natural language processing methods. our objective is to develop a scalable, deep-learning approach that exceeds state-of-the-art adr detection performance in social media.   materials and methods we developed a recurrent neural network (rnn) model that labels words in an input sequence with adr membership tags. the only input features are word-embedding vectors, which can be formed through task-independent pretraining or during adr detection training.   results our best-performing rnn model used pretrained word embeddings created from a large, non-domain-specific twitter dataset. it achieved an approximate match f-measure of 0.755 for adr identification on the dataset, compared to 0.631 for a baseline lexicon system and 0.65 for the state-of-the-art conditional random field model. feature analysis indicated that semantic information in pretrained word embeddings boosted sensitivity and, combined with contextual awareness captured in the rnn, precision.   discussion our model required no task-specific feature engineering, suggesting generalizability to additional sequence-labeling tasks. learning curve analysis showed that our model reached optimal performance with fewer training examples than the other models.   conclusion adr detection performance in social media is significantly improved by using a contextually aware model and word embeddings formed from large, unlabeled datasets. the approach reduces manual data-labeling requirements and is scalable to large social media datasets.
measurement of habitat predictor variables for organism-habitat models using remote sensing and image segmentation this work was undertaken to devise a technique to measure the height of crops in farmland fields through remote sensing. crop height is a useful spatial variable which, when measured by ground-based manual survey, has proven to be an important predictor of bird species population. an airborne scanning laser system capable of measuring topography to a height accuracy of better than 10 cm was used to acquire height data over a region of farmland near oxford, uk. a scanning laser was pulsed from an aircraft at the ground, measuring the time between transmission and receipt of the last significant return signal. differential geographical positioning system (gps) and onboard attitude sensors were combined with these delay times to construct a set of spot heights through the region. crop height was also measured from the ground. pulses were returned from mainly within the crop, rather than predominantly the canopy or ground, so an algorithm to measure the variation of the returned height, after detrending the heights for topography, was developed. a simple relationship was found between the mean crop height and the standard deviation of detrended return heights within a field. this relationship could be used to derive crop height from light detection and ranging (lidar) data with an accuracy better than 10cm.
towards the unsupervised acquisition of discourse relations abstract this paper examines demonstrative pronouns used as deictics to refer to the interpretation of one or more clauses. although this usage is frowned upon in style manuals (for example strunk and white (1959) state that “this. the pronoun this, referring to the complete sense of a preceding sentence or clause, cannot always carry the load and so may produce an imprecise statement”), it is nevertheless very common in written text. handling this usage poses a problem for natural language understanding systems. the solution i propose is based on distinguishing between what can be pointed to and what can be referred to by virtue of pointing. i argue that a restricted set of discourse segments yield what such demonstrative pronouns can point to in the discourse model and a restricted set of what nunberg (1979) has called referring functions yield what they can refer to by virtue of that pointing.
increased incidence of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in england and wales in 2010: multiocus variable number tandem repeat analysis typing and macrolide susceptibility. on november 15, 2004, a cluster of three cases of salmonella thompson infection was registered by the norwegian reference laboratory. in the following days further cases occurred, prompting a case-control study among the first 13 cases and 26 matched controls. by december 31, 21 cases had been reported, with the first onset on october 24. consumption of rucola lettuce (eruca sativa, also known as rocket salad or arugula) (or 8,8 [1,2-infinity]) and mixed salad (or 5,0 [1,0-infinity]) was associated with illness. on november 26, swedish authorities notified the finding of salmonella thompson in rucola lettuce through the eu rapid alert system for food and feed. later, several countries reported finding this and other salmonella serovars and campylobacter in rucola produced in italy. in response to our alert through the international enter-net surveillance network, sweden and england also reported an increase of cases. salmonella thompson isolates from products and patients from several countries showed high similarity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, but some isolates showed significant differences. we think that the outbreak in norway reflected a larger international outbreak caused by rucola imported from one italian producer. findings of other pathogens indicate a massive contamination, possibly caused by irrigation with nonpotable water. rapid international information exchange is invaluable when investigating outbreaks caused by internationally marketed products.
translocation of iris pigment epithelium in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration: long-term results in patients with acute central serous retinopathy (csr), evaluation of visual acuity alone may not represent visual function. in patients with acute csr, visual function may be disturbed by localized scotomas, distortion, and waviness. for the assessment of localized light sensitivity and stability of fixation, patients with csr were evaluated by fundus perimetry with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (slo 101, rodenstock instruments). in all, 21 patients with acute csr and 19 healthy volunteers were included in the study. diagnosis of csr was established by ophthalmoscopy and digital video fluorescein angiography. all patients and volunteers underwent static suprathreshold perimetry with the slo. light sensitivity was quantified by presenting stimuli with different light intensities (intensity, 0-27.9 db above background; size, goldmann iii; wavelength, 633 nm) using an automatic staircase strategy. stimuli were presented with simultaneous real-time monitoring of the retina. fixation stability was quantified by measuring the area encompassing 75% of all points of fixation. light sensitivity was 18-20 db in affected areas, whereas in healthy eyes and outside the affected area, values of 22-24 db were obtained. fixation stability was significantly decreased in the affected eye as compared with normal eyes (33 +/- 12 versus 21 +/- 4 min of arc; p < 0.01). static perimetry with an slo is a useful technique for the assessment of localized light sensitivity and fixation stability in patients with macular disease. this technique could provide helpful information in the management of csr.
photodynamic therapy for actinic keratosis: is the european consensus protocol for daylight pdt superior to conventional protocol for aktilite cl 128 pdt? photodynamic therapy (pdt) is an attractive therapy for non‐melanoma skin cancers including actinic keratoses (aks) because it allows treatment of large areas; it has a high response rate and results in an excellent cosmesis. however, conventional pdt for aks is associated with inconveniently long clinic visits and discomfort during therapy. in this article, we critically review daylight‐mediated pdt, which is a simpler and more tolerable treatment procedure for pdt. we review the effective light dose, efficacy and safety, the need for prior application of sunscreen, and potential clinical scope of daylight‐pdt. three randomized controlled studies have shown that daylight‐mediated pdt is an effective treatment of thin aks. daylight‐mediated pdt is nearly pain‐free and more convenient for both the clinics and patients. daylight‐mediated pdt is especially suited for patients with large field‐cancerized areas, which can easily be exposed to daylight. further investigations are necessary to determine at which time of the year and in which weather conditions daylight‐mediated pdt will be possible in different geographical locations.
hemopoietic and angiogenetic progenitors in healthy athletes: different responses to endurance and maximal exercise. marathon runners show increased circulating cd34+ cell counts and postexercise release of interleukin-6 (il-6), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) and flt3-ligand (bonsignore mr, morici g, santoro a, pegano m, cascio l, bonnano a, abate p, mirabella f, profita m, insalaco g, gioia m, vignola am, majolino i, testa u, and hogg jc. j appl physiol 93: 1691-1697, 2002). in the present study we hypothesized that supramaximal ("all-out") exercise may acutely affect circulating progenitors and reticulocytes and investigated possible mechanisms involved. progenitor release was measured by flow cytometry (n = 20) and clonogenic assays (n = 6) in 20 young competitive rowers (13 m, 7 f, age +/- sd: 17.1 +/- 2.1 yr, peak o2 consumption: 56.5 +/- 11.4 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) at rest and shortly after 1,000 m "all-out." release of reticulocytes, cortisol, muscle enzymes, neutrophil elastase, and several cytokines/growth factors was measured. supramaximal exercise doubled circulating cd34+ cells (rest: 7.6 +/- 3.0, all-out: 16.3 +/- 9.1 cells/mul, p < 0.001), and increased immature reticulocyte fractions; ac133+ cells doubled, suggesting release of angiogenetic precursors. erythrocyte burst forming units and colony forming units for granulocytes-monocytes and all blood series increased postexercise by 3.4-, 5.5-, and 4.8-fold, respectively (p < 0.01 for all). all-out rowing acutely increased plasma cortisol, neutrophil elastase, flt3-ligand, hepatocyte growth factor, vegf, and transforming growth factor-beta1, and decreased erythropoietin; k-ligand, stromal-derived factor-1, il-6, and g-csf were unchanged. therefore, all-out exercise is a physiological stimulus for progenitor release in athletes. release of reticulocytes and proangiogenetic cells and mediators suggests tissue hypoxia as possibly involved in progenitor mobilization.
elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and cardiovascular or all-cause mortality risk in dialysis patients: a meta-analysis rapidly rising global rates of chronic diseases portend a consequent rise in esrd. despite this, kidney disease is not included in the list of noncommunicable diseases (ncds) targeted by the united nations for 25% reduction by year 2025. in an effort to accurately report the trajectory and pattern of global growth of maintenance dialysis, we present the change in prevalence and incidence from 1990 to 2010. data were extracted from the global burden of disease 2010 epidemiologic database. the results are on the basis of an analysis of data from worldwide national and regional renal disease registries and detailed systematic literature review for years 1980-2010. incidence and prevalence estimates of provision of maintenance dialysis from this database were updated using a negative binomial bayesian meta-regression tool for 187 countries. results indicate substantial growth in utilization of maintenance dialysis in almost all world regions. changes in population structure, changes in aging, and the worldwide increase in diabetes mellitus and hypertension explain a significant portion, but not all, of the increase because increased dialysis provision also accounts for a portion of the rise. these findings argue for the importance of inclusion of kidney disease among ncd targets for reducing premature death throughout the world.
a phase i dose-escalation and pharmacokinetic study of enzastaurin and erlotinib in patients with advanced solid tumors anticancer cytotoxic agents go through a process by which their antitumor activity-on the basis of the amount of tumor shrinkage they could generate-has been investigated. in the late 1970s, the international union against cancer and the world health organization introduced specific criteria for the codification of tumor response evaluation. in 1994, several organizations involved in clinical research combined forces to tackle the review of these criteria on the basis of the experience and knowledge acquired since then. after several years of intensive discussions, a new set of guidelines is ready that will supersede the former criteria. in parallel to this initiative, one of the participating groups developed a model by which response rates could be derived from unidimensional measurement of tumor lesions instead of the usual bidimensional approach. this new concept has been largely validated by the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors group and integrated into the present guidelines. this special article also provides some philosophic background to clarify the various purposes of response evaluation. it proposes a model by which a combined assessment of all existing lesions, characterized by target lesions (to be measured) and nontarget lesions, is used to extrapolate an overall response to treatment. methods of assessing tumor lesions are better codified, briefly within the guidelines and in more detail in appendix i. all other aspects of response evaluation have been discussed, reviewed, and amended whenever appropriate.
reduced mitochondrial ca 2 loading and improved functional recovery after ischemia-reperfusion injury in old vs . young guinea pig hearts background ca2+ loading occurs during myocardial reperfusion injury. volatile anesthetics can reduce reperfusion injury. the authors tested whether sevoflurane administered before index ischemia in isolated hearts reduces myoplasmic diastolic and systolic [ca2+] and improves function more so than when sevoflurane is administered on reperfusion. methods four groups of guinea pig hearts were perfused with crystalloid solution (55 mmhg, 37°c): (1) no treatment before 30 min global ischemia and 60 min reperfusion (con); (2) 3.5 vol% sevoflurane administered for 10 min before ischemia (sbi); (3) 3.5 vol% sevoflurane administered for 10 min after ischemia (sai); and (4) 3.5 vol% sevoflurane administered for 10 min before and after ischemia (sbai). phasic myoplasmic diastolic and systolic [ca2+] were measured in the left ventricular free wall with the fluorescence probe indo-1. results ischemia increased diastolic [ca2+] and diastolic left ventricular pressure (lvp). in con hearts, initial reperfusion greatly increased diastolic [ca2+] and systolic [ca2+] and reduced contractility (systolic–diastolic lvp, dlvp/dtmax), relaxation (diastolic lvp, dlvp/dtmin), myocardial oxygen consumption (mvo2), and cardiac efficiency. sbi, sai, and sbai each reduced ventricular fibrillation, attenuated increases in systolic and systolic–diastolic [ca2+], improved contractile and relaxation indices, and increased coronary flow, percent oxygen extraction, mvo2, and cardiac efficiency during 60 min reperfusion compared with con. sbi was more protective than sai, and sbai was generally more protective than sai. conclusions sevoflurane improves postischemic cardiac function while reducing ca2+ loading when it is administered before or after ischemia, but protection is better when it is administered before ischemia. reduced ca2+ loading on reperfusion is likely a result of the anesthetic protective effect.
characterization of transcription factor networks involved in umbilical cord blood cd34+ stem cells-derived erythropoiesis gene-distal enhancers are critical for tissue-specific gene expression, but their genomic determinants within a specific lineage at different stages of development are unknown. here we profile chromatin state maps, transcription factor occupancy, and gene expression profiles during human erythroid development at fetal and adult stages. comparative analyses of human erythropoiesis identify developmental stage-specific enhancers as primary determinants of stage-specific gene expression programs. we find that erythroid master regulators gata1 and tal1 act cooperatively within active enhancers but confer little predictive value for stage specificity. instead, a set of stage-specific coregulators collaborates with master regulators and contributes to differential gene expression. we further identify and validate irf2, irf6, and myb as effectors of an adult-stage expression program. thus, the combinatorial assembly of lineage-specific master regulators and transcriptional coregulators within developmental stage-specific enhancers determines gene expression programs and temporal regulation of transcriptional networks in a mammalian genome.
are compression stockings an effective treatment for orthostatic presyncope? the relationship between aortic flow and pressure is described by a three-element model of the arterial input impedance, including continuous correction for variations in the diameter and the compliance of the aorta (modelflow). we computed the aortic flow from arterial pressure by this model, and evaluated whether, under orthostatic stress, flow may be derived from both an invasive and a non-invasive determination of arterial pressure. in 10 young adults, modelflow stroke volume (mfsv) was computed from both intra-brachial arterial pressure (iap) and non-invasive finger pressure (finap) measurements. for comparison, a computer-controlled series of four thermodilution estimates (thermodilution-determined stroke volume; tdsv) were averaged for the following positions: supine, standing, head-down tilt at 20 degrees (hdt20) and head-up tilt at 30 degrees and 70 degrees (hut30 and hut70 respectively). data from one subject were discarded due to malfunctioning thermodilution injections. a total of 155 recordings from 160 series were available for comparison. the supine tdsv of 113+/-13 ml (mean+/-s.d.) dropped by 40% to 68+/-14 ml during standing, by 24% to 86+/-12 ml during hut30, and by 51% to 55+/-15 ml during hut70. during hdt20, tdsv was 114+/-13 ml. mfsv for iap underestimated tdsv during hdt20 (-6+/-6 ml; p<0.05), but that for finap did not (-4+/-7 ml; not significant). for hut70 and standing, mfsv for iap overestimated tdsv by 11+/-10 ml (hut70; p<0.01) and 12+/-9 ml (standing; p<0.01). however, the offset of mfsv for finap was not significant for either hut70 (3+/-8 ml) or standing (3+/-9 ml). in conclusion, due to orthostasis, changes in the aortic transmural pressure may lead to an offset in mfsv from iap. however, modelflow correctly calculated aortic flow from non-invasively determined finger pressure during orthostasis.
quantitative and functional interrogation of parent-of-origin allelic expression biases in the brain we present a novel pipeline and methodology for simultaneously estimating isoform expression and allelic imbalance in diploid organisms using rna-seq data. we achieve this by modeling the expression of haplotype-specific isoforms. if unknown, the two parental isoform sequences can be individually reconstructed. a new statistical method, mmseq, deconvolves the mapping of reads to multiple transcripts (isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms). our software can take into account non-uniform read generation and works with paired-end reads.

detecting the presence and absence of causal relationships between expression of yeast genes with very few samples genetic analysis of gene expression in a segregating population, which is expression profiled and genotyped at dna markers throughout the genome, can reveal regulatory networks of polymorphic genes. we propose an analysis strategy with several steps: (1) genome-wide qtl analysis of all expression profiles to identify eqtl confidence regions, followed by fine mapping of identified eqtl; (2) identification of regulatory candidate genes in each eqtl region; (3) correlation analysis of the expression profiles of the candidates in any eqtl region with the gene affected by the eqtl to reduce the number of candidates; (4) drawing directional links from retained regulatory candidate genes to genes affected by the eqtl and joining links to form networks; and (5) statistical validation and refinement of the inferred network structure. here, we apply an initial implementation of this strategy to a segregating yeast population. in 65, 7, and 28% of the identified eqtl regions, a single candidate regulatory gene, no gene, or more than one gene was retained in step 3, respectively. overall, 768 putative regulatory links were retained, 331 of which are the strongest candidate links, as they were retained in the expression correlation analysis and were located within or near an eqtl subregion identified by a multimarker analysis separating multiple linked qtl. one or several biological processes were statistically significantly overrepresented in independent network structures or in highly interconnected subnetworks. most of the transcription factors found in the inferred network had a putative regulatory link to only one other gene or exhibited cis-regulation.
a preference-based approach to backbone computation with application to argumentation in this paper we describe pakota, a system implementation that allows for solving enforcement problems over argumentation frameworks. via harnessing boolean satisfiability (sat) and maximum satisfiability (maxsat) solvers, pakota implements algorithms for extension and status enforcement under various central af semantics, covering a range of np-complete—via direct maxsat encodings—and \(\mathrm{\sigma }_{2}^{p}\)-complete—via maxsat-based counterexample-guided abstraction refinement—enforcement problems. we overview the algorithmic approaches implemented in pakota, and describe in detail the system architecture, features, interfaces, and usage of the system. furthermore, we present an empirical evaluation on the impact of the choice of maxsat solvers on the scalability of the system, and also provide benchmark generators for extension and status enforcement.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
the mechanism of decrease in dynamic mitral regurgitation during heart failure treatment: importance of reduction in the regurgitant orifice size. the proximal flow convergence method, a quantitative color doppler flow technique, has been validated recently for calculating regurgitant flow and orifice area. we investigated the potential of the method as a tool to study different pathophysiological mechanisms of mitral valve incompetence by assessing the time course of regurgitant flow and orifice area and analyzed the implications for quantification of mitral regurgitation. methods and resultsfifty-six consecutive patients with mitral regurgitation of different etiologies were studied. the instantaneous regurgitant flow rate q(t) was computed from color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region and divided by the corresponding orifice velocity v(t) to obtain the instantaneous orifice area at). regurgitant stroke volume (rsv) was obtained by integrating q(t). mean regurgitant flow rate qm was calculated by rsv divided by regurgitation time. peak-to-mean regurgitant flow rates qp/qm and orifice areas a(p)/am were calculated to assess the phasic character of qt)and a(t). in the first 24 patients (group 1), computation of qm and rsv from the color doppler recordings was compared with the conventional pulsed doppler method (r = .94, see=29.4 ml/s and r = .95, see=9.7 ml) as well as with angiography (r,=.93 and r,=.94, p < .001). the temporal variation of q(t) and a(t) was studied in the next 32 patients (group 2): in functional regurgitation in dilated cardiomyopathy (n= 12), there was a constant decrease in at) throughout systole with an increase during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 5.49±3.17. in mitral valve prolapse n=6), a(t) was small in early systole, increasing substantially in midsystole, and decreasing mildly during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 2.48±0.26. in rheumatic mitral regurgitation n= 14), a roughly constant regurgitant orifice area during most of systole was found in 4 patients. in the other patients there was significant variation of ast) and the time of its maximum; ap/am was 1.81 ±0.56. anova demonstrated that the differences in ap/am were related to the etiology of mitral regurgitation (p < .0001). to verify that the calculated variation in regurgitant orifice area during the cardiac cycle reflects an actual variation, the ability of the method to predict a constant orifice area throughout systole was tested experimentally in a canine model of mitral regurgitation. five flow stages were produced by implanting fixed grommet orifices of different sizes into the anterior mitral leaflet. a constant regurgitant orifice area was correctly predicted throughout systole with a mean percent error of −1.8±4% (from −6.9% to ±5.8%); the standard deviation of the individual curves calculated at 10% intervals during systole averaged 13.3% (from 3.6% to 19.6%). in addition, functional mitral regurgitation caused by ventricular dysfunction was produced pharmacologically in five dogs, and the color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region were obtained with the transducer placed directly on the heart instead of the chest, thus ruling out a significant effect of translational motion on the observed flow pattern. the pattern of regurgitant flow variation was identical to that observed in patients. conclusionsthe proximal flow convergence method demonstrates that regurgitant flow and orifice area vary throughout systole in distinct patterns characteristic of the underlying mechanism of mitral incompetence. therefore, in addition to the potential of the method as a tool to quantify mitral regurgitation, it allows analysis of the pathophysiology of regurgitation in the individual patient, which may be helpful in clinical decision making. calculating mitral regurgitant flow rate and volume from the time-varying proximal flow field (ie, without assuming a constant orifice area that would produce overestimation in individual patients) provides excellent agreement with independent techniques and agrees well with angiography.
hierarchical maximum margin learning for multi-class classification this chapter describes a new algorithm for training support vector machines: sequential minimal optimization, or smo. training a support vector machine (svm) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (qp) optimization problem. smo breaks this large qp problem into a series of smallest possible qp problems. these small qp problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical qp optimization as an inner loop. the amount of memory required for smo is linear in the training set size, which allows smo to handle very large training sets. because large matrix computation is avoided, smo scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (pcg) chunking algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. smo's computation time is dominated by svm evaluation, hence smo is fastest for linear svms and sparse data sets. for the mnist database, smo is as fast as pcg chunking; while for the uci adult database and linear svms, smo can be more than 1000 times faster than the pcg chunking algorithm.
a set of regulatory genes co-expressed in embryonic human brain is implicated in disrupted speech development purpose:the goal of this study was to identify new candidate genes and genomic copy-number variations associated with a rare, severe, and persistent speech disorder termed childhood apraxia of speech. childhood apraxia of speech is the speech disorder segregating with a mutation in foxp2 in a multigenerational london pedigree widely studied for its role in the development of speech–language in humans.methods:a total of 24 participants who were suspected to have childhood apraxia of speech were assessed using a comprehensive protocol that samples speech in challenging contexts. all participants met clinical-research criteria for childhood apraxia of speech. array comparative genomic hybridization analyses were completed using a customized 385k nimblegen array (roche nimblegen, madison, wi) with increased coverage of genes and regions previously associated with childhood apraxia of speech.results:a total of 16 copy-number variations with potential consequences for speech–language development were detected in 12 or half of the 24 participants. the copy-number variations occurred on 10 chromosomes, 3 of which had two to four candidate regions. several participants were identified with copy-number variations in two to three regions. in addition, one participant had a heterozygous foxp2 mutation and a copy-number variation on chromosome 2, and one participant had a 16p11.2 microdeletion and copy-number variations on chromosomes 13 and 14.conclusion:findings support the likelihood of heterogeneous genomic pathways associated with childhood apraxia of speech.genet med 2012:14(11):928–936

high-throughput analysis of synthetic peptides for the immunodiagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis identification of novel antigens is essential for developing new diagnostic tests and vaccines. we used dige to compare protein expression in amastigote and promastigote forms of leishmania chagasi. nine hundred amastigote and promastigote spots were visualized. five amastigote-specific, 25 promastigote-specific, and 10 proteins shared by the two parasite stages were identified. furthermore, 41 proteins were identified in the western blot employing 2-de and sera from infected dogs. from these proteins, 3 and 38 were reactive with igm and total igg, respectively. the proteins recognized by total igg presented different patterns in terms of their recognition by igg1 and/or igg2 isotypes. all the proteins selected by western blot were mapped for b-cell epitopes. one hundred and eighty peptides were submitted to spot synthesis and immunoassay. a total of 25 peptides were shown of interest for serodiagnosis to visceral leishmaniasis. in addition, all proteins identified in this study were mapped for t cell epitopes by using the netctl software, and candidates for vaccine development were selected. therefore, a large-scale screening of l. chagasi proteome was performed to identify new b and t cell epitopes with potential use for developing diagnostic tests and vaccines.
comparative geochemical and microbiological characterization of two thermal pools in the uzon caldera, kamchatka, russia archaea (archaebacteria) are a phenotypically diverse group of microorganisms that share a common evolutionary history. there are four general phenotypic groups of archaea: the methanogens, the extreme halophiles, the sulfate-reducing archaea, and the extreme thermophiles. in the marine environment, archaeal habitats are generally limited to shallow or deep-sea anaerobic sediments (free-living and endosymbiotic methanogens), hot springs or deep-sea hydrothermal vents (methanogens, sulfate reducers, and extreme thermophiles), and highly saline land-locked seas (halophiles). this report provides evidence for the widespread occurrence of unusual archaea in oxygenated coastal surface waters of north america. quantitative estimates indicated that up to 2% of the total ribosomal rna extracted from coastal bacterioplankton assemblages was archaeal. archaeal small-subunit ribosomal rna-encoding dnas (rdnas) were cloned from mixed bacterioplankton populations collected at geographically distant sampling sites. phylogenetic and nucleotide signature analyses of these cloned rdnas revealed the presence of two lineages of archaea, each sharing the diagnostic signatures and structural features previously established for the domain archaea. both of these lineages were found in bacterioplankton populations collected off the east and west coasts of north america. the abundance and distribution of these archaea in oxic coastal surface waters suggests that these microorganisms represent undescribed physiological types of archaea, which reside and compete with aerobic, mesophilic eubacteria in marine coastal environments.
identification of genes associated with primary open-angle glaucoma by bioinformatics approach purpose to identify the specific genes in human trabecular meshwork (tm) related to poag.   methods primary open-angle glaucoma tm specimens were obtained from routine trabeculectomy surgery. nonglaucomatous control tm specimens were dissected from donor eyes using the same approach as a standard trabeculectomy. all cases were screened for myocilin (myoc) mutations. total rna was extracted, labeled, and hybridized to illumina humanwg-6 beadchips. expression data were normalized and analyzed using the r package limma in bioconductor. pathway analyses were performed using david bioinformatics resources.   results our study included surgical tm specimens from 15 cases and 13 controls. one case was identified with a heterozygous q368x myoc mutation. if tms were available from both eyes in an individual, the expression data were combined for analysis. the following three comparisons were performed for differential analyses: (1) myoc poag case versus 14 non-myoc poag cases, (2) myoc poag case versus 13 controls, and (3) 14 non-myoc poag cases versus 13 controls. limited by one myoc case in comparisons 1 and 2, expression changes were reported comparing the fold changes but without p values. comparison 3 identified 483 genes, including 36 components of tm exosomes. gene ontology analysis identified several enriched functional clusters, including cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and secretion.   conclusions this is the largest tm expression study of poag cases and controls performed to date and represents the first report of tm expression in a patient having poag with a q368x myoc mutation. our data suggest the potential role of endocytic and exosome pathways in the pathogenesis of poag.
changes in corticostriatal connectivity during reinforcement learning in humans this experiment tested the idea that the amygdala-based learning and memory system covertly acquires a stimulus-reward (stimulus-outcome) association during acquisition of a stimulus-response (s-r) habit task developed for the eight-arm radial maze. groups of rats were given dorso-lateral striatal or amygdala lesions and then trained on the s-r habit task on the eight-arm radial maze. rats with neurotoxic damage to the dorso-lateral striatum were severely impaired on the acquisition of the s-r habit task but showed a conditioned-cue preference for the stimulus reinforced during s-r habit training. rats with neurotoxic damage to the amygdala were able to acquire the s-r habit task but did not show a conditioned-cue preference for the stimulus reinforced during s-r habit training. this pattern of results represents a dissociation of learning and memory functions of the dorsal striatum and amygdala on the same task.
prenatally diagnosed severe cdh: mortality and morbidity remain high. background/purpose congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh) remains a significant cause of neonatal death. a wide spectrum of disease severity and treatment strategies makes comparisons challenging. the objective of this study was to create a standardized reporting system for cdh.   methods data were prospectively collected on all live born infants with cdh from 51 centers in 9 countries. patients who underwent surgical correction had the diaphragmatic defect size graded (a-d) using a standardized system. other data known to affect outcome were combined to create a usable staging system. the primary outcome was death or hospital discharge.   results a total of 1,975 infants were evaluated. a total of 326 infants were not repaired, and all died. of the remaining 1,649, the defect was scored in 1,638 patients. a small defect (a) had a high survival, while a large defect was much worse. cardiac defects significantly worsened outcome. we grouped patients into 6 categories based on defect size with an isolated a defect as stage i. a major cardiac anomaly (+) placed the patient in the next higher stage. applying this, patient survival is 99% for stage i, 96% stage ii, 78% stage iii, 58% stage iv, 39% stage v, and 0% for non-repair.   conclusions the size of the diaphragmatic defect and a severe cardiac anomaly are strongly associated with outcome. standardizing reporting is imperative in determining optimal outcomes and effective therapies for cdh and could serve as a benchmark for prospective trials.
the effect of high-intensity aerobic interval training on markers of systemic inflammation in sedentary populations purposelong-term physical activity is reported to improve chronic systemic inflammation, which provides protection against the ensuing development of chronic disease. accordingly, the present study assessed changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, aerobic capacity and body composition following 8 weeks of either small-sided games (ssg) or cycling (cyc) training compared to a sedentary control (con) condition.methodsthirty-three middle-aged, sedentary men were randomized into cyc (n = 11), ssg (n = 11), or con (n = 11) conditions. the cyc and ssg conditions trained 3 days/week for 8 weeks, whilst con maintained habitual activity and dietary patterns. pre- and post-intervention testing included a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, sub-maximal (80 % maximal heart rate) aerobic capacity (vo2) and fasting venous blood. venous blood measures for pro-inflammatory markers included c-reactive protein (crp), interleukin (il)-6, il-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and leptin; anti-inflammatory markers included il-10, il-1 receptor agonist, and adiponectin.resultsboth cyc and ssg increased submaximal power output and vo2 (p < 0.05), decreased total body fat-mass (tb-fm; p < 0.05), and crp (ssg, −0.45 ± 0.42 mg l−1; p = 0.008; cyc, −0.44 ± 0.59 mg l−1; p = 0.02). only ssg increased total body fat-free mass (tb-ffm; +1.1 ± 1.2 kg; p = 0.001) and decreased concentration of plasma il-6 (−0.69 ± 0.62 pg ml−1; p = 0.002) and leptin (−2,212 ± 2,531 ng ml−1; p = 0.014).conclusioncycling and ssg training were both effective at improving crp, vo2 and tb-fm. furthermore, ssg training has also shown to be an effective training approach in reducing il-6 and leptin and increasing muscle mass within sedentary, middle-aged men.
early restriction of alphavirus replication and dissemination contributes to age-dependent attenuation of systemic hyperinflammatory disease. a comparative pathogenesis study was performed in neonatal mice using a molecularly cloned laboratory variant of sindbis strain ar339, designated trsb, and a single-site attenuated mutant of trsb derived by site-directed mutagenesis of the e2 glycoprotein from ser to arg at residue 114 (trsbr114). trsb caused 100% mortality with an average survival time of 3.0 +/- 0.7 days, whereas mice inoculated with trsbr114 exhibited an attenuated disease course with 46% mortality and an extended average survival time of 7.5 +/- 3.4 days for those animals that died. reduced virulence of trsbr114 was characterized by delayed appearance of detectable virus, relative to trsb, and by lower peak virus titers in both sera and brains of infected mice. trsb infection induced very high peak serum titers of interferon alpha/beta (215,000 units/ml compared to 2100 units/ml for trsbr114). in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated replication of trsb in brain, but only minimal histopathological changes and no evidence of encephalitis were observed. however, extensive extraneural lesions and viral replication were found in skin, connective tissue, and muscle. moreover, dramatic involution of the thymus and loss of hematopoietic tissues were observed in the absence of virus replication at these sites, suggesting the involvement of a systemic physiological stress response in trsb infection. trsbr114 infection did not cause thymic lesions. otherwise, the attenuated mutant demonstrated a similar pattern of tissue and organ involvement, but lesions and positive in situ hybridization signal were much more limited in scope and intensity compared to trsb. trsbr114-infected mice developed myositis and encephalomyelitis approximately 6 days postinfection. therefore, trsb-infected animals may succumb to an early syndrome associated with the stress response, preventing their survival for a time sufficient for the development of encephalitis. alternatively, a systemic stress response, as evidenced by thymic involution, may result in immunosuppression, thus contributing to the absence of encephalitis. in any event, the attenuating mutation in the e2 glycoprotein significantly altered the course of sindbis-induced disease by limiting virus replication and associated damage early in infection. mutant-infected animals survived beyond day 4 and progressed to a classical encephalomyelitis from which about half recovered.

iloc-virus: a multi-label learning classifier for identifying the subcellular localization of virus proteins with both single and multiple sites. conotoxins are disulfide rich small peptides that target a broad spectrum of ion-channels and neuronal receptors. they offer promising avenues in the treatment of chronic pain, epilepsy and cardiovascular diseases. assignment of newly sequenced mature conotoxins into appropriate superfamilies using a computational approach could provide valuable preliminary information on the biological and pharmacological functions of the toxins. however, creation of protein sequence patterns for the reliable identification and classification of new conotoxin sequences may not be effective due to the hypervariability of mature toxins. with the aim of formulating an in silico approach for the classification of conotoxins into superfamilies, we have incorporated the concept of pseudo-amino acid composition to represent a peptide in a mathematical framework that includes the sequence-order effect along with conventional amino acid composition. the polarity index attribute, which encodes information such as residue surface buriability, polarity, and hydropathy, was used to store the sequence-order effect. several methods like blast, isort (intimate sorting) predictor, least hamming distance algorithm, least euclidean distance algorithm and multi-class support vector machines (svms), were explored for superfamily identification. the svms outperform other methods providing an overall accuracy of 88.1% for all correct predictions with generalized squared correlation of 0.75 using jackknife cross-validation test for a, m, o and t superfamilies and a negative set consisting of short cysteine rich sequences from different eukaryotes having diverse functions. the computed sensitivity and specificity for the superfamilies were found to be in the range of 84.0-94.1% and 80.0-95.5%, respectively, attesting to the efficacy of multi-class svms for the successful in silico classification of the conotoxins into their superfamilies.
patterns of comorbidity in community-dwelling older people hospitalised for fall-related injury: a cluster analysis objectives to document the burden of in-hospital falls and fractures, and to identify factors that may increase the risk of these events. design a retrospective cohort analysis setting the study was set in the state of victoria, australia. participants hospital episode data collected in the victoria admitted episodes dataset, for all multiday-stay patients 18 years or more admitted to victorian public hospitals; 1 july 1998 to 30 june 2008. diagnoses were defined by the international classification of disease, 10th revision, australian modification (icd-10-am), which includes an in-hospital diagnostic timing code. outcome measures included rates of in-hospital falls and fractures, length of hospital stay and mortality. variables included in risk adjustment included financial year, individual demographic and comorbidity data, and hospital characteristics. results there were 3 345 415 episodes: 21 250 (0.64%) in-hospital falls and 4559 (0.14%) fractures. in-hospital fall (ihf) episode rates increased over the study period, but fracture episode rates were stable. mortality (hr 1.3, ci 1.3 to 1.5) and length of stay (median 19 days vs 5 days, p<0.0001) were increased with ihf. risk factors for ihf included dementia (rate ratio 1.7, ci 1.6 to 1.8) and delirium (rate ratio 1.8, ci 1.6 to 2.0). conclusions routinely collected data that include a hospital diagnostic timing code offer a standard method of quantifying in-hospital falls and fractures. unselected in-hospital falls data may be subject to reporting and documentation bias. the utility of using robust selected injuries such as ihf-related fracture as a quality-of-care indicator requires further investigation.
multi-level multi-task structured sparse learning for diagnosis of schizophrenia disease in multi-task learning (mtl), multiple related tasks are learned jointly by sharing information across them. many mtl algorithms have been proposed to learn the underlying task groups. however, those methods are limited to learn the task groups at only a single level, which may be not sufficient to model the complex structure among tasks in many real-world applications. in this paper, we propose a multi-level task grouping (metag) method to learn the multi-level grouping structure instead of only one level among tasks. specifically, by assuming the number of levels to be h, we decompose the parameter matrix into a sum of h component matrices, each of which is regularized with a l2 norm on the pairwise difference among parameters of all the tasks to construct level-specific task groups. for optimization, we employ the smoothing proximal gradient method to efficiently solve the objective function of the metag model. moreover, we provide theoretical analysis to show that under certain conditions the metag model can recover the true parameter matrix and the true task groups in each level with high probability. we experiment our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing competitive performance over state-of-the-art mtl methods.
first investigation of the microbiology of the deepest layer of ocean crust although the applicability of small subunit ribosomal rna (16s rrna) sequences for bacterial classification is now well accepted, the general use of these molecules has been hindered by the technical difficulty of obtaining their sequences. a protocol is described for rapidly generating large blocks of 16s rrna sequence data without isolation of the 16s rrna or cloning of its gene. the 16s rrna in bulk cellular rna preparations is selectively targeted for dideoxynucleotide-terminated sequencing by using reverse transcriptase and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to universally conserved 16s rrna sequences. three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to the three major 16s rrna structural domains, routinely yield 800-1000 nucleotides of 16s rrna sequence. the method is evaluated with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in the template rna, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of several 16s rrnas whose gene sequences are known. the relative simplicity of this approach should facilitate a rapid expansion of the 16s rrna sequence collection available for phylogenetic analyses.
cross-spectral analysis of tremor time series a variety of clinical and experimental findings suggest that parkinsonian resting tremor results from the involuntary activation of a central mechanism normally used for the production of rapid voluntary alternating movements. however, such central motor loop oscillations have never been directly demonstrated in parkinsonian patients. using magnetoencephalography, we recorded synchronized and tremor-related neuromagnetic activity over wide areas of the frontal and parietal cortex. the spatial and temporal organization of this activity was studied in seven patients suffering from early-stage idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd). single equivalent current dipole (ecd) analysis and fully three-dimensional distributed source solutions (magnetic field tomography, mft) were used in this analysis. ecd and mft solutions were superimposed on high-resolution mri. the findings indicate that 3 to 6 hz tremor in pd is accompanied by rhythmic subsequent electrical activation at the diencephalic level and in lateral premotor, somatomotor, and somatosensory cortex. tremor-evoked magnetic activity can be attributed to source generators that were previously described for voluntary movements. the interference of such slow central motor loop oscillations with voluntary motor activity may therefore constitute a pathophysiologic link between tremor and bradykinesia in pd. neurology 1996;46:1359-1370
neuroprotective effects of oral gallic acid against oxidative stress induced by 6-hydroxydopamine in rats. the present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape seed polyphenolic extract (gspe) previously found to attenuate cognitive deterioration in a mouse model of alzheimer's disease (ad). plasma pharmacokinetic response of major gspe phenolic components was measured following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg gspe per kg body weight. liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) analysis identified gallic acid (ga), catechin (c), and epicatechin (ec) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with gspe. additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-omega), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-omec), and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-omeec) were identified as circulating metabolites of gspe phenolic constituents. cmax for individual gspe constituents and their metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing gspe oral dose). repeated daily exposure to gspe was found to significantly increase bioavailability (defined as plasma auc0-8h) of ga, c, and ec by 198, 253, and 282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute gspe dose. ec and c were not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single gspe dose but reached levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats administered gspe for 10 days. this study suggests that brain deposition of ga, c, and ec is affected by repeated dosing of gspe.

a global map of science based on the isi subject categories author cocitation analysis (aca), a special type of cocitation analysis, was introduced by white and griffith in 1981. this technique is used to analyze the intellectual structure of a given scientific field. in 1990, mccain published a technical overview that has been largely adopted as a standard. here, mccain notes that pearson's correlation coefficient (pearson's r) is often used as a similarity measure in aca and presents some advantages of its use. the present article criticizes the use of pearson's r in aca and sets forth two natural requirements that a similarity measure applied in aca should satisfy. it is shown that pearson's r does not satisfy these requirements. real and hypothetical data are used in order to obtain counterexamples to both requirements. it is concluded that pearson's r is probably not an optimal choice of a similarity measure in aca. still, further empirical research is needed to show if, and in that case to what extent, the use of similarity measures in aca that fulfill these requirements would lead to objectively better results in full-scale studies. further, problems related to incomplete cocitation matrices are discussed.
dynamic causal modelling of lateral interactions in the visual cortex in this note, we describe a variant of dynamic causal modelling for evoked responses as measured with electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography (eeg and meg). we depart from equivalent current dipole formulations of dcm, and extend it to provide spatiotemporal source estimates that are spatially distributed. the spatial model is based upon neural-field equations that model neuronal activity on the cortical manifold. we approximate this description of electrocortical activity with a set of local standing-waves that are coupled though their temporal dynamics. the ensuing distributed dcm models source as a mixture of overlapping patches on the cortical mesh. time-varying activity in this mixture, caused by activity in other sources and exogenous inputs, is propagated through appropriate lead-field or gain-matrices to generate observed sensor data. this spatial model has three key advantages. first, it is more appropriate than equivalent current dipole models, when real source activity is distributed locally within a cortical area. second, the spatial degrees of freedom of the model can be specified and therefore optimised using model selection. finally, the model is linear in the spatial parameters, which finesses model inversion. here, we describe the distributed spatial model and present a comparative evaluation with conventional equivalent current dipole (ecd) models of auditory processing, as measured with eeg.
mutations in the sepiapterin reductase gene cause a novel tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent monoamine-neurotransmitter deficiency without hyperphenylalaninemia. a variant type of hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), the obligatory cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. the most frequent form of this cofactor deficiency is due to lack of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (ptps) activity, the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for bh4. the human liver cdna for ptps was previously isolated, and the recombinant protein was found to be active when expressed in escherichia coli. we now have investigated two patients for their molecular nature of this autosomal recessive disorder. both patients were diagnosed as ptps deficient, one with the central and one with the peripheral form, on the basis of an elevated serum phenylalanine concentration concomitant with lowered levels of urinary biopterin and ptps activity in erythrocytes. molecular analysis was performed on the patients' cultured primary skin fibroblasts. ptps activities were found in vitro to be reduced to background activity. direct cdna sequence analysis using reverse transcriptase-pcr technology showed for the patient with the central from a homozygous g-to-a transition at codon 25, causing the replacement of an arginine by glutamine (r25q). expression of this mutant allele in e. coli revealed 14% activity when compared with the wild-type enzyme. the patient with the peripheral form exhibited compound heterozygosity, having on one allele a c-to-t transition resulting in the substitution of arginine 16 for cysteine (r16c) in the enzyme and having on the second allele a 14-bp deletion (delta 14bp), leading to a frameshift at lysine 120 and a premature stop codon (k120-->stop). heterologous expression of the enzyme with the single-amino-acid exchange r16c revealed only 7% enzyme activity, whereas expression of the deletion allele delta 14bp exhibited no detectable activity. all three mutations, r25q, r16c, and k120-->stop, affect evolutionarily conserved residues in ptps, result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstituted in e. coli, and are thus believed to be the molecular cause for the bh4 deficiency. this is the first report describing mutations in ptps that lead to bh4 deficiency.
e4orf1: a novel ligand that improves glucose disposal in cell culture the proto-oncogene p21ras has been implicated as an essential intermediate in several actions of the hormone insulin. this study examines the role of p21ras in the signaling pathways by which insulin increases hexose transport in differentiated 3t3-l1 adipose cells, a model system for study of the metabolic effects of the hormone on a physiological target tissue. introduction of constitutively activated p21ras(g12v) by microinjection into 3t3-l1 adipocytes stimulated the expression of the ubiquitous glucose transporter, glut1, in the absence of insulin. moreover, introduction of dominant inhibitory forms of p21ras or neutralizing antibodies directed against p21ras blocked the insulin-induced increase in glut1 expression. in contrast, microinjection of activating or inhibitory forms of p21ras had no effect on translocation of the "insulin-responsive" glucose transporter, glut4, to the cell surface. these results indicate that p21ras mediates the insulin-induced increase in glut1 expression in 3t3-l1 adipocytes but is not involved in the translocation of glut4 that leads to acute increases in glucose transport.
multi-kernel low-rank dictionary pair learning for multiple features based image classification we investigate to what extent combinations of features can improve classification performance on a large dataset of similar classes. to this end we introduce a 103 class flower dataset. we compute four different features for the flowers, each describing different aspects, namely the local shape/texture, the shape of the boundary, the overall spatial distribution of petals, and the colour. we combine the features using a multiple kernel framework with a svm classifier. the weights for each class are learnt using the method of varma and ray, which has achieved state of the art performance on other large dataset, such as caltech 101/256. our dataset has a similar challenge in the number of classes, but with the added difficulty of large between class similarity and small within class similarity. results show that learning the optimum kernel combination of multiple features vastly improves the performance, from 55.1% for the best single feature to 72.8% for the combination of all features.
testing the interaction between analytical modules: an example with roundup ready® soybean line gts 40-3-2 the detection of genetically modified crops in foodstuff relies on detection of transgenic dna or protein material in the sample matrix. purified dna or proteins are used as analytical material for polymerase chain reaction technologies and immunodiagnostics. successful sample preparation is critical to the validity of subsequent analysis. for routine analysis, a good sample preparation technique should be simple, safe, and inexpensive while reproducibly generating dna/protein of sufficient quality and yield. the suitability of isolated dna or protein as an analyte for a detection or characterization technique depends on amount or concentration, purity, and integrity, each of which may be influenced by sample matrix and the extraction technique, and, in turn, may impact the validity of analytical techniques. the key sample preparation steps of homogenization, pretreatment, extraction, and purification are discussed as well as typical analytical methods. consideration is given to application of these steps for particular sample matrixes to maximize yield, reduce inhibition effects, and minimize contamination. the choice of the most appropriate and valid methods for sample preparation from particular foods is discussed with respect to dna analysis. attention is also given to ease of use, cost, and generic applicability of the procedures.
influence of magnetic field strength and image registration strategy on voxel‐based morphometry in a study of alzheimer's disease structural imaging based on magnetic resonance is an integral part of the clinical assessment of patients with suspected alzheimer dementia. prospective data on the natural history of change in structural markers from preclinical to overt stages of alzheimer disease are radically changing how the disease is conceptualized, and will influence its future diagnosis and treatment. atrophy of medial temporal structures is now considered to be a valid diagnostic marker at the mild cognitive impairment stage. structural imaging is also included in diagnostic criteria for the most prevalent non-alzheimer dementias, reflecting its value in differential diagnosis. in addition, rates of whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy are sensitive markers of neurodegeneration, and are increasingly used as outcome measures in trials of potentially disease-modifying therapies. large multicenter studies are currently investigating the value of other imaging and nonimaging markers as adjuncts to clinical assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of progression. the utility of structural imaging and other markers will be increased by standardization of acquisition and analysis methods, and by development of robust algorithms for automated assessment.
cloninger＇s psychobiological model of temperament and the discounting of delayed and effortful outcomes among adolescents objective to describe the psychometric properties of the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age children-present and lifetime version (k-sads-pl) interview, which surveys additional disorders not assessed in prior k-sads, contains improved probes and anchor points, includes diagnosis-specific impairment ratings, generates dsm-iii-r and dsm-iv diagnoses, and divides symptoms surveyed into a screening interview and five diagnostic supplements.   method subjects were 55 psychiatric outpatients and 11 normal controls (aged 7 through 17 years). both parents and children were used as informants. concurrent validity of the screen criteria and the k-sads-pl diagnoses was assessed against standard self-report scales. interrater (n = 15) and test-retest (n = 20) reliability data were also collected (mean retest interval: 18 days; range: 2 to 36 days).   results rating scale data support the concurrent validity of screens and k-sads-pl diagnoses. interrater agreement in scoring screens and diagnoses was high (range: 93% to 100%). test-retest reliability kappa coefficients were in the excellent range for present and/or lifetime diagnoses of major depression, any bipolar, generalized anxiety, conduct, and oppositional defiant disorder (.77 to 1.00) and in the good range for present diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (.63 to .67).   conclusion results suggest the k-sads-pl generates reliable and valid child psychiatric diagnoses.
restoration of menses with nonpharmacologic therapy in college athletes with menstrual disturbances: a 5-year retrospective study. total daily energy expenditure (tee) by the doubly-labelled (2h218o) water method and basal metabolic rate (bmr) by indirect calorimetry were measured in thirty-two healty free-living adults in northern ireland. habitual physical activity patterns in occupational and discretionary activities were assessed by interview questionnaire. expressed as a multiple of bmr the tee values for the sixteen males (1.88 (sd 0.28), range 1.44-2.57) and sixteen females (1.77 (sd 0.16), range 1.50-2.06) were compatible with current department of health and social security (dhss; 1979) and food and agriculture organization/world health organization/united nations university (fao/who/unu; 1985) estimates of energy requirements. the results suggest that discretionary physical activity is now emerging as an equally important determinant of energy expenditure in the uk as the occupational classifications currently used as the basis of dhss (1979) and fao/who/unu (1985) recommendations for energy requirements. therefore, realistically achievable inputs of recreational exercise can have a significant impact in counteracting low levels of energy expenditure which are associated with modern lifestyles and are implicated as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and obesity.
individual comparisons of the levels of (e)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, an axillary odor-related compound, in japanese. the axillary microflora of 229 subjects was characterized quantitatively and the results correlated with whether the odor was pungent body odor or instead a faint "acid odor". the axillary flora was found to be a stable mixture of micrococcaceae, aerobic diphtheroids and propionibacteria. significantly higher numbers of bacteria were recovered from the axilla of those with pungent axillary odor than in those with acid odor. aerobic diphtheroids in high numbers were recovered in all subjects having typical body odor. these included lipophilic as well as large-colony diphtheroids. when droplets of apocrine sweat placed on the forearm were inoculated with various bacteria which reside in the axilla, only diphtheroids generated typical body odor. cocci produced a sweaty odor attributable to isovaleric acid.
signaling in chemotactic amoebae remains spatially confined to stimulated membrane regions motile eukaryotic cells migrate with directional persistence by alternating left and right turns, even in the absence of external cues. for example, dictyostelium discoideum cells crawl by extending distinct pseudopods in an alternating right-left pattern. the mechanisms underlying this zig-zag behavior, however, remain unknown. here we propose a new excitable cortex and memory (ec&m) model for understanding the alternating, zig-zag extension of pseudopods. incorporating elements of previous models, we consider the cell cortex as an excitable system and include global inhibition of new pseudopods while a pseudopod is active. with the novel hypothesis that pseudopod activity makes the local cortex temporarily more excitable – thus creating a memory of previous pseudopod locations – the model reproduces experimentally observed zig-zag behavior. furthermore, the ec&m model makes four new predictions concerning pseudopod dynamics. to test these predictions we develop an algorithm that detects pseudopods via hierarchical clustering of individual membrane extensions. data from cell-tracking experiments agrees with all four predictions of the model, revealing that pseudopod placement is a non-markovian process affected by the dynamics of previous pseudopods. the model is also compatible with known limits of chemotactic sensitivity. in addition to providing a predictive approach to studying eukaryotic cell motion, the ec&m model provides a general framework for future models, and suggests directions for new research regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying directional persistence.
analysis of candidate genes for macular telangiectasia type 2 introduction the aim of this review was to describe the use of optical coherence tomography (oct) in the diagnosis and management of retinal angiomatous proliferation (rap) in patients with age-related macular degeneration (amd).   materials and methods we reviewed the tomographic characteristics of the eyes affected by rap seen at our institution and imaged by oct. some eyes with rap were also studied with oct prior to and after laser treatment to determine the tomographic changes following laser photocoagulation.   results in this preliminary report, oct showed a typical pattern of structural changes in rap: increased foveal thickness, cystoid macular oedema (cme) consisting of large central cysts and smaller cystoid spaces located mainly in the outer retinal layers, serous retinal detachment and a highly reflective intraretinal mass overlying a highly or moderately elevated retinal pigment epithelium (rpe). this mass corresponded to the hot spot observed on icg angiography. after successful laser photocoagulation, significant decrease in foveal thickness, complete resolution of cme and retinal detachment with thinning of the neurosensory retina overlying the treated area could be observed.   conclusions oct appears to be useful in evaluating and documenting rap in amd patients both before and after laser photocoagulation. longitudinal studies are required to determine its exact place and utility in clinical practice.
constraint-induced movement therapy during early stroke rehabilitation preliminary assessments of the feasibility, safety, and effects on neuronal reorganization measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) from constraint-induced movement therapy (cimt) of the upper extremity were made in eight cases of subacute stroke. within fourteen days of their stroke, patients were randomly assigned to two weeks of cimt or traditional therapy. baseline motor performance and cortical/subcortical representation for movement with tms were assessed before treatment. post-treatment assessments were made at the end of treatment and at three months after the stroke. the tms mapping showed a larger motor representation in the lesioned hemisphere of the cimt patients as compared to the controls at the three-month follow-up assessment. the enlarged motor representation in the lesioned hemisphere for hand movement correlated with improved motor function of the affected hand, suggesting a link between movement representation size as measured with tms and functionality. these results suggest that tms can be safely and effectively used to assess brain function in subacute stroke and further suggest that cimt may enhance cortical/subcortical motor reorganization and accelerate motor recovery when started within the first two weeks after stroke. this research was supported by a us phs grant to harvey levin. we thank magda jungman, eva salmeron, jenny lai, and thao tran for assisting with patient enrollment, therapy, and assessment testing, courtney russell, gurpreet sarao, and vibha tare for coordinating the project, christine joy and elizabeth pienkos for assistance with collecting the tms data, david lane for statistical advice, and the patients for their patience and willingness to participate in this study. scott burgin is now at the university of rochester.
elective open suprarenal aneurysm repair in england from 2000 to 2010 an observational study of hospital episode statistics background studies using english administrative data from the hospital episode statistics (hes) are increasingly used for the assessment of health-care quality. this study aims to catalogue the published body of studies using hes data to assess health-care outcomes, to assess their methodological qualities and to determine if reporting recommendations can be formulated.   methods systematic searches of the embase, medline and cochrane databases were performed using defined search terms. included studies were those that described the use of hes data extracts to assess health-care outcomes.   results a total of 148 studies were included. the majority of published studies were on surgical specialties (60.8%), and the most common analytic theme was of inequalities and variations in treatment or outcome (27%). the volume of published studies has increased with time (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001), as has the length of study period (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) and the number of outcomes assessed per study (r = 0.72, p = 0.0023). age (80%) and gender (57.4%) were the most commonly used factors in risk adjustment, and regression modelling was used most commonly (65.2%) to adjust for confounders. generic methodologic data were better reported than those specific to hes data extraction. for the majority of parameters, there were no improvements with time.   conclusions studies published using hes data to report health-care outcomes have increased in volume, scope and complexity with time. however, persisting deficiencies related to both generic and context-specific reporting have been identified. recommendations have been made to improve these aspects as it is likely that the role of these studies in assessing health care, benchmarking practice and planning service delivery will continue to increase.
testing the equal environments assumption in the children of twins design context although there is now considerable evidence that genetic effects play a critical role in the development of alcohol dependence (ad), theoretical and methodological limitations of this literature require caution in describing the etiology and development of this disorder.   objective to disentangle genetic and environmental effects on ad by means of the infrequently used, yet potentially powerful, offspring-of-twins design.   design offspring of twins.   participants male monozygotic and dizygotic twins concordant or discordant for ad and control pairs from the vietnam era twin registry were assessed, as were the offspring of these twins and the mothers of these offspring.   interventions structured psychiatric interviews.   main outcome measures participants' psychiatric, alcohol abuse (aa), and ad histories (dsm-iv).   results offspring of monozygotic and dizygotic twins with a history of ad were significantly more likely to exhibit aa or ad than were offspring of nonalcoholic fathers. offspring of an alcohol-abusing monozygotic twin whose co-twin was ad were also more likely to exhibit ad than were offspring of nonalcoholic twins. in contrast, offspring of an unaffected (ie, no history of abuse or dependence) monozygotic twin whose co-twin was ad were no more likely to exhibit aa or ad than were offspring of nonalcoholic twins.   conclusions these findings support the hypothesis that family environmental effects do make a difference in accounting for offspring outcomes, in particular, that a low-risk environment (ie, the absence of parental alcoholism) can moderate the impact of high genetic risk regarding offspring for the development of alcohol-use disorders.
hierarchical disentangled representations categorical variables are a natural choice for representing discrete structure in the world. however, stochastic neural networks rarely use categorical latent variables due to the inability to backpropagate through samples. in this work, we present an efficient gradient estimator that replaces the non-differentiable sample from a categorical distribution with a differentiable sample from a novel gumbel-softmax distribution. this distribution has the essential property that it can be smoothly annealed into a categorical distribution. we show that our gumbel-softmax estimator outperforms state-of-the-art gradient estimators on structured output prediction and unsupervised generative modeling tasks with categorical latent variables, and enables large speedups on semi-supervised classification.
better preservation of endocrine function after central versus distal pancreatectomy for mid-gland lesions. background limited middle segment pancreatectomy, or central pancreatectomy, has been described for sparing normal pancreatic tissue during resection of benign neoplasms of the pancreatic neck. anatomic reconstruction after central pancreatectomy has been reported in other series with creation of a roux-en-y loop of jejunum for a mucosa-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy.   study design hospital charts and outpatient records were reviewed for 12 consecutive patients undergoing central pancreatectomy from august 1999 to november 2002.   results we performed central pancreatectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy in 12 patients: 5 with serous cystadenomas, 6 with mucinous cystadenomas, and 1 with neuroendocrine tumor. all tumors were located in the body or neck of the pancreas, measuring a mean +/- standard deviation (sd) of 2.5 +/- 1.2 cm. median postoperative hospital stay was 6.5 days (range 5 to 15 days). there were no intraoperative complications. perioperative complications included two urinary tract infections and one readmission for acute pancreatitis. there were no pancreatic leaks or fistulas in this series. two of the 12 patients experienced endocrine insufficiency with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin levels during outpatient followup. none of the 12 patients experienced exocrine insufficiency.   conclusions central pancreatectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy reconstruction is safe and technically advantageous over roux-en-y pancreaticojejunostomy, and should be considered a safe reconstruction technique after central pancreatectomy for benign disease.
language evolution in the lab tends toward informative communication why do languages have the semantic categories they do? each language partitions human experience into a system of semantic categories, labeled by words or morphemes, which are used to communicate about experience. these categories often differ widely across languages. thus, languages do not merely provide different labels for the same universally shared set of categories—instead, both the labels and the categories themselves may be to some extent language-specific. however this cross-language variation is constrained. words with similar or identical meanings often appear in unrelated languages, and most logically possible meanings are unattested—suggesting that there are universal forces constraining the cross-language diversity. accounting for this pattern of wide but constrained variation is a central theoretical challenge in understanding why languages have the particular forms they do.
a putative multicopper protein secreted by an atypical type ii secretion system involved in the reduction of insoluble electron acceptors in geobacter sulfurreducens. abstract members of the genus geobacter are the dominant metal-reducing microorganisms in a variety of anaerobic subsurface environments and have been shown to be involved in the bioremediation of both organic and metal contaminants. to facilitate the study of the physiology of these organisms, a genetic system was developed forgeobacter sulfurreducens. the antibiotic sensitivity of this organism was characterized, and optimal conditions for plating it at high efficiency were established. a protocol for the introduction of foreign dna into g. sulfurreducens by electroporation was also developed. two classes of broad-host-range vectors, incq and pbbr1, were found to be capable of replication in g. sulfurreducens. in particular, the incq plasmid pcd342 was found to be a suitable expression vector for this organism. when the information and novel methods described above were utilized, thenifd gene of g. sulfurreducens was disrupted by the single-step gene replacement method. insertional mutagenesis of this key gene in the nitrogen fixation pathway impaired the ability of g. sulfurreducens to grow in medium lacking a source of fixed nitrogen. expression of thenifd gene in trans complemented this phenotype. this paper constitutes the first report of genetic manipulation of a member of the geobacter genus.
laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas: a randomized trial on different surgical techniques. part i: clinical results. the management of large endometriomas was described in a series of 814 patients. combined therapy using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (gnrha) and carbon dioxide laser laparoscopy was proposed. drainage and gnrha for 12 weeks provoked a reduction of the endometrioma size up to 50% of the initial value. after vaporization of the internal wall, a cumulative pregnancy of 51% after 1 year was achieved. a recurrence rate of 8% was observed for a follow-up of 2-11 years. histological data demonstrated that the epithelium covering the ovary which is the mesothelium can invaginate in the ovarian cortex. some of the invaginations were seen to be continuous with endometrial tissue, strongly suggesting the metaplasia theory in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma.
altered lignin biosynthesis improves cellulosic bioethanol production in transgenic maize plants down-regulated for cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. the maize (zea mays l.) caffeic acid o-methyl-transferase (comt) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of lignin. in this work we have characterized the involvement of comt in the lignification process through the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in its regulation. the examination of the maize comt gene promoter revealed a putative aciii box, typically recognized by r2r3-myb transcription factors. we used the sequence of known r2r3-myb factors to isolate five maize r2r3-myb factors (zmmyb2, zmmyb8, zmmyb31, zmmyb39, and zmmyb42) and study their possible roles as regulators of the maize comt gene. the factors zmmyb8, zmmy31, and zmmyb42 belong to the subgroup 4 of the r2r3-myb family along with other factors associated with lignin biosynthesis repression. in addition, the induction pattern of zmmyb31 and zmmyb42 gene expression on wounding is that expected for repressors of the maize comt gene. arabidopsisthaliana plants over-expressing zmmyb31 and zmmyb42 down-regulate both the a. thaliana and the maize comt genes. furthermore, the over-expression of zmmyb31 and zmmyb42 also affect the expression of other genes of the lignin pathway and produces a decrease in lignin content of the transgenic plants.
public health terminology: hindrance to a health in all policies approach? action on the social determinants of health (sdh) through intersectoral policymaking is often suggested to promote health and health equity. this paper argues that the process of intersectoral policymaking influences how the sdh are construed and acted upon in municipal policymaking. we discuss how the intersectoral policy process legitimates certain practices in the setting of danish municipal health promotion and the potential impact this can have for long-term, sustainable healthy public policy. based on ethnographic fieldwork, we show how the intention of intersectoriality produces a strong concern for integrating health into non-health sectors to ensure productive collaboration. to encourage this integration, health is often framed as a means to achieve the objectives of non-health sectors. in doing so, the intersectoral policy process tends to favor smaller-scale interventions that aim to introduce healthier practices into various settings, e.g. creating healthy school environments for increased physical activity and healthy eating. while other more overarching interventions on the health impacts of broader welfare policies (e.g. education policy) tend to be neglected. the interventions hereby neglect to address more fundamental sdh. based on these findings, we argue that intersectoral policymaking to address the sdh may translate into a limited approach to action on so-called 'intermediary determinants' of health, and as such may end up corrupting the broader sdh. further, we discuss how this corruption affects the intended role of non-health sectors in tackling the sdh, as it may impede the overall success and long-term sustainability of intersectoral efforts.
determining the time period and amount of training data for stock exchange of thailand index prediction this paper proposes the prediction method for stock exchange of thailand index (set index). the proposed method was adapted from [1] by adding more important factors to the prediction function. this research takes into account both external and internal factors to forecast the set index. the external factors are the historical movement of the world's major stock exchange market indices such as dow jones, nikkei and hang seng index, while the internal factors are the historical movement of the set index and minimum loan rate (mlr). the experimental result on both short and long term data show that the proposed method has lower errors for both mean squared error (mse) and mean absolute percentage error (mape) measures. in addition, the proposed function can be put into the spreadsheet which makes it easier and faster for the investors to analyze the trend of stock exchange market.
adrenomedullin in experimental congestive heart failure: cardiorenal activation. background adrenomedullin (adm) is a newly discovered vasodilating and natriuretic peptide that may play an important role in cardiorenal regulation. although adm was originally isolated from human pheochromocytoma, adm-like immunoreactivity has also been widely detected in various tissues, including the cardiovascular system.   methods and results in view of reports that adm circulates in the body and that adm gene and adm-like immunoreactivity are present in the heart, the present study was designed to determine the plasma concentration of adm in healthy subjects and in patients with congestive heart failure (chf) and to investigate the immunohistochemical presence and localization of adm in normal and failing human hearts. plasma adm concentration was 13.2 +/- 2.3 pg/ml in healthy subjects (n = 11) and increased to 47.3 +/- 6.7 pg/ml in patients with chf (n = 11 p < .05 versus normal). human cardiac tissues were obtained from five patients with end-stage chf undergoing cardiac transplantation. five normal donor hearts that were used for cardiac transplantation served as sources for normal atrial tissues. normal ventricular myocardium was also obtained by endomyocardial biopsy from the right ventricles of these donor hearts immediately before cardiac transplantation. positive immunostaining was detected within the myocardia in both atria and ventricles of healthy and severely failing human transplanted hearts and was more intense in the atria than in the ventricles. although there were no significant differences in the intensity of immunoreactivity between normal and failing atria, adm immunoreactivity was significantly more intense in the ventricular myocytes from failing hearts compared with normal hearts.   conclusions the present study demonstrates that plasma concentration of adm is increased in patients with chf and that adm is present in the human heart. adm immunoreactivity is markedly increased in the failing human ventricle, suggesting that ventricular adm expression may be influenced by the circumstances associated with chf. this supports a potential role for this newly identified vasoactive and natriuretic peptide, adm, in the neurohumoral activation that characterizes human chf.
population differences in brain morphology and microstructure among chinese, malay, and indian neonates mri is a sensitive method for detecting subtle anatomic abnormalities in the neonatal brain. to optimize the usefulness for neonatal and pediatric care, systematic research, based on quantitative image analysis and functional correlation, is required. normalization-based image analysis is one of the most effective methods for image quantification and statistical comparison. however, the application of this methodology to neonatal brain mri scans is rare. some of the difficulties are the rapid changes in t1 and t2 contrasts and the lack of contrast between brain structures, which prohibits accurate cross-subject image registration. diffusion tensor imaging (dti), which provides rich and quantitative anatomical contrast in neonate brains, is an ideal technology for normalization-based neonatal brain analysis. in this paper, we report the development of neonatal brain atlases with detailed anatomic information derived from dti and co-registered anatomical mri. combined with a diffeomorphic transformation, we were able to normalize neonatal brain images to the atlas space and three-dimensionally parcellate images into 122 regions. the accuracy of the normalization was comparable to the reliability of human raters. this method was then applied to babies of 37-53 post-conceptional weeks to characterize developmental changes of the white matter, which indicated a posterior-to-anterior and a central-to-peripheral direction of maturation. we expect that future applications of this atlas will include investigations of the effect of prenatal events and the effects of preterm birth or low birth weights, as well as clinical applications, such as determining imaging biomarkers for various neurological disorders.
electrostatics of aquaporin and aquaglyceroporin channels correlates with their transport selectivity transmembrane channel proteins play pivotal roles in maintaining the homeostasis and responsiveness of cells and the cross-membrane electrochemical gradient by mediating the transport of ions and molecules through biological membranes. therefore, computational methods which, given a set of 3d coordinates, can automatically identify and describe channels in transmembrane proteins are key tools to provide insights into how they function. herein we present porewalker, a fully automated method, which detects and fully characterises channels in transmembrane proteins from their 3d structures. a stepwise procedure is followed in which the pore centre and pore axis are first identified and optimised using geometric criteria, and then the biggest and longest cavity through the channel is detected. finally, pore features, including diameter profiles, pore-lining residues, size, shape and regularity of the pore are calculated, providing a quantitative and visual characterization of the channel. to illustrate the use of this tool, the method was applied to several structures of transmembrane channel proteins and was able to identify shape/size/residue features representative of specific channel families. the software is available as a web-based resource at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/porewalker/.
number of days required to estimate habitual activity using wrist-worn geneactiv accelerometer: a cross-sectional study purpose to examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (n = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.   methods physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the computer science applications (csa) accelerometer. day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated.   results physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. for activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring.   conclusion these findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
reducing the duration of paired-comparison experiments for visual quality assessment this paper describes a more efficient paired comparison method that reduces the number of trials necessary for converting a table of paired comparisons into scaler data. instead of comparing every pair of samples (the complete method), a partial method is used that makes more comparisons between closer samples than between more distant samples. a sorting algorithm is used to effi- ciently order the samples with paired comparisons, and each com- parison is recorded. when the sorting is completed, more trials will have been conducted between closer samples than between distant samples. regression is used to scale the resulting comparison ma- trix into a one dimensional perceptual quality estimate. © 2001 spie
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
proanthocyanidins and the risk of prostate cancer in italy the validity of a 77-item food-frequency questionnaire (ffq) developed for a multicenter case-control study on diet and cancer in italy was assessed. trained interviewers administered the same ffq to 452 volunteers from three italian provinces (pordenone, genoa, and forli) completed in two different seasons, at an interval of 3 to 10 months. for 395 (130 males, 265 females; median age = 52 years; range = 35 to 69 years) volunteers, two 7-day dietary (7-dd) records were available. average intake obtained by means of the ffq was overestimated by approximately 18% in comparison with the corresponding values based on the two 7-dd records (reference method). pearson partial correlation coefficients, adjusted for total energy intake between the nutrient intakes assessed by the ffq and reference method, ranged from 0.19 for vegetable fat to 0.64 for sugar (median value r = 0.46). the unadjusted deattenuated coefficients, which took into account the interindividual variability of consumption, estimated by means of the two 7-dd records, ranged from 0.29 for vegetable fat to 0.72 for starch (median value r = 0.54). the proportion of subjects correctly classified within the lowest two quintiles ranged between 59% for vegetable fat and vitamin e, and 96% for alcohol, and those correctly classified within the highest two quintiles ranged between 44% for vegetable fat and 94% for alcohol. the average proportion of subjects correctly classified within one quintile was 73%. these data indicate that this ffq provides valid estimates of intakes for major nutrients, comparable to those reported from other studies in north america and other european countries.
bounded search for de novo identification of degenerate cis-regulatory elements the identification of potential protein binding sites (cis-regulatory elements) in the upstream regions of genes is key to understanding the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. to this end, we present a simple, efficient algorithm, beam (beam-search enumerative algorithm for motif finding), aimed at the discovery of cis-regulatory elements in the dna sequences upstream of a related group of genes. this algorithm dramatically limits the search space of expanded sequences, converting the problem from one that is exponential in the length of motifs sought to one that is linear. unlike sampling algorithms, our algorithm converges and is capable of finding statistically overrepresented motifs with a low failure rate. further, our algorithm is not dependent on the objective function or the organism used. limiting the space of candidate motifs enables the algorithm to focus only on those motifs that are most likely to be biologically relevant and enables the algorithm to use direct evaluations of background frequencies instead of resorting to probabilistic estimates. in addition, limiting the space of candidate motifs makes it possible to use computationally expensive objective functions that are able to correctly identify biologically relevant motifs.
comparison of the xylose reductase-xylitol dehydrogenase and the xylose isomerase pathways for xylose fermentation by recombinant saccharomyces cerevisiae evidence is presented that xylose metabolism in the anaerobic cellulolytic fungus piromyces sp. e2 proceeds via a xylose isomerase rather than via the xylose reductase/xylitol-dehydrogenase pathway found in xylose-metabolising yeasts. the xyla gene encoding the piromyces xylose isomerase was functionally expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae. heterologous isomerase activities in cell extracts, assayed at 30 degrees c, were 0.3-1.1 micromol min(-1) (mg protein)(-1), with a km for xylose of 20 mm. the engineered s. cerevisiae strain grew very slowly on xylose. it co-consumed xylose in aerobic and anaerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures at rates of 0.33 and 0.73 mmol (g biomass)(-1) h(-1), respectively.
sarcoptic mange vulnerability in carnivores of the białowieża primeval forest, poland: underlying determinant factors we would like to report the identification of sarcoptic mange in badgers ( meles meles ) from south-west england.  an adolescent female badger was received for postmortem examination, following the deaths of four other badgers in the same locality over a two-week period. all the affected badgers
predicting the spatial distribution of an invasive plant species (eupatorium adenophorum) in china a representation and interpretation of the area under a receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve obtained by the "rating" method, or by mathematical predictions based on patient characteristics, is presented. it is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric wilcoxon statistic. these two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed roc curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.
small-molecule inhibitors of biofilm formation in laboratory and clinical isolates of candida albicans. the pathogenic yeast candida albicans can grow in multiple morphological states including budded, pseudohyphal and true hyphal forms. the ability to interconvert between budded and hyphal forms, herein termed the budded-to-hyphal transition (bht), is important for c. albicans virulence, and is regulated by multiple environmental and cellular signals. to identify small-molecule inhibitors of known cellular processes that can also block the bht, a microplate-based morphological assay was used to screen the biomol-institute of chemistry and cell biology (iccb) known bioactives collection from the iccb-longwood screening facility (harvard medical school, boston, ma, usa). of 480 molecules tested, 53 were cytotoxic to c. albicans and 16 were able to block the bht without inhibiting budded growth. these 16 bht inhibitors affected protein kinases, protein phosphatases, ras signalling pathways, g protein-coupled receptors, calcium homeostasis, nitric oxide and guanylate cyclase signalling, and apoptosis in mammalian cells. several of these molecules were also able to inhibit filamentous growth in other candida species, as well as the pathogenic filamentous fungus aspergillus fumigatus, suggesting a broad fungal host range for these inhibitory molecules. results from secondary assays, including hyphal-specific transcription and septin localization analysis, were consistent with the inhibitors affecting known bht signalling pathways in c. albicans. therefore, these molecules will not only be invaluable in deciphering the signalling pathways regulating the bht, but also may serve as starting points for potential new antifungal therapeutics.
polling with physical envelopes: a rigorous analysis of a human-centric protocol a survey technique for improving the reliability of responses to sensitive interview questions is described. the technique permits the respondentto answer "yes" or "no" to a question without the interviewer knowing what informationis being conveyed by the respondent. the privacy of the interviewee is protected by randomizing his response. for example if all members of a population belong either to group a or to group b and the investigator wants to determine the proportion of group a individuals in the population, this information can be elicited by using the following procedures. before each interview, the respondent is provided with a spinner marked with a point a and a point b. the spinner is marked off in such a way that the spinner's marker will stop at point a with a probability of p and at point b with a probability of 1-p. when the interviewer asks the sensitive question concerning group membership, the respondent spins the spinner out of the sight of the interviewer. the marker will either stop at point a or point b. the respondent then indicates whether or not he belongs to the group to which the marker is pointing. the respondent does not tell the interviewer where the marker is pointing. assuming that these responses are truthful, it is then possible to determine maximum likelihood estimates of the true proportion of as in the population. the formula for calculating these estimates is provided. both the degree of truthfulness which can be expected from the respondents and the sample size required for given levels of precision depends on the parameter p.
β-zone parapapillary atrophy and the rate of retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in glaucoma. purpose beta-zone parapapillary atrophy (ppa) occurs more commonly in eyes with glaucoma. rates of glaucomatous visual field (vf) progression in eyes with and without beta-zone ppa at the time of baseline assessment were compared.   design retrospective, comparative study.   participants two hundred forty-five patients from the new york glaucoma progression study.   methods subjects with glaucomatous optic neuropathy and repeatable vf loss were assessed for eligibility. eyes with a heidelberg retina tomograph ii (hrt) examination, at least 5 visual field tests after the hrt in either eye, optic disc photographs, and <6 diopters of myopia were enrolled. beta-zone ppa was defined as a region of chorioretinal atrophy with visible sclera and choroidal vessels adjacent to the optic disc. global rates of vf progression were determined by automated pointwise linear regression analysis. univariate analysis included age, gender, ethnicity, central corneal thickness (cct), refractive error, baseline mean deviation, baseline intraocular pressure (iop), mean iop, iop fluctuation, disc area, rim area, rim area-to-disc area ratio, beta-zone ppa area, beta-zone ppa area-to-disc area ratio, and presence or absence of beta-zone ppa.   main outcome measures the relationship between beta-zone ppa and the rate and risk of glaucoma progression.   results two hundred forty-five eyes of 245 patients (mean age, 69.6+/-12.3 years) were enrolled. the mean follow-up was 4.9+/-1.4 years and the mean number of vfs after hrt was 9.3+/-2.7. beta-zone ppa was present in 146 eyes (65%). eyes with beta-zone ppa progressed more rapidly (-0.84+/-0.8 db/year) than eyes without it (-0.51+/-0.6 db/year; p<0.01). multivariate regression showed significant influence of mean iop (hazard ratio [hr], 1.11; p<0.01), iop fluctuation (hr, 1.17; p = 0.02), and presence of beta-zone ppa (hr, 2.59; p<0.01) on vf progression. moderate (0.5-1.5 db/year; p = 0.01) and fast (>1.5 db/year; p = 0.08) global rates of progression occurred more commonly in eyes with beta-zone ppa than in eyes without it. thinner cct (<525 microm) had a weak but significant correlation with presence of beta-zone ppa (kappa = 0.13).   conclusions eyes with beta-zone ppa are at increased risk for glaucoma progression and warrant close clinical surveillance.
mice null for calsequestrin 1 exhibit deficits in functional performance and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling to monitor cytosolic [ca2+] over a wide range of concentrations in functioning skeletal muscle cells, we have used simultaneously the rapid but relatively low affinity calcium indicator antipyrylazo iii (ap iii) and the slower but higher affinity indicator fura-2 in single frog twitch fibers cut at both ends and voltage clamped with a double vaseline gap system. when both dyes were added to the end pool solution the cytosolic fura-2 concentration reached a steady level equal to the end pool concentration within approximately 2.5 h, a time when the ap iii concentration was still increasing. for depolarizing pulses of increasing amplitude, the fura-2 fluorescence signal approached saturation when the simultaneously recorded ap iii absorbance change was far from saturation. comparison of simultaneously recorded fura-2 and ap iii signals indicated that the mean values of the on and off rate constants for calcium binding to fura-2 in 18 muscle fibers were 1.49 x 10(8) m-1 s-1 and 11.9 s-1, respectively (mean kd = 89 nm), if all ap iii in the fiber is assumed to behave as in calibrating solution and to be in instantaneous equilibrium with [ca2+]. [ca2+] transients calculated from the fura-2 signals using these rate constants were consistent with the [ca2+] transients calculated from the ap iii signals. resting [ca2+] or small changes in [ca2+] which could not be reliably monitored with ap iii could be monitored with fura-2 with little or no interference from changes in [mg2+] or from intrinsic signals. the fura-2 signal was also less sensitive to movement artifacts than the ap iii signal. after a [ca2+] transient the fura-2 signal demonstrated a relatively small elevation of [ca2+] that was maintained for many seconds.
the effects of visual realism on search tasks in mixed reality simulation we propose the use of virtual environments to simulate augmented reality (ar) systems for the purposes of experimentation and usability evaluation. this method allows complete control in the ar environment, providing many advantages over testing with true ar systems. we also discuss some of the limitations to the simulation approach. we have demonstrated the use of such a simulation in a proof of concept experiment controlling the levels of registration error in the ar scenario. in this experiment, we used the simulation method to investigate the effects of registration error on task performance for a generic task involving precise motor control for ar object manipulation. isolating jitter and latency errors, we provide empirical evidence of the relationship between accurate registration and task performance.
depressive symptoms are associated with analgesic use in people with alzheimer’s disease: kuopio alsova study background we studied the suitability of the consortium to establish a registry for alzheimer's disease neuropsychological battery (cerad-nb) total score for monitoring alzheimer's disease (ad) progression in early-diagnosed medicated patients. we also investigated possible differences in progression between patients with very mild or mild baseline ad.   methods in this three-year follow-up of 115 alsova study patients with clinical dementia ratings (cdr) of very mild (0.5) or mild (1) ad, we analyzed total cerad-nb, mini-mental state examination (mmse), neuropsychiatric inventory (npi), the alzheimer's disease cooperative study-activities of daily living inventory, and clinical dementia rating sum of boxes scores. correlations were identified with efficacy parameters.   results over three years, total cerad-nb declined significantly in both groups. annual change rates of total cerad-nb were also significant. total cerad-nb revealed annual differences in cognition between study groups, while mmse did not. total cerad-nb correlated well with other cognitive and global measures, but not with npi. for almost two years, the cdr-0.5 group maintained a higher activities of daily living than the cdr-1 group exhibited at baseline. furthermore, the cdr-0.5 group showed milder neuropsychiatric symptoms at the end of follow-up than the cdr-1 group showed at baseline.   conclusions the cerad total score is a suitable and sensitive follow-up tool in longitudinal ad trials. cognition progression rates did not significantly differ between study groups; however, patients with very mild ad at baseline had milder neuropsychiatric symptoms after long-term follow-up. this emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms at the diagnostic visit and during follow-up.
tolerability and pharmacokinetics of lobeglitazone, a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist, after a single oral administration in healthy female subjects background lobeglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (ppar-γ) agonist with partial ppar-α affinity, was developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.   objective this study's aim was to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic (pk) properties of lobeglitazone to satisfy regulatory requirements for marketing approval in korea.   methods a block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose study was conducted in healthy subjects. in the pilot study, 4 subjects were administered 0.5 mg, including 1 receiving a placebo. then, the single-dose study was conducted with 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg doses (8 subjects in each group, including 2 receiving placebos), followed by the multiple-dose study with 1, 2, and 4 mg doses (once daily for 7 days; 8 subjects in each group, including 2 receiving placebos). serial samples of blood and urine were collected and drug concentrations were determined by high turbulence liquid chromatography-lc/ms/ms. tolerability assessments were performed throughout the study. adverse events (aes) were determined from general health-related questions and self-reports.   results thirty-six (mean [sd]; age, 23.6 [2.7] years; weight, 70.0 [6.9] kg) and 25 korean male subjects (age, 23.5 [3.1] years; weight 69.4 [9.4] kg) were enrolled in the single- and multiple-dose studies, respectively. the data from subjects administered lobeglitazone who completed the study (27, single; 18, multiple) was included in the pk analyses. in the single-dose study, the auc and c(max) of lobeglitazone increased with the dose. after repeated dosing for 7 days, the accumulation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. a total of 25 aes were reported by 11 (30.6%) and 8 subjects (33.3%) in the single- and multiple-dose studies, respectively. all aes were mild in intensity and not serious.   conclusions lobeglitazone was well tolerated in this small, selected group of healthy male korean volunteers. the auc and c(max) of lobeglitazone increased in a dose-proportional manner from 1 to 4 mg.
relationship between tei index and left ventricular geometric patterns in a hypertensive population: a cross-sectional study to determine the accuracy of echocardiographic left ventricular (lv) dimension and mass measurements for detection and quantification of lv hypertrophy, results of blindly read antemortem echocardiograms were compared with lv mass measurements made at necropsy in 55 patients. lv mass was calculated using m-mode lv measurements by penn and american society of echocardiography (ase) conventions and cube function and volume correction formulas in 52 patients. penn-cube lv mass correlated closely with necropsy lv mass (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001) and overestimated it by only 6%; sensitivity in 18 patients with lv hypertrophy (necropsy lv mass more than 215 g) was 100% (18 of 18 patients) and specificity was 86% (29 of 34 patients). ase-cube lv mass correlated similarly to necropsy lv mass (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001), but systematically overestimated it (by a mean of 25%); the overestimation could be corrected by the equation: lv mass = 0.80 (ase-cube lv mass) + 0.6 g. use of ase measurements in the volume correction formula systematically underestimated necropsy lv mass (by a mean of 30%). in a subset of 9 patients, 3 of whom had technically inadequate m-mode echocardiograms, 2-dimensional echocardiographic (echo) lv mass by 2 methods was also significantly related to necropsy lv mass (r = 0.68, p less than 0.05 and r = 0.82, p less than 0.01). among other indexes of lv anatomy, only measurement of myocardial cross-sectional area was acceptably accurate for quantitation of lv mass (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) or diagnosis of lv hypertrophy (sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 94%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis. progressive tissue fibrosis can compromise epithelial function resulting in organ failure. appreciating evidence suggests that fibroblasts provide fibrogenic collagens during such injury. we further tested this notion by attempting to reduce the physiologic consequences of organ fibrosis through the selective killing of fibroblasts at sites of injury. here, we report the conditional reduction of tissue fibroblasts using the coding sequence for herpesvirus thymidine kinase (deltatk) put under the control of a cell-specific promoter from the gene encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). transgenic fibroblasts from mice carrying fsp1.deltatk minigenes expressed thymidine kinase concordantly with native fsp1 and, compared to transgenic epithelium, were selectively susceptible to the lethal effects of nucleoside analogs either in culture or during experimental renal fibrosis. the numbers of fibroblasts in fibrogenic kidney tissue were reduced on exposure to nucleoside analogs as was the degree of type i collagen deposition and the extent of fibrosis. fibroblast reduction following the stress of dna chain termination highlights the important contribution of cell division during fibrogenesis. our findings convey a proof of principle regarding the importance of fsp1(+) fibroblasts in fibrosis as well as providing a new approach to treating the relentless scarification of tissue.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
ck2 activates kinesin via induction of a conformational change kinesin-1 is a dimeric motor protein that moves cargo processively along microtubules. kinesin motility has been proposed to be driven by the coordinated forward extension of the neck linker (a ∼12-residue peptide) in one motor domain and the rearward positioning of the neck linker in the partner motor domain. to test this model, we have introduced fluorescent dyes selectively into one subunit of the kinesin dimer and performed 'half-molecule' fluorescence resonance energy transfer to measure conformational changes of the neck linker. we show that when kinesin binds with both heads to the microtubule, the neck linkers in the rear and forward heads extend forward and backward, respectively. during atp-driven motility, the neck linkers switch between these conformational states. these results support the notion that neck linker movements accompany the 'hand-over-hand' motion of the two motor domains.
marked reduction of akt1 expression and deregulation of akt1-associated pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of schizophrenia patients the comprehensive assessment of symptoms and history was developed for research studies of schizophrenia spectrum conditions and affective spectrum conditions. it is designed to provide a comprehensive information base concerning current and past signs and symptoms, premorbid functioning, cognitive functioning, sociodemographic status, treatment, and course of illness. because the information base is broad, it is not wedded to a specific diagnostic system but rather permits clinicians and investigators to make diagnoses using a wide range of systems, including research diagnostic criteria, dsm-iii, dsm-iii-r, and the international classification of diseases. given the fact that disorders in psychiatry are not defined at the etiological or pathophysiological level, diagnostic criteria are prone to ongoing revision as our knowledge base changes. research strategies suggest that investigators should maintain a flexible database to permit them to adapt to changes in diagnostic systems, to do comparative nosological studies, and, ultimately, to develop new diagnostic systems based on knowledge concerning the underlying neurobiological nature of disorders. because it provides a comprehensive information base, the comprehensive assessment of symptoms and history facilitates research of this type. extensive developmental work has been done with the comprehensive assessment of symptoms and history, including interrater and test-retest reliability studies, validity studies, training programs, and data entry programs.
molecular design and qsars/qsprs with molecular descriptors family. binding affinity of triphenyl acrylonitriles to estrogen receptors: quantitative structure-activity relationships aim: the quantitative structure-activity relationship approach was applied to understand the relative binding affinity of triphenyl acrylonitriles to estrogen receptors. material and methods: a sample of previously studied triphenyl acrylonitriles was divided into training (18 compounds) and test sets (7 compounds) using a stratified random approach. the molecular descriptor family on vertices cutting (mdfv) approach was used in order to translate the structural information into descriptors. the relationship between binding activity and structural descriptors was identified using the multiple linear regression procedure. results: an optimal three-parameter equation with a determination coefficient of 0.9580 and a cross-validation leave-one-out parameter of 0.9408 was identified. the optimal model was assessed on a test set and a determination coefficient of 0.9004 was obtained. the mdfv model proved not to be significantly different from the previously reported model in terms of goodness-of-fit. in terms of information criteria (akaike's, bayesian, amemiya, and hannan-quinn) and kubinyi function, the mdfv model proved to perform better than the previously reported model. conclusion: the optimal mdfv model was able to explain ~96% of the total variance in the estrogenic binding relative affinity of triphenyl acrylonitriles and to have estimation and prediction abilities. although there were no significant differences in terms of goodness-of-fit, the mdfv model proved to exhibit better information parameters compared to the previously reported model using the same number of molecular descriptors. сходство связывания трифенил акрилонитрила с рецепторами эстрогена - зависимость между химической структурой и свой ствами цель: исследовать относительное сходство связы вания трифенил акрилонитрила с рецепторами эстрогена с помощью анализа зависимости между химической структурой и свойствами. материал и методы: определенное количество уже исследованного трифенил акрилонитрила разделено на случайном принципе на учебные и тестовые комплекты (соответственно17 и 18 соединений). с целью привести структурную информацию в структурные дескрипторы авторы использовали анализ молекулярной дескрипторной группы (mdfv).зависимость связывания рецептора с структурным дескриптором определена с помощью полимерного линейного регрессионного анализа. результаты: выведено оптимальное трипара-метрическое уравнение с детерминационным коэф фициентом0.9580 и скрещенным достоверным пара метром 0.9408. оптимальная модель испробована на тестовом комплекте соединений, при чем получе на стоимость детерминационного коэффициента0.9004. не отмечена сигнификантная разница междуmdfv моделью и уже изученной моделью по отношению к статистическому соотношению. в отношении информационных критериев (критерииakaike, bayes, amemiya, and hannan-quinn) и функции kubinyi модель mdfv оказалась лучше, чем изученная раньше модель. заключение: оптимальнаяmdfv модель ус пела объяснить приблизительно96% общей дис персии относительного сходства связывания три фенил акрилонитрила с рецепторами эстрогена, кроме того она демонстрирует оценочные и прог ностические свойства. хотя и не отмечены сигнифи-кантные разницы в статистической адекватности, оказалось, что эта модель имеет более хорошие информационные параметры, чем уже изученная модель, которая использует то же самое число молекулярных дескрипторов.
utility of portable spirometry in a pediatric emergency department in children with acute exacerbation of asthma a bstract background anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium improve the pulmonary function of patients with acute exacerbations of asthma, but their effect on hospitalization rates is uncertain. methods we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 434 children (2 to 18 years old) who had acute exacerbations of moderate or severe asthma treated in the emergency department. all the children received a nebulized solution of albuterol (2.5 or 5 mg per dose, depending on body weight) every 20 minutes for three doses and then as needed. a corticosteroid (2 mg of prednisone or prednisolone per kilogram of body weight) was given orally with the second dose of albuterol. children in the treatment group received 500 m g (2.5 ml) of ipratropium bromide with the second and third doses of albuterol; children in the control group received 2.5 ml of normal saline at these times. results overall, the rate of hospitalization was lower in the ipratropium group (59 of 215 children [27.4 percent]) than in the control group (80 of 219 [36.5 percent], p=0.05). for patients with moderate asthma (indicated by a peak expiratory flow rate of 50 to 70 percent of the predicted value or an asthma score of 8 to 11 on a 15-point scale), hospitalization rates were similar in the two groups (ipratropium: 8 of 79 children [10.1 percent]; control: 9 of 84 [10.7 percent]). for patients with severe asthma (defined as a peak expiratory flow rate of <50 percent of the predicted value or an asthma score of 12 to 15), the addition of ipratropium significantly reduced the need for hospitalization (51 of 136 children [37.5 percent], as compared with 71 of 135 [52.6 percent] in the control group; p=0.02). conclusions among children with a severe exacerbation of asthma, the addition of ipratropium bromide to albuterol and corticosteroid therapy significantly decreases the hospitalization rate.

flaw selection strategies for partial-order planning we describe the least-cost flaw repair (lcfr) strategy for performing flaw selection during partial-order causal link (pocl) planning. lcfr can be seen as a generalization of peot and smith's "delay unforced threats" (dunf) strategy (peot & smith 1993); where dunf treats threats differently from open conditions, lcfr has a uniform mechanism for handling all flaws. we provide experimental results that demonstrate that the power of dunf does not come from delaying threat repairs per se, but rather from the fact that this delay has the effect of imposing a partial preference for least-cost flaw selection. our experiments also show that extending this to a complete preference for least-cost selection reduces search-space size even further. we consider the computational overhead of employing lcfr, and discuss techniques for reducing this overhead. in particular, we describe qlcfr, a strategy that reduces computational overhead by approximating repair costs.
the role of atm in the deficiency in nonhomologous end-joining near telomeres in a human cancer cell line recent studies have implicated a poorly defined alternative pathway of nonhomologous end joining (alt-nhej) in the generation of large deletions and chromosomal translocations that are frequently observed in cancer cells. here, we describe an interaction between two factors, hmre11/hrad50/nbs1 (mrn) and dna ligase iiiα/xrcc1, that have been linked with alt-nhej. expression of dna ligase iiiα and the association between mrn and dna ligase iiiα/xrcc1 are altered in cell lines defective in the major nhej pathway. most notably, dna damage induced the association of these factors in dna ligase iv-deficient cells. mrn interacts with dna ligase iiiα/xrcc1, stimulating intermolecular ligation, and together these proteins join incompatible dna ends in a reaction that mimics alt-nhej. thus, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the alt-nhej pathway that not only contributes to genome instability in cancer cells but may also be a therapeutic target.
widespread occurrence of intersex in black basses (micropterus spp.) from u.s. rivers, 1995-2004. common carp (cyprinus carpio), black bass (micropterus spp.), and channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus) were collected from 14 sites in the colorado river basin (crb) to document spatial trends in accumulative contaminants, health indicators, and reproductive biomarkers. organochlorine residues, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-like activity (tcdd-eq), and elemental contaminants were measured in composite samples of whole fish, grouped by species and gender, from each site. selenium (se) and mercury (hg) concentrations in fish were elevated throughout the crb, and pesticide concentrations were greatest in fish from agricultural areas in the lower colorado river and gila river. selenium concentrations exceeded toxicity thresholds for fish (>1.0 microg/g ww) at all crb sites except the gila river at hayden, arizona. mercury concentrations were elevated (>0.1 microg/g ww) in fish from the yampa river at lay, colorado; the green river at ouray national wildlife refuge (nwr), utah and san rafael, utah; the san juan river at hogback diversion, new mexico; and the colorado river at gold bar canyon, utah, needles, california, and imperial dam, arizona. concentrations of p,p'-dde were relatively high in fish from the gila river at arlington, arizona (>1.0 microg/g ww) and phoenix, arizona (>0.5 microg/g ww). concentrations of other formerly used pesticides including toxaphene, total chlordanes, and dieldrin were also greatest at these two sites but did not exceed toxicity thresholds. currently used pesticides such as dacthal, endosulfan, gamma-hch, and methoxychlor were also greatest in fish from the gila river downstream of phoenix. total polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs; >0.11 microg/g ww) and tcdd-eqs (>5 pg/g ww) exceeded wildlife guidelines in fish from the gila river at phoenix. hepatic ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (erod) activity was also relatively high in carp from the gila river at phoenix and in bass from the green river at ouray nwr. fish from some sites showed evidence of contaminant exposure as indicated by fish health indicators and reproductive biomarker results. multiple health indicators including altered body and organ weights and high health assessment index scores may be associated with elevated se concentrations in fish from the colorado river at loma, colorado and needles. although grossly visible external or internal lesions were found on most fish from some sites, histopathological analysis determined many of these to be inflammatory responses associated with parasites. edema, exophthalmos, and cataracts were noted in fish from sites with elevated se concentrations. intersex fish were found at seven of 14 sites and included smallmouth bass (m. dolomieu), largemouth bass (m. salmoides), catfish, and carp and may indicate exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds. a high proportion of smallmouth bass from the yampa river at lay (70%) was intersex but the cause of this condition is unknown. male carp, bass, and catfish with low concentrations of vitellogenin were common in the crb. comparatively high vitellogenin concentrations (>0.2 mg/ml) were measured in male bass from the green river at ouray nwr and the colorado river at imperial dam and indicate exposure to estrogenic or anti-androgenic chemicals. anomalous reproductive biomarkers including low gsi and gonadal abnormalities (calcifications, edema, and parasites) observed in fish downstream of phoenix are likely related to the poor water-quality of the gila river in this area.
depressive symptoms are associated with analgesic use in people with alzheimer’s disease: kuopio alsova study the 15d is a generic, comprehensive, 15-dimensional, standardized, self-administered measure of health-related quality of life (hrqol) that can be used both as a profile and single index score measure. this paper examines the acceptability, reliability, validity, discriminatory power and responsiveness to change of its health state descriptive system and valuation system and presents some examples of applications. as a profile measure on roughly comparable dimensions the 150 performs equally well as the nottingham health profile (nhp) and sf-20, in some respects even better, and clearly better than eq-5d. the remaining nine to ten dimensions of the 15d provide a large reserve in terms of discriminatory power and responsiveness to change. the valuation system is based on an application of the multiattribute utility theory. the single index score (15d score) on a 0–1 scale, representing the overall hrqol, is calculated from the health state descriptive system by using a set of population-based preference or utility weights. the 15d scores are shown to be highly reliable, sensitive and responsive to change, generalisable at least in western-type societies, and particularly valid for deriving quality-adjusted life years (qalys) gained for resource allocation purposes. the instrument is recommended by the washington panel and is available in several languages for clinical economic evaluation and population studies.

no changes in lung function after a saturation dive to 2.5 mpa with intermittent reduction in  $$ p_{{{{\rm o}}_{{{\rm 2}}} }} $$ during decompression lung volumes are subdivided into static and dynamic lung volumes. static lung volumes are measured by methods which are based on the completeness of respiratory manoeuvres, so that the velocity of the manoeuvres should be adjusted accordingly. the measurements taken during fast breathing movements are described as dynamic lung volumes and as forced inspiratory and expiratory flows.  ### 1.1 static lung volumes and capacities  the volume of gas in the lung and intrathoracic airways is determined by the properties of lung parenchyma and surrounding organs and tissues, surface tension, the force exerted by respiratory muscles, by lung reflexes and by the properties of airways. the gas volumes of thorax and lung are the same except in the case of a pneumothorax. if two or more subdivisions of the total lung capacity are taken together, the sum of the constituent volumes is described as a lung capacity. lung volumes and capacities are described in more detail in § 2.  #### 1.1.1 determinants  factors which determine the size of the normal lung include stature, age, sex, body mass, posture, habitus, ethnic group, reflex factors and daily activity pattern. the level of maximal inspiration (total lung capacity, tlc) is influenced by the force developed by the inspiratory muscles (disorders include e.g. muscular dystrophy), the elastic recoil of the lung (disorders include e.g. pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema) and the elastic properties of the thorax and adjacent structures (disorders include e.g. ankylosis of joints). the level of maximal expiration (residual volume, rv) is determined by the force exerted by respiratory muscles (disorders include e.g. muscle paralysis), obstruction, occlusion and compression of small airways (disorders include e.g. emphysema) and by the mechanical properties of lung and thorax (disorders include diffuse fibrosis, kyphoscoliosis).  assessing the total lung capacity is indispensable in establishing a restrictive ventilatory defect or in diagnosing abnormal lung distensibility, as may occur in patients …
a helping hand in assessing children's knowledge: instructing adults to attend to gesture abstract this study investigates two implications of frequent mismatches between gesture and speech in a child's explanations of a concept: (1) do gesture/speech mismatches reflect a basic inconsistency in the explanatory system which underlies a child's understanding of a concept? (2) do gesture/speech mismatches, perhaps as a consequence of this inconsistency, reflect a heightened receptivity to instruction in that concept? the piagetian conservation task, which asks children to explain their judgments about quantity invariance, was used to test these hypotheses. children ages 5–8 were asked to make six conservation judgments and then to explain each of those judgments. all but one of the children were found to gesture spontaneously with their spoken explanations. children were classified into two groups according to the relationship between gesture and speech in their explanations: “discordant” children produced many explanations in which the information conveyed in speech did not match the information conveyed in gesture; “concordant” children produced few such mismatched explanations. study 1 sought to determine whether discordant children were less consistent in the reasoning underlying their verbal explanations of quantity invariance than were concordant children. two indices of consistency that were independent of the discordance classifications were devised and applied to the performances of 28 children on the six conservation tasks. the discordant children were found to have significantly lower scores on both indices of consistency than the concordant children. thus, children who frequently produced mismatched information between gesture and speech in their explanations of a concept tended to display other forms of inconsistency with respect to the explanatory systems they used to justify their beliefs about that concept. study 2 sought to determine whether this inconsistency reflected knowledge in transition as operationalized by heightened receptivity to training. after participating in a pretest of six conservation tasks, 52 children were exposed to training in conservation. discordant children were found to show more improvement than concordant children on a posttest containing the same 6 conservation tasks. thus, gesture/speech discordance appears to be both a useful marker of inconsistency in the explanatory system underlying understanding of a concept and of receptivity to training in that concept.
instance-level video segmentation from object tracks pixel-level labelling tasks, such as semantic segmentation, play a central role in image understanding. recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. one central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. to solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (cnns) and conditional random fields (crfs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. to this end, we formulate conditional random fields with gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as recurrent neural networks. this network, called crf-rnn, is then plugged in as a part of a cnn to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both cnns and crfs. importantly, our system fully integrates crf modelling with cnns, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. we apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging pascal voc 2012 segmentation benchmark.
a similarity metric method of obfuscated malware using function-call graph windows binary malware has come a long way. today’s average worm is often tens or hundreds of kilobytes of code exhibiting a level of complexity that surpasses even some operating systems. this degree of complexity, coupled with the overwhelming flow of new malware, calls for improvements to tools and techniques used in analysis. our paper elaborates on how to use graph theory to aid the analysis. using graphs and extensions with the popular interactive disassembler pro package, we hope to reduce the time needed to understand the structure of complex malware. these methods have proven to be helpful in finding similarities and differences between different malware variants and strains. focusing on the differences by keeping off already known code allows rapid analysis and classification of malware, while reducing redundant efforts.
endoscopic management of antrochoanal polyps: a single uk centre’s experience antrochoanal polyps (acp) are benign lesions that arise from the mucosa of the maxillary sinus, grow into the maxillary sinus and reach the choana, and nasal obstruction being their main symptom. it is an interesting model to compare the pathophysiological mechanisms with those of bilateral nasal polyposis (np). there is a lack of research in some areas of acp, which have to become the main aims for future investigations of this disease. in comparison to np, acps are usually unilateral and appear in younger patients. macroscopically, they have a cystic intramaxillary portion and a solid intranasal portion. microscopically, they are similar to a maxillary cyst of the mucosa. nasal endoscopy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the main diagnostic techniques. surgery is the indicated treatment for acp, with endoscopic resection the most recommended. simple avulsion of the polyp has a high rate of recurrence, whereas the caldwell-luc procedure is associated with damage of the maxillary and dental growth centres. more research is needed to establish the relationship between chronic sinusitis and acp. further work is also needed to investigate the role of inflammatory mediators (histamine, ige, adhesion molecules, paf), as well as metalloproteases and nasal remodelling, and tumour marker expression in a cp.
financial team incentives improved recording of diagnoses in primary care: a quasi-experimental longitudinal follow-up study with controls abstract the rate of recovery of motor function after crushing the sciatic nerve was measured in rats treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of 3,3′,5-triiodo- l -thyronine, 25 μg/kg. the nerve was crushed at one of four levels, and recovery of motor function was indicated by the return of toe spreading elicited as part of the vestibular placing response. the rate of recovery was calculated from the linear regression of the time to recovery on the distance from the lesion to the entry of the peroneal nerve into the anterior tibial muscle. the recovery rate of the triiodothyronine-treated group was 4.08 ± 0.22 ( se ) mm/day, an increase of 22% from the rate of 3.35 ± 0.14 mm/day ( p = 0.006) in the vehicle-injected control rats. the latent periods for the two groups were not significantly different. the outgrowth of the most rapidly growing sensory axons was measured using the “pinch test” on the 7th or 9th day after sciatic crush in animals treated with triiodothyronine in dosages from 1 to 400 μg/kg/day and compared with control animals. no significant difference in distance regenerated or rate of regeneration was found. control nerves regenerated at a rate of 4.5 ± 0.15 mm/day after a delay of 2.0 ± 0.2 days. a significant degree of hyperthyroidism was documented by measurements of plasma triiodothyronine concentrations taken 4 and 18 h after the injection of the hormone, 25 μg/kg. at the same dosage animals gained weight normally and showed no signs of thyrotoxicity. these results are interpreted as showing that the accelerated recovery of motor function in the hyperthyroid rat is mediated via an effect on the maturation of the regenerated axon rather than on axonal outgrowth. a triiodothyronine-related increase in the rate of myelination would be consistent with the observed results.
long term outcomes of a geriatric liaison intervention in frail elderly cancer patients this article describing the first phase in the development of an assessment scale of nursing-care dependency (ncd) for dutch demented and mentally handicapped patients focuses on the background to the study and the content validation of the nursing-care dependency scale. the scale aims to characterize the patients' nursing-care dependency as part of the assessment step in the nursing process, and is based on henderson's 14 human needs. the delphi technique, using two panels of experts (n = 44), was applied to reach consensus on significant indicators of nursing-care dependency. the experts' reasoning was used to develop criteria for the assessment of nursing-care dependency. ultimately, the delphi rounds generated 15 ncd items with their descriptions and item criteria. there was no fundamental difference between the ncd scales for demented and mentally handicapped patients. nevertheless, there are two versions of the ncd scale because of the need to apply specific concepts in the nursing care of either population. the original dutch version of the ncd is also available in english and in norwegian.
reactive sc : speculatively relaxing memory consistency model contraints using dynamic classification of cache blocks sequential consistency (sc) is arguably the most intuitive behavior for a shared-memory multithreaded program. it is widely accepted that language-level sc could significantly improve programmability of a multiprocessor system. however, efficiently supporting end-to-end sc remains a challenge as it requires that both compiler and hardware optimizations preserve sc semantics. while a recent study has shown that a compiler can preserve sc semantics for a small performance cost, an efficient and complexity-effective sc hardware remains elusive. past hardware solutions relied on aggressive speculation techniques, which has not yet been realized in a practical implementation. this paper exploits the observation that hardware need not enforce any memory model constraints on accesses to thread-local and shared read-only locations. a processor can easily determine a large fraction of these safe accesses with assistance from static compiler analysis and the hardware memory management unit. we discuss a low-complexity hardware design that exploits this information to reduce the overhead in ensuring sc. our design employs an additional unordered store buffer for fast-tracking thread-local stores and allowing later memory accesses to proceed without a memory ordering related stall. our experimental study shows that the cost of guaranteeing end-to-end sc is only 6.2% on average when compared to a system with tso hardware executing a stock compiler's output.
population coding and decoding in a neural field: a computational study coarse codes are widely used throughout the brain to encode sensory and motor variables. methods designed to interpret these codes, such as population vector analysis, are either inefficient, i.e., the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possible variance, or biologically implausible, like maximum likelihood. moreover, these methods attempt to compute a scalar or vector estimate of the encoded variable. neurons are faced with a similar estimation problem. they must read out the responses of the presynaptic neurons, but, by contrast, they typically encode the variable with a further population code rather than as a scalar. we show how a non-linear recurrent network can be used to perform these estimation in an optimal way while keeping the estimate in a coarse code format. this work suggests that lateral connections in the cortex may be involved in cleaning up uncorrelated noise among neurons representing similar variables.
sick leave and disability pension in hodgkin lymphoma survivors by stage, treatment, and follow-up time—a population-based comparative study abstract: background –despite improved treatment results achieved in hodgkin's disease (hd), only about 70% of patients with advanced stages are cured. the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of advanced stages (iib–ivb) of hd in younger patients in an unselected population‐based group of patients. the patients were recommended individualized treatment with respect to number of chemotherapy (ct) courses and post‐ct radiotherapy (rt) based on pretreatment characteristics and tumour response. secondly, we investigated if variables of prognostic importance could be detected. patients and methods –between 1985–92, 307 patients between 17–59 yr of age (median 36) were diagnosed with hd in stages iib–ivb in 5/6 health care regions in sweden. median follow‐up time was 7.8 yr (1.3–13). retrospectively, laboratory parameters were collected. results –in total, 267 (87%) patients had a complete response (cr). the overall and disease‐free 10‐yr survivals in the whole cohort were 76% and 67%, respectively. there was no difference in survival between the groups of patients who received 6 or 8 cycles of ct. survival was not higher for patients in cr after ct when rt was added. for those in pr after ct, additional rt raised the frequencies of cr. a selected group of pathologically staged patients was successfully treated with a short course (2 cycles) of ct+rt. in univariate analyses survival was affected by age, stage ivb, bone‐marrow involvement, b‐symptoms, s‐ldh, s‐alb and reaching cr or not after 2, 4 and 6 cycles of ct. in a multivariate analysis, age and reaching cr after 6 cycles of ct remained statistically significant. conclusions –the lack of difference in survival between the groups of patients who received 6 versus 8 cycles of ct indicates a successful selection of patients for the shorter treatment. reaching a rapid cr significantly affected outcome. whether some patients need less ct than the generally recommended 8 courses can properly only be evaluated in a randomised study. additional rt may play a role in successful outcome, particularly if residual tumours are present, but its precise role can also only be defined in prospectively randomised studies. reaching cr after ct was the most important variable affecting survival besides age.
incremental construction of biological networks by relation extraction from literature novel data-mining tasks in e-science involve mining of distributed, highly heterogeneous data and knowledge sources. however, standard data mining platforms, such as weka and orange, involve only their own data mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data sources. in contrast, next generation data mining technologies should enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge discovery workflows for a given data mining task. this paper proposes a novel service-oriented knowledge discovery framework and its implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment orange4ws (orange for web services), based on the existing orange data mining toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual composition of data mining workflows. the new service-oriented data mining environment orange4ws includes the following new features: simple use of web services as remote components that can be included into a data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables automated composition of data mining workflows. these new features are showcased in three real-world scenarios.
expanding applications of deep brain stimulation: a potential therapeutic role in obesity and addiction management the central role of the hypothalamus in the origination and/or processing of feeding-related stimuli may be modulated by the activity of other functional areas of the brain including the insular cortex (involved in enteroceptive monitoring) and the prefrontal cortex (involved in the inhibition of inappropriate response tendencies). regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf), a marker of neuronal activity, was measured in 11 healthy, normal-weight men by using positron emission tomography in a state of hunger (after 36-h fast) and a state of satiation (after a liquid meal). hunger was associated with significantly increased rcbf in the vicinity of the hypothalamus and insular cortex and in additional paralimbic and limbic areas (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal and hippocampal formation), thalamus, caudate, precuneus, putamen, and cerebellum. satiation was associated with increased rcbf in the vicinity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. changes in plasma insulin concentrations in response to the meal were negatively correlated with changes in rcbf in the insular and orbitofrontal cortex. changes in plasma free fatty acid concentrations in response to the meal were negatively correlated with changes in rcbf in the anterior cingulate and positively correlated with changes in rcbf in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. in conclusion, these findings raise the possibility that several regions of the brain participate in the regulation of hunger and satiation and that insulin and free fatty acids may be metabolic modulators of postprandial brain neuronal events. although exploratory, the present study provides a foundation for investigating the human brain regions and cognitive operations that respond to nutritional stimuli.
benefits of a 12-week lifestyle modification program including diet and combined aerobic and resistance exercise on albuminuria in diabetic and non-diabetic japanese populations objective the metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and mortality. however, the association between microalbuminuria and the metabolic syndrome has not yet been reported in the general population in japan. therefore, we undertook a population-based study to examine the association between microalbuminuria and the metabolic syndrome in takahata, japan.   methods subjects of this cross-sectional study were individuals aged from 40 to 87 years old. the metabolic syndrome was defined according to the criteria of the adult treatment panel iii. microalbuminuria was defined as a urine albumin-creatinine ratio of 30 to 300 mg/g.   results a total of 2,321 subjects (mean age 64 years old) were entered into the final analysis. among them, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and microalbuminuria was 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. there was a significantly positive correlation between the number of components of the metabolic syndrome and the corresponding prevalence of microalbuminuria (p<0.001). in the subjects with metabolic syndrome compared with those without metabolic syndrome, the age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio of microalbuminuria was 1.99 (95% ci, 1.49-2.66). multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that high glucose, high blood pressure and obesity were independently associated with microalbuminuria.   conclusions our study revealed a strong relationship between microalbuminuria and the metabolic syndrome in the general population in japan. more comprehensive and intensive management of the metabolic syndrome at its early stage is important to prevent the progression of renal injury and cardiovascular complications.
ontology-based web site mapping for information exploration recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as c4.5. this fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. in this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning bayesian networks. these networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. among these approaches we single out a method we call tree augmented naive bayes (tan), which outperforms naive bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive bayes. we experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the university of california at irvine repository, and compared them to c4.5, naive bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection.
liposomal nasal spray versus guideline-recommended steroid nasal spray in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis: a comparison of tolerability and quality of life objectives chronic rhinosinusitis associated with asthma is often difficult to treat effectively with intranasal corticosteroids alone. thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combination treatment with an intranasal corticosteroid and a leukotriene-receptor antagonist (montelukast) in reducing the size of nasal polyps.   methods the subjects of this study were 20 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis associated with adult-onset asthma, which was being treated with inhaled corticosteroids. all patients were treated with intranasal fluticasone propionate, 200 microg/day, and montelukast, 10 mg/day, for 1 year. the size of nasal polyps and the score of sinus shadows were assessed with nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (ct), respectively, before and after treatment. the peripheral blood eosinophil counts were also evaluated before and after treatment.   results nasal polyps were significantly smaller after both 6 months (p<0.01) and 12 months of treatment (p<0.01) than before treatment. the decrease in the shadow score was statistically significant after both 6 months (p<0.01) and 12 months of treatment (p<0.01). significant reductions in peripheral blood eosinophil counts were also seen after both 6 months (p<0.05) and 12 months of treatment (p<0.01). a significant correlation was found between the rate of change in the peripheral blood eosinophil count and that in the ct score after both 6 months (r=0.578, p=0.012) and 12 months (r=0.625, p=0.007).   conclusion combined treatment with intranasal fluticasone propionate and montelukast, for at least 1 year, is effective for chronic rhinosinusitis associated with adult-onset asthma.
on the investigation of primed and chronic autonomous and heteronomous motivational orientations the research examines an unobtrusive measure of racial attitudes based on the evaluations that are automatically activated from memory on the presentation of black versus white faces. study 1, which concerned the technique's validity, obtained different attitude estimates for black and white participants and also revealed that the variability among white participants was predictive of other race-related judgments and behavior. study 2 concerned the lack of correspondence between the unobtrusive estimates and modern racism scale (mrs) scores. the reactivity of the mrs was demonstrated in study 3. study 4 observed an interaction between the unobtrusive estimates and an individual difference in motivation to control prejudiced reactions when predicting mrs scores. the theoretical implications of the findings for consideration of automatic and controlled components of racial prejudice are discussed, as is the status of the mrs.
morphology of the pancreas in type 2 diabetes: effect of weight loss with or without normalisation of insulin secretory capacity for the past 25 years nih image and imagej software have been pioneers as open tools for the analysis of scientific images. we discuss the origins, challenges and solutions of these two programs, and how their history can serve to advise and inform other software projects.
dsanls: accelerating distributed nonnegative matrix factorization via sketching non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) is the problem of determining two non-negative low rank factors w and h, for the given input matrix a, such that a ≈ wh. nmf is a useful tool for many applications in different domains such as topic modeling in text mining, background separation in video analysis, and community detection in social networks. despite its popularity in the data mining community, there is a lack of efficient distributed algorithms to solve the problem for big data sets. we propose a high-performance distributed-memory parallel algorithm that computes the factorization by iteratively solving alternating non-negative least squares (nls) subproblems for w and h. it maintains the data and factor matrices in memory (distributed across processors), uses mpi for interprocessor communication, and, in the dense case, provably minimizes communication costs (under mild assumptions). as opposed to previous implementations, our algorithm is also flexible: (1) it performs well for both dense and sparse matrices, and (2) it allows the user to choose any one of the multiple algorithms for solving the updates to low rank factors w and h within the alternating iterations. we demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm and compare it with baseline implementations, showing significant performance improvements.
analyzing 3d objects in cluttered images we describe a method for human pose estimation in static images based on a novel representation of part models. notably, we do not use articulated limb parts, but rather capture orientation with a mixture of templates for each part. we describe a general, flexible mixture model for capturing contextual co-occurrence relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations. we show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. when co-occurrence and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. we present experimental results on standard benchmarks for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude faster.
identification and characterization of conserved and variable regions of lime witches' broom phytoplasma genome. a polymerase chain reaction procedure was developed which enables specific amplification of a ribosomal sequence from the mycoplasmalike organism (mlo) associated with german grapevine yellows (vergilbungskrankheit, vk) and stolbur-related diseases of solanaceous plants. successful amplification from all samples prepared from various cultivars collected in different viticultural areas indicates that the causal agent is a relatively homogeneous organism. amplification was also achieved with template dna prepared from naturally infected weeds in vineyards such asconvolvolus arvensis andsolanum nigrum, and from the planthopperhyalesthes obsoletus that was collected in the vineyards. feeding of insects of this species on grapevine seedlings resulted in the development of typical yellows symptoms by the grapes.h. obsoletus could therefore be identified as a vector of vergilbungskrankheit.
a distributed protocol for storage aggregation in wireless sensor networks making effective use of the vast amounts of data gathered by large-scale sensor networks (sensornets) will require scalable, self-organizing, and energy-efficient data dissemination algorithms. for sensornets, where the content of the data is more important than the identity of the node that gathers them, researchers have found it useful to move away from the internet's point-to-point communication abstraction and instead adopt abstractions that are more data-centric. this approach entails naming the data and using communication abstractions that refer to those names rather than to node network addresses [1,11]. previous work on data-centric routing has shown it to be an energy-efficient data dissemination method for sensornets [12]. herein, we argue that a companion method, data-centric storage (dcs), is also a useful approach. under dcs, sensed data are stored at a node determined by the name associated with the sensed data. in this paper, we first define dcs and predict analytically where it outperforms other data dissemination approaches. we then describe ght, a geographic hash table system for dcs on sensornets. ght hashes keys into geographic coordinates, and stores a key–value pair at the sensor node geographically nearest the hash of its key. the system replicates stored data locally to ensure persistence when nodes fail. it uses an efficient consistency protocol to ensure that key–value pairs are stored at the appropriate nodes after topological changes. and it distributes load throughout the network using a geographic hierarchy. we evaluate the performance of ght as a dcs system in simulation against two other dissemination approaches. our results demonstrate that ght is the preferable approach for the application workloads we analytically predict, offers high data availability, and scales to large sensornet deployments, even when nodes fail or are mobile.

decision-making dysregulation in first-episode schizophrenia the variable results of positive-negative research with schizophrenics underscore the importance of well-characterized, standardized measurement techniques. we report on the development and initial standardization of the positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) for typological and dimensional assessment. based on two established psychiatric rating systems, the 30-item panss was conceived as an operationalized, drug-sensitive instrument that provides balanced representation of positive and negative symptoms and gauges their relationship to one another and to global psychopathology. it thus constitutes four scales measuring positive and negative syndromes, their differential, and general severity of illness. study of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be normally distributed and supported their reliability and stability. positive and negative scores were inversely correlated once their common association with general psychopathology was extracted, suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive constructs. review of five studies involving the panss provided evidence of its criterion-related validity with antecedent, genealogical, and concurrent measures, its predictive validity, its drug sensitivity, and its utility for both typological and dimensional assessment.
bioregion heterogeneity correlates with extensive mitochondrial dna diversity in the namaqua rock mouse, micaelamys namaquensis (rodentia: muridae) from southern africa - evidence for a species complex phylogenetic analyses are central to many research areas in biology and typically involve the identification of homologous sequences, their multiple alignment, the phylogenetic reconstruction and the graphical representation of the inferred tree. the phylogeny.fr platform transparently chains programs to automatically perform these tasks. it is primarily designed for biologists with no experience in phylogeny, but can also meet the needs of specialists; the first ones will find up-to-date tools chained in a phylogeny pipeline to analyze their data in a simple and robust way, while the specialists will be able to easily build and run sophisticated analyses. phylogeny.fr offers three main modes. the ‘one click’ mode targets non-specialists and provides a ready-to-use pipeline chaining programs with recognized accuracy and speed: muscle for multiple alignment, phyml for tree building, and treedyn for tree rendering. all parameters are set up to suit most studies, and users only have to provide their input sequences to obtain a ready-to-print tree. the ‘advanced’ mode uses the same pipeline but allows the parameters of each program to be customized by users. the ‘a la carte’ mode offers more flexibility and sophistication, as users can build their own pipeline by selecting and setting up the required steps from a large choice of tools to suit their specific needs. prior to phylogenetic analysis, users can also collect neighbors of a query sequence by running blast on general or specialized databases. a guide tree then helps to select neighbor sequences to be used as input for the phylogeny pipeline. phylogeny.fr is available at: http://www.phylogeny.fr/
advances in signatures, encryption, and e-cash from bilinear groups in 1998, blaze, bleumer, and strauss (bbs) proposed an application called atomic proxy re-encryption, in which a semitrusted proxy converts a ciphertext for alice into a ciphertext for bob without seeing the underlying plaintext. we predict that fast and secure re-encryption will become increasingly popular as a method for managing encrypted file systems. although efficiently computable, the wide-spread adoption of bbs re-encryption has been hindered by considerable security risks. following recent work of dodis and ivan, we present new re-encryption schemes that realize a stronger notion of security and demonstrate the usefulness of proxy re-encryption as a method of adding access control to a secure file system. performance measurements of our experimental file system demonstrate that proxy re-encryption can work effectively in practice.
autoencoders and recommender systems: cofils approach low-rank matrix approximation methods provide one of the simplest and most effective approaches to collaborative filtering. such models are usually fitted to data by finding a map estimate of the model parameters, a procedure that can be performed efficiently even on very large datasets. however, unless the regularization parameters are tuned carefully, this approach is prone to overfitting because it finds a single point estimate of the parameters. in this paper we present a fully bayesian treatment of the probabilistic matrix factorization (pmf) model in which model capacity is controlled automatically by integrating over all model parameters and hyperparameters. we show that bayesian pmf models can be efficiently trained using markov chain monte carlo methods by applying them to the netflix dataset, which consists of over 100 million movie ratings. the resulting models achieve significantly higher prediction accuracy than pmf models trained using map estimation.
inequalities in us life expectancy by area unemployment level, 1990–2010 this report presents health statistics from the 1997 national health interview survey for the civilian noninstitutionalized adult population, classified by sex, age, race and hispanic origin, poverty status, region of residence, and where appropriate, education, income, health insurance coverage, marital status, and place of residence. the topics covered are health status and limitations in activity, health care access and utilization, health behaviors and lifestyle, chronic condition prevalence, and knowledge and attitudes toward the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). source of data the nhis is a multistage probability sample survey conducted annually by interviewers of the u.s. census bureau for the national center for health statistics, centers for disease control and prevention, and is representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized u.s. population. data are collected during face-to-face interviews. highlights among adults 18 years of age or over, 12% had ever been told by a doctor or health professional that they had heart disease, 6% had ever been told they had coronary heart disease, and 19% had been told on two visits or more that they had hypertension. nearly a quarter of adults were current smokers, 23% were former smokers, and 52% had never smoked. sixty-one percent did not engage in any leisure-time vigorous physical activity, while approximately 24% engaged in such activity three times or more per week. based on estimates of body mass index, 4% of adults were underweight, 42% were at a healthy weight, 35% were overweight, and 19% were obese.
validation of an automated data collection method for quantifying social networks in collective behaviours latentnet is a package to fit and evaluate statistical latent position and cluster models for networks. hoff, raftery, and handcock (2002) suggested an approach to modeling networks based on positing the existence of an latent space of characteristics of the actors. relationships form as a function of distances between these characteristics as well as functions of observed dyadic level covariates. in latentnet social distances are represented in a euclidean space. it also includes a variant of the extension of the latent position model to allow for clustering of the positions developed in handcock, raftery, and tantrum (2007). the package implements bayesian inference for the models based on an markov chain monte carlo algorithm. it can also compute maximum likelihood estimates for the latent position model and a two-stage maximum likelihood method for the latent position cluster model. for latent position cluster models, the package provides a bayesian way of assessing how many groups there are, and thus whether or not there is any clustering (since if the preferred number of groups is 1, there is little evidence for clustering). it also estimates which cluster each actor belongs to. these estimates are probabilistic, and provide the probability of each actor belonging to each cluster. it computes four types of point estimates for the coefficients and positions: maximum likelihood estimate, posterior mean, posterior mode and the estimator which minimizes kullback-leibler divergence from the posterior. you can assess the goodness-of-fit of the model via posterior predictive checks. it has a function to simulate networks from a latent position or latent position cluster model.
microwave-driven coherent operation of a semiconductor quantum dot charge qubit. we study coherent dynamics of two spatially separated electrons in a coupled semiconductor double quantum dot (dqd). coherent oscillations in one dqd are strongly influenced by electronic states of the other dqd, or the two electrons simultaneously tunnel in a correlated manner. the observed coherent oscillations are interpreted as various two-qubit operations. the results encourage searching quantum entanglement in electronic devices.
context as a resource: a service-oriented approach for context-awareness. (information du contexte comme une ressource : une approche orientée service pour la sensibilité au contexte) this paper presents fractal, a hierarchical and reflective component model with sharing. components in this model can be endowed with arbitrary reflective capabilities, from plain black‐box objects to components that allow a fine‐grained manipulation of their internal structure. the paper describes julia, a java implementation of the model, a small but efficient runtime framework, which relies on a combination of interceptors and mixins for the programming of reflective features of components. the paper presents a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of this implementation, showing that component‐based programming in fractal can be made very efficient. copyright © 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.
lithium and gsk-3β promoter gene variants influence cortical gray matter volumes in bipolar disorder an automated coordinate‐based system to retrieve brain labels from the 1988 talairach atlas, called the talairach daemon (td), was previously introduced [lancaster et al., 1997 ]. in the present study, the td system and its 3‐d database of labels for the 1988 talairach atlas were tested for labeling of functional activation foci. td system labels were compared with author‐designated labels of activation coordinates from over 250 published functional brain‐mapping studies and with manual atlas‐derived labels from an expert group using a subset of these activation coordinates. automated labeling by the td system compared well with authors' labels, with a 70% or greater label match averaged over all locations. author‐label matching improved to greater than 90% within a search range of ±5 mm for most sites. an adaptive grey matter (gm) range‐search utility was evaluated using individual activations from the m1 mouth region (30 subjects, 52 sites). it provided an 87% label match to brodmann area labels (ba 4 & ba 6) within a search range of ±5 mm. using the adaptive gm range search, the td system's overall match with authors' labels (90%) was better than that of the expert group (80%). when used in concert with authors' deeper knowledge of an experiment, the td system provides consistent and comprehensive labels for brain activation foci. additional suggested applications of the td system include interactive labeling, anatomical grouping of activation foci, lesion‐deficit analysis, and neuroanatomy education. hum. brain mapping 10:120–131, 2000. © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc.
among 4 diet quality indexes, only the alternate mediterranean diet score is associated with better colorectal cancer survival and only in african american women in the multiethnic cohort. the performance of the dietary questionnaire used in a multiethnic cohort study in hawaii and los angeles was assessed in a calibration substudy that compared diet reported from the questionnaire with three 24-hour dietary recalls. for the calibration substudy, subjects from each of eight subgroups defined by sex and ethnic group (african-american, japanese-american, latino, and white) were chosen randomly from among the cohort members, and each participant's previous day's diet was assessed by telephone recall on three occasions over approximately 2 months. after completing the three 24-hour recalls, each calibration subject was sent a second questionnaire; 1,606 persons completed three recalls and a second questionnaire (127 to 267 per ethnic-sex group). this report describes correlation coefficients and calibration slopes for the relation between the 24-hour recalls and second questionnaire values for a selected set of macro- and micronutrients, as absolute intakes, nutrient densities, and calorie-adjusted nutrients. in all subgroups, estimates of the correlation between the questionnaire and 24-hour recalls were greater after energy adjustment (average correlations ranged from 0.57-0.74 for nutrient densities and from 0.55-0.74 for calorie-adjusted nutrients) than when absolute nutrient values were used (average range 0.26-0.57). for absolute nutrient intakes, the correlations were greatest for whites, somewhat lower for japanese-americans and latinos, and lowest for african-americans. after energy adjustment, the difference between subgroups were diminished, and the correlations were generally highly satisfactory.
local susceptibility causes diffusion alterations in patients with alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment background subjects with a mild cognitive impairment (mci) have a memory impairment beyond that expected for age and education yet are not demented. these subjects are becoming the focus of many prediction studies and early intervention trials.   objective to characterize clinically subjects with mci cross-sectionally and longitudinally.   design a prospective, longitudinal inception cohort.   setting general community clinic.   participants a sample of 76 consecutively evaluated subjects with mci were compared with 234 healthy control subjects and 106 patients with mild alzheimer disease (ad), all from a community setting as part of the mayo clinic alzheimer's disease center/alzheimer's disease patient registry, rochester, minn.   main outcome measures the 3 groups of individuals were compared on demographic factors and measures of cognitive function including the mini-mental state examination, wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised, wechsler memory scale-revised, dementia rating scale, free and cued selective reminding test, and auditory verbal learning test. clinical classifications of dementia and ad were determined according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, revised third edition and the national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and stroke-alzheimer's disease and related disorders association criteria, respectively.   results the primary distinction between control subjects and subjects with mci was in the area of memory, while other cognitive functions were comparable. however, when the subjects with mci were compared with the patients with very mild ad, memory performance was similar, but patients with ad were more impaired in other cognitive domains as well. longitudinal performance demonstrated that the subjects with mci declined at a rate greater than that of the controls but less rapidly than the patients with mild ad.   conclusions patients who meet the criteria for mci can be differentiated from healthy control subjects and those with very mild ad. they appear to constitute a clinical entity that can be characterized for treatment interventions.
no ecological opportunity signal on a continental scale? diversification and life‐history evolution of african true toads (anura: bufonidae) we report a major update of the mafft multiple sequence alignment program. this version has several new features, including options for adding unaligned sequences into an existing alignment, adjustment of direction in nucleotide alignment, constrained alignment and parallel processing, which were implemented after the previous major update. this report shows actual examples to explain how these features work, alone and in combination. some examples incorrectly aligned by mafft are also shown to clarify its limitations. we discuss how to avoid misalignments, and our ongoing efforts to overcome such limitations.
trends in pharmacotherapy in patients referred to a bipolar specialty clinic, 2000-2011. objective the clinical monitoring form (cmf) for mood disorders was developed as a time efficient record keeping tool for routine clinical use. this report presents preliminary data evaluating the correlation between the cmf's dimensional subscales for depression and mood elevation and formal mood rating scales across a wide spectrum of mood states.   methods to harvest data for 500 follow-up visits required collection of data from consecutive records accumulated during the conduct of seven double blind clinical trials involving a total of 58 participants. these trials utilized the cmf as a source document in conjunction with formal study outcome scales, e.g. hamilton rating scale for depression (hrsd), the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale (madrs), the young mania rating scale (ymrs) and the mania rating scale (mrs) from the schedule of affective disorders-current (sum-c). correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationship between the formal rating scales, clinical global impression and the depression (sum-d) and mood elevation (sum-me) subscales of the cmf.   results robust correlations were observed between sum-d and the formal depression scales, hrsd and madrs, r = 0.79, r = 0.88. respectively. similar robust correlations were also found between the sum-me and the formal mood elevation scales, ymrs and the mrs, r = 0.84, r = 0.86, respectively.   conclusion the cmf appears to offer a reasonable alternative to the formal rating scales typically used in research studies.
cognitive testing for dementia is adversely affected by administration in a foreign location age-adjusted normative data are presented for persons over age 55 on the mattis dementia rating scale. additional adjustment for the effect of education on test performance is also provided. these data were collected as part of mayo's older americans normative studies (moans) in a continuing effort to develop age-appropriate norms for older persons on commonly used neuropsychological tests. the normative data presented here should prove more useful in characterizing the presence and severity of general cognitive dysfunction than currently available norms. limitations and unique features of moans normative data are also discussed.
estimating iron and aluminum removal rates in the eastern equatorial pacific ocean using a box model approach the south china sea (scs) exhibits strong variations on seasonal to interannual time scale, and the changing southeast asian monsoon has direct impacts on the nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics, as well as the carbon cycle. a pacific basin-wide physical-biogeochemical model has been developed and used to investigate the physical variations, ecosystem responses, and carbon cycle consequences. the pacific basin-wide circulation model, based on the regional ocean model systems (roms) with a 50-km spatial resolution, is driven with daily air-sea fluxes derived from the national centers for environmental prediction (ncep) reanalysis between 1990 and 2004. the biogeochemical processes are simulated with the carbon, si(oh)4, nitrogen ecosystem (cosine) model consisting of multiple nutrients and plankton functional groups and detailed carbon cycle dynamics. the roms-cosine model is capable of reproducing many observed features and their variability over the same period at the southeast asian time-series study (seats) station in the scs. the integrated air-sea co2 flux over the entire scs reveals a strong seasonal cycle, serving as a source of co2 to the atmosphere in spring, summer and autumn, but acting as a sink of co2 for the atmosphere in winter. the annual mean sea-to-air co2 flux averaged over the entire scs is +0.33 moles co2 m−2year−1, which indicates that the scs is a weak source of co2 to the atmosphere. temperature has a stronger influence on the seasonal variation of pco2 than biological activity, and is thus the dominant factor controlling the oceanic pco2 in the scs. the water temperature, seasonal upwelling and kuroshio intrusion determine the pco2 differences at coast of vietnam and the northwestern region of the luzon island. the inverse relationship between the interannual variability of chl-a in summer near the coast of vietnam and nino3 sst (sea surface temperature) index in january implies that the carbon cycle and primary productivity in the scs is teleconnected to the pacific-east asian large-scale climatic variability.
detection of differentially methylated regions from bisulfite-seq data by hidden markov models incorporating genome-wide methylation level distributions we present a method for condensing the information in multiple alignments of proteins into a mixture of dirichlet densities over amino acid distributions. dirichlet mixture densities are designed to be combined with observed amino acid frequencies to form estimates of expected amino acid probabilities at each position in a profile, hidden markov model or other statistical model. these estimates give a statistical model greater generalization capacity, so that remotely related family members can be more reliably recognized by the model. this paper corrects the previously published formula for estimating these expected probabilities, and contains complete derivations of the dirichlet mixture formulas, methods for optimizing the mixtures to match particular databases, and suggestions for efficient implementation.
genomics of nsclc patients both affirm pd-l1 expression and predict their clinical responses to anti-pd-1 immunotherapy the sorting intolerant from tolerant (sift) algorithm predicts the effect of coding variants on protein function. it was first introduced in 2001, with a corresponding website that provides users with predictions on their variants. since its release, sift has become one of the standard tools for characterizing missense variation. we have updated sift’s genome-wide prediction tool since our last publication in 2009, and added new features to the insertion/deletion (indel) tool. we also show accuracy metrics on independent data sets. the original developers have hosted the sift web server at fhcrc, jcvi and the web server is currently located at bii. the url is http://sift-dna.org (24 may 2012, date last accessed).
vocal motor changes beyond the sensitive period for song plasticity. it is well established that there are remarkable similarities between song learning in oscine birds and acquisition of speech in young children. human speech shows marked changes with senescence, but few studies have evaluated how song changes with advanced age in songbirds. to investigate the effect of old age on song, we compared song of old bengalese finches (lonchura striata domestica) with that of middle-aged birds. the main observed difference was a decrease in the song tempo, largely due to an increased intersyllable duration. aging also affected the acoustic characteristics of the song, causing a decrease in pitch and in the range of frequency modulations. gross morphological measurements of selected vocal muscles did not show detectable changes over this age range, suggesting that song deterioration may be due to neural deterioration. the age-induced temporal and acoustic changes in song parallel the acoustic changes that occur in human speech, suggesting songbirds as a suitable model for aging studies on learned vocal behavior.
oligodendrocyte precursor cells synthesize neuromodulatory factors during early neural development, the lineage specification of initially pluripotent progenitor cells is associated with proliferation, differentiation, and migration. oligodendroglial progenitor cells migrate from their sites of origin to reach the axons that they will myelinate. we have described a cell‐surface protein, an2, expressed by oligodendroglial progenitor cells in vitro and showed that antibodies against an2 inhibited the migration of cultured primary oligodendroglial progenitor cells, suggesting that the an2 antigen plays a role in their migration. recently, results from maldi mass spectroscopy showed that an2 is the mouse homologue of the rat ng2 protein. in this study, we have analyzed cells staining with an2 antibodies during development and in the adult murine central nervous system (cns), carried out double stainings with antibodies against ng2, and investigated the differentiation potential of cells in vitro after isolation from early postnatal brain using an2 antibodies. an2 and ng2 antibodies stained totally overlapping populations of cells in the cns. an2/ng2 expressing cells in embryonic and postnatal brain expressed the pdgf‐α‐receptor and in postnatal brain exhibited electrophysiological properties typical of glial progenitor cells. cells isolated from early postnatal brain using an2 monoclonal antibody developed into oligodendrocytes in low serum medium or into astrocytes in the presence of fetal calf serum. in the embryonic spinal cord, cells staining with an2 antibodies were found closely apposed to radial glial cells, suggesting that glial precursors, like neurons, may use radial glia as scaffolds for migration. glia 34:213–228, 2001. © 2001 wiley‐liss, inc.
ethnic differences in the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin the disposition of a single intravenous bolus dose of 10 mg vitamin k1 and vitamin k1-2,3-epoxide were studied in two healthy subjects without and with 12 h pretreatment dose of phenprocoumon (0.4 mg/kg). for each compound administered alone the plasma concentration-time profile was adequately fitted by a biexponential equation, with an average terminal half-life of 2.0 and 1.15 h for the administered vitamin k and its 2,3-epoxide respectively. while vitamin k1 was measurable in plasma following administration of vitamin k1-2,3-epoxide, the epoxide was not detectable following administration of vitamin k1. following pretreatment with phenprocoumon and after intravenous administration of vitamin k1, both the average half-life and area under the plasma concentration-time profile of vitamin k1 were marginally reduced to 1.5 h and 1.76 mg l-1 h respectively, while the plasma concentration of vitamin k1-2,3-epoxide was readily measurable and its half-life markedly prolonged to 14.7 h. following pretreatment with phenprocoumon and after oral administration of vitamin k1-2,3-epoxide, no vitamin k1 was detectable in plasma and the half-life of the epoxide was 13.8 h. based on area considerations the data suggest that either phenprocoumon does more than just inhibit the reduction of vitamin k1-2,3-epoxide to vitamin k1, or that the simple model describing the interconversion between vitamin k1 and its epoxide is inadequate. the same conclusion is drawn from the analysis of comparable data in dogs, obtained by carlisle & blaschke (1981).
human capital and economic opportunity : a global working group working paper is the way that people make risky choices, or tradeoffs over time, related to cognitive ability? this paper investigates whether there is a link between cognitive ability, risk aversion, and impatience, using a representative sample of the population and incentive compatible measures. we conduct choice experiments measuring risk aversion, and impatience over an annual time horizon, for a randomly drawn sample of roughly 1,000 german adults. subjects also take part in two different tests of cognitive ability, which correspond to sub-modules of one of the most widely used iq tests. interviews are conducted in subjects' own homes. we find that lower cognitive ability is associated with greater risk aversion, and more pronounced impatience. these relationships are significant, and robust to controlling for personal characteristics, educational attainment, income, and measures of credit constraints. we perform a series of additional robustness checks, which help rule out other possible confounds.
noise effects on health in the context of air pollution exposure background: long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution may increase blood pressure (bp) and induce hypertension. however, evidence supporting these associations is limited, and they may be confounded by exposure to traffic noise and biased due to inappropriate control for use of bp-lowering medications. objectives: we evaluated the associations of long-term traffic-related air pollution with bp and prevalent hypertension, adjusting for transportation noise and assessing different methodologies to control for bp-lowering medications. methods: we measured systolic (sbp) and diastolic bp (dbp) at baseline (years 2003–2005) in 3,700 participants, 35–83 years of age, from a population-based cohort in spain. we estimated home outdoor annual average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (no2) with a land-use regression model. we used multivariate linear and logistic regression. results: a 10-μg/m3 increase in no2 levels was associated with 1.34 mmhg (95% ci: 0.14, 2.55) higher sbp in nonmedicated individuals, after adjusting for transportation noise. results were similar in the entire population after adjusting for medication, as commonly done, but weaker when other methods were used to account for medication use. for example, when 10 mmhg were added to the measured sbp levels of medicated participants, the association was β = 0.78 (95% ci: –0.43, 2.00). no2 was not associated with hypertension. associations of no2 with sbp and dbp were stronger in participants with cardiovascular disease, and the association with sbp was stronger in those exposed to high traffic density and traffic noise levels ≥ 55 db(a). conclusions: we observed a positive association between long-term exposure to no2 and sbp, after adjustment for transportation noise, which was sensitive to the methodology used to account for medication. citation: foraster m, basagaña x, aguilera i, rivera m, agis d, bouso l, deltell a, marrugat j, ramos r, sunyer j, vila j, elosua r, künzli n. 2014. association of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution with blood pressure and hypertension in an adult population–based cohort in spain (the regicor study). environ health perspect 122:404–411; http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1306497
feature-based signal selection for post-silicon debug using machine learning a major challenge in post-silicon debug is the lack of observability to the internal signals of a chip. trace buffer technology provides one venue to address this challenge by online tracing of a few selected state elements. due to the limited bandwidth of the trace buffer, only a few state elements can be selected for tracing. recent research has focused on automated trace signal selection problem to maximize restoration of the untraced state elements using the few traced signals. existing techniques can be categorized into high quality but slow simulation-based techniques and lower quality but much faster metric-based techniques. this paper presents a new trace signal selection technique which has comparable or better quality than simulation-based while it has a fast runtime, comparable to the metric-based techniques.
swarm aggregation using emotional learning based intelligent controller in this paper, we consider a control strategy of multiagent systems, or simply, swarms, based on artificial potential functions and the sliding-mode control technique. first, we briefly discuss a "kinematic" swarm model in n-dimensional space introduced in an earlier paper. in that model, the interindividual interactions are based on artificial potential functions, and the motion of the individuals is along the negative gradient of the combined potential. after that, we consider a general model for vehicle dynamics of each agent (swarm member), and use sliding-mode control theory to force their motion to obey the dynamics of the kinematic model. in this context, the results for the initial model serve as a "proof of concept" for multiagent coordination and control (swarm aggregation), whereas the present results serve as a possible implementation method for engineering swarms with given vehicle dynamics. the presented control scheme is robust with respect to disturbances and system uncertainties.
effects of the common polymorphism in the human aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (aldh2) gene on the lung proteomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients may provide new biomarkers and deeper understanding of the disease mechanisms but remains challenging. here we describe an ion-current-based strategy for comparative analysis of balf proteomes from patients with moderate and stable copd versus healthy controls. the strategy includes an efficient preparation procedure providing quantitative recovery and a nano-lc/ms analysis with a long, heated column. under optimized conditions, high efficiency and reproducibility were achieved for each step, enabling a "20-plex" comparison of clinical subjects (n = 10/group). without depletion/fractionation, a total of 423 unique protein groups were quantified under stringent criteria with at least two quantifiable peptides. seventy-six proteins were determined as significantly altered in copd, which represent a diversity of biological processes such as alcohol metabolic process, gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, inflammatory response, proteolysis, and oxidation reduction. interestingly, altered alcohol metabolism responding to oxidant stress is a novel observation in copd. the prominently elevated key enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism (e.g., adh1b, aldh2, and aldh3a1) may provide a reasonable explanation for a bewildering observation in copd patients known for decades: the underestimation of the blood alcohol concentrations through breath tests. these discoveries could provide new insights for identifying novel biomarkers and pathological mediators in clinical studies.
relationship between tei index and left ventricular geometric patterns in a hypertensive population: a cross-sectional study to determine the accuracy of echocardiographic left ventricular (lv) dimension and mass measurements for detection and quantification of lv hypertrophy, results of blindly read antemortem echocardiograms were compared with lv mass measurements made at necropsy in 55 patients. lv mass was calculated using m-mode lv measurements by penn and american society of echocardiography (ase) conventions and cube function and volume correction formulas in 52 patients. penn-cube lv mass correlated closely with necropsy lv mass (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001) and overestimated it by only 6%; sensitivity in 18 patients with lv hypertrophy (necropsy lv mass more than 215 g) was 100% (18 of 18 patients) and specificity was 86% (29 of 34 patients). ase-cube lv mass correlated similarly to necropsy lv mass (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001), but systematically overestimated it (by a mean of 25%); the overestimation could be corrected by the equation: lv mass = 0.80 (ase-cube lv mass) + 0.6 g. use of ase measurements in the volume correction formula systematically underestimated necropsy lv mass (by a mean of 30%). in a subset of 9 patients, 3 of whom had technically inadequate m-mode echocardiograms, 2-dimensional echocardiographic (echo) lv mass by 2 methods was also significantly related to necropsy lv mass (r = 0.68, p less than 0.05 and r = 0.82, p less than 0.01). among other indexes of lv anatomy, only measurement of myocardial cross-sectional area was acceptably accurate for quantitation of lv mass (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) or diagnosis of lv hypertrophy (sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 94%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
tales of the microprocessor : the narrative properties of computer simulation in this paper, i outline a perspective on organizational transformation which proposes change as endemic to the practice of organizing and hence as enacted through the situated practices of organizational actors as they improvise, innovate, and adjust their work routines over time. i ground this perspective in an empirical study which examined the use of a new information technology within one organization over a two-year period. in this organization, a series of subtle but nonetheless significant changes were enacted over time as organizational actors appropriated the new technology into their work practices, and then experimented with local innovations, responded to unanticipated breakdowns and contingencies, initiated opportunistic shifts in structure and coordination mechanisms, and improvised various procedural, cognitive, and normative variations to accommodate their evolving use of the technology. these findings provide the empirical basis for a practice-based perspective on organizational transfor...
analytical models for chip multiprocessor memory hierarchy design and management for academic computer architecture research, a large number of publicly available simulators make use of relatively simple abstractions for the microarchitecture of the processor pipeline. for some types of studies, such as those for multi-core cache coherence designs, a simple pipeline model may suffice. for detailed microarchitecture research, such as those that are sensitive to the exact behavior of out-of-order scheduling, alu and bypass network contention, and resource management (e.g., rs and rob entries), an over-simplified model is not representative of modern processor organizations. we present a new timing simulator that models a modern x86 microarchitecture at a very low level, including out-of-order scheduling and execution that much more closely mirrors current implementations, a detailed cache/memory hierarchy, as well as many x86-specific microarchitecture features (e.g., simple vs. complex decoders, micro-op decomposition and fusion, microcode lookup overhead for long/complex x86 instructions).
automata classification with convolutional neural networks for use in assistive technologies for the visually impaired we develop a common theoretical framework for combining classifiers which use distinct pattern representations and show that many existing schemes can be considered as special cases of compound classification where all the pattern representations are used jointly to make a decision. an experimental comparison of various classifier combination schemes demonstrates that the combination rule developed under the most restrictive assumptions-the sum rule-outperforms other classifier combinations schemes. a sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to estimation errors is carried out to show that this finding can be justified theoretically.
intramuscular pressure, force and blood flow in rabbit tibialis anterior muscles during single and repetitive contractions backgroundthe use of radioactive microspheres (rm) for the measurement of regional myocardial blood flow (rmbf) is limited and inaccessible to many investigators due to radiation safety concerns and radioactive waste disposal problems. therefore, a new method for the measurement of rmbf using colored microspheres (cm) was developed. methods and resultspolystyrene spheres (diameter, 15 ± 0.1 [sd] gm; density, 1.09 g/ml) were dyed with one of five colors. with the injection ofcm into the left atrium or into a coronary perfusion line, rmbf and its distribution can be determined. cm are extracted from the myocardium and blood by digestion with potassium hydroxide and subsequent microfiltration. the dyes are then recovered from the cm within a defined volume of a solvent, and their concentrations are determined by spectrophotometry. the separation of composite absorbance spectra by spectrophotometry with the cm technique was as good as the separation of energy spectra by a -ycounter using the rm technique. leaching of dye from the cm was less than 0.1% during a 2-month period in vitro. significant leaching of dye from the microspheres also did not occur during 8 hours in the blood and myocardium of four anesthetized dogs in vivo. for further validation of this method, pairs of cm and rm (15.5 ± 0.1 [sd] μm) were simultaneously injected under five different rmbf conditions (range, 0-10 ml/[min.g]) into the left anterior descending coronary artery of four anesthetized pigs, with coronary inflow as a flow reference, or into the left atrium of four anesthetized dogs using aortic blood withdrawal as a reference. the relation between rmbf determined by cm and rm was cm = 0.01 + 1.00 rm (r = 0.98, n = 1,080 data points) in the pigs, and cm=−0.19 + 0.92* rm (r = 0.97, n = 1,813 data points) in the dogs. conclusionsmeasurement of rmbf with cm yields values very similar to those of rm. their use is less expensive and avoids all the disadvantages related to radioactivity, thus offering an alternative method for as many as five rmbf measurements in a single experiment.

two-level speech recognition to enhance the performance of spoken dialogue systems this paper presents a generic model to combine robust speech understanding and mixed-initiative dialogue control in spoken dialogue systems. it relies on the use of semantic frames to conceptually store user interactions, a frame-unification procedure to deal with partial information, and a stack structure to handle initiative control. this model has been successfully applied in a dialogue system being developed at our lab, named saplen, which aims to deal with the telephone-based product orders and queries of fast food restaurants’ clients. in this paper we present the dialogue system and describe the new model, together with the results of a preliminary evaluation of the system concerning recognition time, word accuracy, implicit recovery and speech understanding. finally, we present the conclusions and indicate possibilities for future work.
feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of measurement-based care depression treatment for hiv patients in bamenda, cameroon background in high-income countries, depression is prevalent in hiv patients and is associated with lower medication adherence and clinical outcomes. emerging evidence from low-income countries supports similar relationships. yet little research has validated rapid depression screening tools integrated into routine hiv clinical care.   methods using qualitative methods, we adapted the patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9) depression screening instrument for use with cameroonian patients. we then conducted a cross-sectional validity study comparing an interviewer-administered phq-9 to the reference standard composite international diagnostic interview in 400 patients on antiretroviral therapy attending a regional hiv treatment center in bamenda, cameroon.   results the prevalence of major depressive disorder (mdd) in the past month was 3% (n=11 cases). using a standard cutoff score of ≥10 as a positive depression screen, the phq-9 had estimated sensitivity of 27% (95% confidence interval: 6-61%) and specificity of 94% (91-96%), corresponding to positive and negative likelihood ratios of 4.5 and 0.8. there was little evidence of variation in specificity by gender, number of hiv symptoms, or result of a dementia screen.   limitations the low prevalence of mdd yielded very imprecise sensitivity estimates. although the phq-9 was developed as a self-administered tool, we assessed an interviewer-administered version due to the literacy level of the target population.   conclusion the phq-9 demonstrated high specificity but apparently low sensitivity for detecting mdd in this sample of hiv patients in cameroon. formative work to define the performance of proven screening tools in new settings remains important as research on mental health expands in low-income countries.
automatic effort mobilization and the principle of resource conservation: one can only prime the possible and justified. according to the auto-motive model (j. a. bargh, 1990), intentions and goals are represented mentally and, as representations, should be capable of nonconscious activation by the environmental context (i.e., "priming"). to test this hypothesis, the authors replicated 2 well-known experiments that had demonstrated differential effects of varying the information-processing goal (impression formation or memorization) on processing the identical behavioral information. however, instead of giving participants the goals via explicit instructions, as had been done in the original studies, the authors primed the impression formation or memorization goal. in both cases, the original pattern of results was reproduced. the findings thus support the hypothesis that the effect of activated goals is the same whether the activation is nonconscious or through an act of will.
faster and stronger manifestation of mitochondrial diseases in skeletal muscle than in heart related to cytosolic inorganic phosphate (pi) accumulation. it is shown, using the computer model of glycolysis in skeletal muscle developed recently by lambeth and kushmerick (ann. biomed. bioenerg, 30 (2001) 19-34) incorporated into the computer model of oxidative phosphorylation developed by korzeniewski et al. (biophys. chem. 83 (2001) 19-34) that the regulation of glycolysis by adp, amp and p(i) is decidedly insufficient to explain the large increase in the glycolytic flux during transition from rest to intensive exercise in intact skeletal muscle. computer simulations based on a simple kinetic description of the glycolytic atp and h(+) production strongly suggests that glycolysis must be directly activated during muscle contraction. they also demonstrate that the inhibition of glycolysis by h(+) is needed to explain the transient activation of this pathway at the onset of exercise as well as the duration time and extent of the initial alkalization after the onset of exercise. finally, it is shown that atp supply from anaerobic glycolysis slows down the vo(2) kinetics during rest-to-work transition.
quantitative and functional interrogation of parent-of-origin allelic expression biases in the brain we present a novel pipeline and methodology for simultaneously estimating isoform expression and allelic imbalance in diploid organisms using rna-seq data. we achieve this by modeling the expression of haplotype-specific isoforms. if unknown, the two parental isoform sequences can be individually reconstructed. a new statistical method, mmseq, deconvolves the mapping of reads to multiple transcripts (isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms). our software can take into account non-uniform read generation and works with paired-end reads.
design and quantification of an extreme winter storm scenario for emergency preparedness and planning exercises in california abstract the availability of long-term gridded datasets of precipitation, temperature, and other surface meteorological variables offers the potential for deriving a range of land surface conditions that have not been directly observed. these include, for instance, soil moisture, snow water equivalent, evapotranspiration, runoff, and subsurface moisture transport. however, gridding procedures can themselves introduce artificial trends due to incorporation of stations with different record lengths and locations. hence, existing gridded datasets are in general not appropriate for estimation of long-term trends. methods are described here for adjustment of gridded daily precipitation and temperature maxima and minima over the continental united states based on newly available (in electronic form) u.s. cooperative observer station data archived at the national climatic data center from the early 1900s on. the intent is to produce gridded meteorological datasets that can be used, in conjunction with hydrologic...
β2-agonists promote host defense against bacterial infection in primary human bronchial epithelial cells background short palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone 1 (splunc1) protein is an airway epithelial cell–derived molecule exerting host defense against pathogen. however, the function and regulation of splunc1 in nasal epithelial cells are still unclear. chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (crswnps) is a disorder characterized by eosinophilic th2 inflammation and frequent microbial colonization. the pathogenesis has been postulated as a disturbed mucosal immune response. this study investigates the splunc1 expression of nasal polyp epithelial cells in air–liquid interface (ali) culture and after treating with th2 inflammatory cytokines il-13. methods human nasal polyp epithelial cells isolated from patients with crswnps were put in different cell culture models at days 0 and 21 and were assessed for expression of splunc1 by microarray. cultured cells in ali plus retinoic acid (ali + ra) model were then incubated with 0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml human recombinant il-13 for up to 5 days. the expression of splunc1 was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-q-pcr), reverse-transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) and western blot analysis. results ali + ra culture model harvesting ciliary differentiated nasal epithelial cells constitutively expressed high levels of splunc1. in contrast, splunc1 is reduced under classic submerged single layer culture. splunc1 is also dose-responsively down-regulated after incubation with il-13. conclusions a microenvironmental milieu containing il-13 may be detrimental to the host innate immunity response, at least in part, through the inhibition of splunc1 production.
modeling information diffusion dynamics over social networks tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the web has been an issue of considerable interest. recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. however, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events.  we develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. as our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. we tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. in particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. we also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.
effects of spatial cueing on representational momentum. some accounts hold that the position of moving objects is extrapolated either in visual perception or visual short-term memory ("representational momentum"). however, some studies did not find forward displacement of the final position when smooth motion was used, whereas reliable displacement was observed with implied motion. to resolve this conflict, the frequency of position changes was varied to sample motion types between the extreme cases of implied and smooth motion. a continuous function relating frequency of target change and displacement was found: displacement increased when the frequency of position changes was reduced. further, the response mode was varied. probe judgments produced less forward displacement than motor judgments such as mouse or natural pointing movements. also, localization judgments were susceptible to motion context, but not to variations of probe shape or expectancy about trajectory length. it is suggested that forward displacement results from the extrapolation of the next step in the observed motion sequence.
a design framework for awareness cues in distributed multiplayer games a large-scale content analysis of characters in video games was employed to answer questions about their representations of gender, race and age in comparison to the us population. the sample included 150 games from a year across nine platforms, with the results weighted according to game sales. this innovation enabled the results to be analyzed in proportion to the games that were actually played by the public, and thus allowed the first statements able to be generalized about the content of popular video games. the results show a systematic over-representation of males, white and adults and a systematic under-representation of females, hispanics, native americans, children and the elderly. overall, the results are similar to those found in television research. the implications for identity, cognitive models, cultivation and game research are discussed.
longitudinal study of cognitive and psychiatric functions in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1 and 2 objective: to develop a reliable and valid clinical scale measuring the severity of ataxia. methods: the authors devised the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (sara) and tested it in two trials of 167 and 119 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia. results: the mean time to administer sara in patients was 14.2 ± 7.5 minutes (range 5 to 40). interrater reliability was high, with an intraclass coefficient (icc) of 0.98. test-retest reliability was high with an icc of 0.90. internal consistency was high as indicated by cronbach's α of 0.94. factorial analysis revealed that the rating results were determined by a single factor. sara ratings showed a linear relation to global assessments using a visual analogue scale, suggesting linearity of the scale (p < 0.0001, r2 = 0.98). sara score increased with the disease stage (p < 0.001) and was closely correlated with the barthel index (r = −0.80, p < 0.001) and part iv (functional assessment) of the unified huntington's disease rating scale (uhdrs-iv) (r = −0.89, p < 0.0001), whereas it had only a weak correlation with disease duration (r = 0.34, p < 0.0002) conclusions: the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia is a reliable and valid measure of ataxia, making it an appropriate primary outcome measure for clinical trials.
low wall velocity of left atrial appendage measured by trans-thoracic echocardiography predicts thrombus formation caused by atrial appendage dysfunction. context patients who have atrial fibrillation (af) have an increased risk of stroke, but their absolute rate of stroke depends on age and comorbid conditions.   objective to assess the predictive value of classification schemes that estimate stroke risk in patients with af.   design, setting, and patients two existing classification schemes were combined into a new stroke-risk scheme, the chads( 2) index, and all 3 classification schemes were validated. the chads( 2) was formed by assigning 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, and diabetes mellitus and by assigning 2 points for history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. data from peer review organizations representing 7 states were used to assemble a national registry of af (nraf) consisting of 1733 medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 95 years who had nonrheumatic af and were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge.   main outcome measure hospitalization for ischemic stroke, determined by medicare claims data.   results during 2121 patient-years of follow-up, 94 patients were readmitted to the hospital for ischemic stroke (stroke rate, 4.4 per 100 patient-years). as indicated by a c statistic greater than 0.5, the 2 existing classification schemes predicted stroke better than chance: c of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.65-0.71) for the scheme developed by the atrial fibrillation investigators (afi) and c of 0.74 (95% ci, 0.71-0.76) for the stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (spaf) iii scheme. however, with a c statistic of 0.82 (95% ci, 0.80-0.84), the chads( 2) index was the most accurate predictor of stroke. the stroke rate per 100 patient-years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 (95% ci, 1.3-1.7) for each 1-point increase in the chads( 2) score: 1.9 (95% ci, 1.2-3.0) for a score of 0; 2.8 (95% ci, 2.0-3.8) for 1; 4.0 (95% ci, 3.1-5.1) for 2; 5.9 (95% ci, 4.6-7.3) for 3; 8.5 (95% ci, 6.3-11.1) for 4; 12.5 (95% ci, 8.2-17.5) for 5; and 18.2 (95% ci, 10.5-27.4) for 6.   conclusion the 2 existing classification schemes and especially a new stroke risk index, chads( 2), can quantify risk of stroke for patients who have af and may aid in selection of antithrombotic therapy.
shifts in intended and unintended pregnancies in the united states, 2001-2008. background the incidence of unintended pregnancy is among the most essential health status indicators in the field of reproductive health. one ongoing goal of the us department of health and human services is to reduce unintended pregnancy, but the national rate has not been estimated since 2001.   study design we combined data on women's pregnancy intentions from the 2006-2008 and 2002 national survey of family growth with a 2008 national survey of abortion patients and data on births from the national center for health statistics, induced abortions from a national abortion provider census, miscarriages estimated from the national survey of family growth and population data from the us census bureau.   results nearly half (49%) of pregnancies were unintended in 2006, up slightly from 2001 (48%). the unintended pregnancy rate increased to 52 per 1000 women aged 15-44 years in 2006 from 50 in 2001. disparities in unintended pregnancy rates among subgroups persisted and in some cases increased, and women who were 18-24 years old, poor or cohabiting had rates two to three times the national rate. the unintended pregnancy rate declined notably for teens 15-17 years old. the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion decreased from 47% in 2001 to 43% in 2006, and the unintended birth rate increased from 23 to 25 per 1000 women 15-44 years old.   conclusions since 2001, the united states has not made progress in reducing unintended pregnancy. rates increased for nearly all groups and remain high overall. efforts to help women and couples plan their pregnancies, such as increasing access to effective contraceptives, should focus on groups at greatest risk for unintended pregnancy, particularly poor and cohabiting women.
the amara corpus: building resources for translating the web's educational content we propose a new phrase-based translation model and decoding algorithm that enables us to evaluate and compare several, previously proposed phrase-based translation models. within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based models. our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems.
a putative transcription factor myt1 is required for female fertility in the ascomycete gibberella zeae a galpha subunit-encoding gene (cga1) was cloned from cochliobolus heterostrophus, a heterothallic foliar pathogen of corn. the deduced amino acid sequence showed similarity to galpha proteins from other filamentous fungi and suggested that cga1 is a member of the galphai class. cga1 mutants had reduced ability to form appressoria on glass surfaces and on corn leaves; mutants nevertheless caused lesions on corn plants like those of wild type. cga1 mutants were female sterile; sexual development was completely abolished when the mutant allele was homozygous in a cross. ascospores produced in crosses heterozygous at cga1 were all wild type. the signal transduction pathway represented by cga1 appears to be involved in developmental pathways leading to either appressorium formation or mating; in sexual development cga1 is required for both fertility and ascospore viability.
the secret life of the anthrax agent bacillus anthracis: bacteriophage-mediated ecological adaptations phage-mediated lysis has been an essential laboratory tool for rapidly identifying bacillus anthracis for more than 40 years, relying on the gamma phage derivative of a bacillus cereus prophage called w. the complete genomic sequences of the temperate w phage, referred to as wbeta, and its lytic variant gamma were determined and found to encode 53 open reading frames each, spanning 40,864 bp and 37,373 bp, respectively. direct comparison of the genomes showed that gamma evolved through mutations at key loci controlling host recognition, lysogenic growth, and possibly host phenotypic modification. included are a cluster of point mutations at the gp14 tail fiber locus of gamma, encoding a protein that, when fused to green fluorescent protein, binds specifically to b. anthracis. a large 2,003-bp deletion was also identified at the gamma lysogeny module, explaining its shift from a temperate to a lytic lifestyle. finally, evidence of recombination was observed at a dicistronic wbeta locus, encoding putative bacterial cell surface-modifying proteins, replaced in gamma with a locus, likely obtained from a b. anthracis prophage, encoding demonstrable fosfomycin resistance. reverse transcriptase pcr analysis confirmed strong induction at the dicistronic wbeta locus and at four other phage loci in b. anthracis and/or b. cereus lysogens. in all, this study represents the first genomic and functional description of two historically important phages and is part of a broader investigation into contributions of phage to the b. anthracis life cycle. initial findings suggest that lysogeny of b. anthracis promotes ecological adaptation, rather than virulence, as with other gram-positive pathogens.
excitatory or inhibitory: a new semantic orientation extracts contradiction and causality from the web a vast amount of information and knowledge has been accumulated and circulated on the web. they provide people with options regarding their daily lives and are starting to have a strong influence on governmental policies and business management. a crucial problem is that information on the web is not necessarily credible. this paper describes an information analysis system called wisdom, which assists users in assessing the credibility of information on the web. wisdom is to organize information on a given topic through the following three types of analyses: (1) extracting and contrasting opinions and important statements around the points related to the topic, (2) identifying and classifying the information sender of each page; and (3) analyzing the appearance of each page, for example, page design and writing style. our preliminary evaluation indicates the effectiveness of wisdom and its advantage to google from the viewpoint of the ability of grasping the difference of information senders and opinions.
differentially private maximal frequent sequence mining sequential data is being increasingly used in a variety of applications. publishing sequential data is of vital importance to the advancement of these applications. however, as shown by the re-identification attacks on the aol and netflix datasets, releasing sequential data may pose considerable threats to individual privacy. recent research has indicated the failure of existing sanitization techniques to provide claimed privacy guarantees. it is therefore urgent to respond to this failure by developing new schemes with provable privacy guarantees. differential privacy is one of the only models that can be used to provide such guarantees. due to the inherent sequentiality and high-dimensionality, it is challenging to apply differential privacy to sequential data. in this paper, we address this challenge by employing a variable-length n-gram model, which extracts the essential information of a sequential database in terms of a set of variable-length n-grams. our approach makes use of a carefully designed exploration tree structure and a set of novel techniques based on the markov assumption in order to lower the magnitude of added noise. the published n-grams are useful for many purposes. furthermore, we develop a solution for generating a synthetic database, which enables a wider spectrum of data analysis tasks. extensive experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
modality-independent role of the primary auditory cortex in time estimation attention modulates our subjective perception of time. the less we attend to an event's duration, the shorter it seems to last. attention to time or color stimulus attributes was modulated parametrically in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. linear increases in task performance were accompanied by corresponding increases in brain activity. increasing attention to time selectively increased activity in a corticostriatal network, including pre–supplementary motor area and right frontal operculum. increasing attention to color selectively increased activity in area v4. by identifying areas whose activity was specifically modulated by attention to time, we have defined the core neuroanatomical substrates of timing behavior.
n-meander scanning trace a method for the on-chip bandwidth reduction this work presents a domain-specific memory subsystem based on a two-level memory hierarchy. it targets the application domain of video post-processing applications including video enhancement and format conversion. these applications are based on motion compensation and/or broad class of content adaptive filtering to provide the highest quality of pictures. our approach meets the required performance and has sufficient flexibility for the application domain. it especially aims at the implementation-wise most challenging applications: compute-intensive and bandwidth-demanding applications that provide the highest quality at high picture resolutions. the lowest level of the memory hierarchy, closest to the processing element, the l0 scratchpad, is organized specifically to enable fast retrieval of an arbitrarily positioned 2-d block of pixels to the processing element. to guarantee the performance, most of its addressing logic is hardwired, leaving a user a set of api for initialization and storing/loading the data to/from the l0 scratchpad. the next level of the memory hierarchy, the l1 scratchpad, minimizes the off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. the l1 scratchpad is organized specifically to enable efficient aligned block-based accesses. with lower data rates compared to the l0 scratchpad and aligned block access, software-based addressing is used to enable full flexibility. the two-level memory hierarchy exploits prefetching to further improve the performance.
owl-enabled assembly planning for robotic agents robotics track in this paper, we introduce a novel robot programming paradigm. it focuses on reducing the required expertise in robotics to a level that allows shop floor workers to use robots in their application domain without the need of extensive training. our approach is user-centric and can interpret underspecified robot tasks, enabling communication on an abstract level. such high-level task descriptions make the system amenable for users that are experts in a particular domain, but have limited knowledge about robotics and are thus not able to specify low-level details and instructions. semantic models for all involved entities, i.e., processes, workpieces, and workcells, enable automatic reasoning about underspecified tasks and missing pieces of information. we showcase and evaluate this methodology on two industrial use cases from the domains of assembly and woodworking, comparing it to state-of-the-art solutions provided by robot manufacturers.
predict and constrain: modeling cardinality in deep structured prediction we approach structured output prediction by optimizing a deep value network (dvn) to precisely estimate the task loss on different output configurations for a given input. once the model is trained, we perform inference by gradient descent on the continuous relaxations of the output variables to find outputs with promising scores from the value network. when applied to image segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar estimating the intersection over union between the input and ground truth masks. for multi-label classification, the dvn's objective is to correctly predict the f1 score for any potential label configuration. the dvn framework achieves the state-of-the-art results on multi-label prediction and image segmentation benchmarks.

mapping ontologies using sat solvers this is a landmark book. for anyone interested in language, in dictionaries and thesauri, or natural language processing, the introduction, chapters 14, and chapter 16 are must reading. (select other chapters according to your special interests; see the chapter-by-chapter review). these chapters provide a thorough introduction to the preeminent electronic lexical database of today in terms of accessibility and usage in a wide range of applications. but what does that have to do with digital libraries? natural language processing is essential for dealing efficiently with the large quantities of text now available online: fact extraction and summarization, automated indexing and text categorization, and machine translation. another essential function is helping the user with query formulation through synonym relationships between words and hierarchical and other relationships between concepts. wordnet supports both of these functions and thus deserves careful study by the digital library community.
reading scene text with attention convolutional sequence modeling we introduce adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. the method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. the method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. the hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. some connections to related algorithms, on which adam was inspired, are discussed. we also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. empirical results demonstrate that adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. finally, we discuss adamax, a variant of adam based on the infinity norm.
genome wide association identifies novel loci involved in fungal communication the late golgi of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae receives membrane traffic from the secretory pathway as well as retrograde traffic from post-golgi compartments, but the machinery that regulates these vesicle-docking and fusion events has not been characterized. we have identified three components of a novel protein complex that is required for protein sorting at the yeast late golgi compartment. mutation of vps52, vps53, or vps54 results in the missorting of 70% of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase y as well as the mislocalization of late golgi membrane proteins to the vacuole, whereas protein traffic through the early part of the golgi complex is unaffected. a vps52/53/54 triple mutant strain is phenotypically indistinguishable from each of the single mutants, consistent with the model that all three are required for a common step in membrane transport. native coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that vps52p, vps53p, and vps54p are associated in a 1:1:1 complex that sediments as a single peak on sucrose velocity gradients. this complex, which exists both in a soluble pool and as a peripheral component of a membrane fraction, colocalizes with markers of the yeast late golgi by immunofluorescence microscopy. together, the phenotypic and biochemical data suggest that vps52, vps53, and vps54 are required for the retrograde transport of golgi membrane proteins from an endosomal/prevacuolar compartment. the vps52/53/54 complex joins a growing list of distinct multisubunit complexes that regulate membrane-trafficking events.
star-topology decoupling in spin the success of model checking is largely based on its ability to efficiently locate errors in software designs. if an error is found, a model checker produces a trail that shows how the error state can be reached, which greatly facilitates debugging. however, while current model checkers find error states efficiently, the counterexamples are often unnecessarily lengthy, which hampers error explanation. this is due to the use of “naive” search algorithms in the state space exploration.in this paper we present approaches to the use of heuristic search algorithms in explicit-state model checking. we present the class of a* directed search algorithms and propose heuristics together with bitstate compression techniques for the search of safety property violations. we achieve great reductions in the length of the error trails, and in some instances render problems analyzable by exploring a much smaller number of states than standard depth-first search. we then suggest an improvement of the nested depth-first search algorithm and show how it can be used together with a* to improve the search for liveness property violations. our approach to directed explicit-state model checking has been implemented in a tool set called hsf-spin. we provide experimental results from the protocol validation domain using hsf-spin.
effect of breastfeeding promotion interventions on cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immunization in indonesia researchers attempted to increase the initiation of breastfeeding and its duration to 6 months among a group of low-income, hispanic women through an intervention program which included prenatal education and home based postpartum support. all participants were telephoned after delivery to determine infant feeding method. duration of breastfeeding was determined by counting the number of days from initiation to the last day the baby was put to the breast. the bayesian approach was used for the statistical analyses. in the intervention group, the propensity to initiate breastfeeding exceeded that of the control group. results indicate the intervention group had twice (2.31) the odds of starting breastfeeding, twice (1.84-3.15) the odds of continuing to breastfeed for 6 months, and only half (.50-.54) the tendency to quit at any one time than did the control group.
face recognition using weber local descriptors information jointly contained in image space, scale and orientation domains can provide rich important clues not seen in either individual of these domains. the position, spatial frequency and orientation selectivity properties are believed to have an important role in visual perception. this paper proposes a novel face representation and recognition approach by exploring information jointly in image space, scale and orientation domains. specifically, the face image is first decomposed into different scale and orientation responses by convolving multiscale and multi-orientation gabor filters. second, local binary pattern analysis is used to describe the neighboring relationship not only in image space, but also in different scale and orientation responses. this way, information from different domains is explored to give a good face representation for recognition. discriminant classification is then performed based upon weighted histogram intersection or conditional mutual information with linear discriminant analysis techniques. extensive experimental results on feret, ar, and frgc ver 2.0 databases show the significant advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones.
differences in helicobacter pylori caga tyrosine phosphorylation motif patterns between western and east asian strains, and influences on interleukin-8 secretion. helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer. caga+h. pylori strains are more virulent than caga− strains and are associated with gastric carcinoma. the caga gene product, caga, is injected by the bacterium into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. the phosphorylated caga specifically binds shp-2 phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, and thereby induces morphological transformation of cells. caga proteins of most western h. pylori isolates have a 34-amino acid sequence that variably repeats among different strains. here, we show that the repeat sequence contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site. caga proteins having more repeats were found to undergo greater tyrosine phosphorylation, to exhibit increased shp-2 binding, and to induce greater morphological changes. in contrast, predominant caga proteins specified by h. pylori strains isolated in east asia, where gastric carcinoma is prevalent, had a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sequence at the region corresponding to the repeat sequence of western caga. this east asian-specific sequence conferred stronger shp-2 binding and morphologically transforming activities to western caga. finally, a critical amino acid residue that determines shp-2 binding activity among different caga proteins was identified. our results indicate that the potential of individual caga to perturb host-cell functions is determined by the degree of shp-2 binding activity, which depends in turn on the number and sequences of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. the presence of distinctly structured caga proteins in western and east asian h. pylori isolates may underlie the strikingly different incidences of gastric carcinoma in these two geographic areas.
cerebrospinal fluid biomarker candidates for parkinsonian disorders background nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) reduce dopaminergic neuron degeneration in animal models of parkinson disease (pd). however, no epidemiological data have been available on nsaid use and the risk of pd.   objective to investigate prospectively whether the use of nonaspirin nsaids or aspirin is associated with decreased pd risk.   design, settings, and participants prospective cohorts of 44 057 men and 98 845 women free of pd, stroke, or cancer (health professionals follow-up study, 1986-2000, and nurses' health study, 1980-1998). main outcome measure newly diagnosed pd.   results we documented 415 incident pd cases (236 men and 179 women). participants who reported regular use of nonaspirin nsaids at the beginning of the study had a lower risk of pd than nonregular users during the follow-up; the pooled multivariate relative risk was 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.96, p =.04). compared with nonusers, a nonsignificantly lower risk of pd was also observed among men and women who took 2 or more tablets of aspirin per day (relative risk, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.21).   conclusion these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that use of nsaids may delay or prevent the onset of pd.
an analysis method for the improvement of reliability and performance in policy-based management systems modern distributed systems contain a large number of objects and must be capable of evolving, without shutting down the complete system, to cater for changing requirements. there is a need for distributed, automated management agents whose behavior also has to dynamically change to reflect the evolution of the system being managed. policies are a means of specifying and influencing management behavior within a distributed system, without coding the behavior into the manager agents. our approach is aimed at specifying implementable policies, although policies may be initially specified at the organizational level and then refined to implementable actions. we are concerned with two types of policies. authorization policies specify what activities a manager is permitted or forbidden to do to a set of target objects and are similar to security access-control policies. obligation policies specify what activities a manager must or must not do to a set of target objects and essentially define the duties of a manager. conflicts can arise in the set of policies. conflicts may also arise during the refinement process between the high level goals and the implementable policies. the system may have to cater for conflicts such as exceptions to normal authorization policies. the paper reviews policy conflicts, focusing on the problems of conflict detection and resolution. we discuss the various precedence relationships that can be established between policies in order to allow inconsistent policies to coexist within the system and present a conflict analysis tool which forms part of a role based management framework. software development and medical environments are used as example scenarios.
spatial optimization of carbon-stocking projects across africa integrating stocking potential with co-benefits and feasibility. tropical forest ecosystems play an important role in regulating the global climate, yet deforestation and land-use change mean that the tropical carbon sink is increasingly influenced by agroecosystems and pastures. despite this, it is not yet fully understood how carbon cycling in the tropics responds to land-use change, particularly for pasture and afforestation. thus, the objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate the environmental controls and the impact of management on gross primary production (gpp), total ecosystem respiration (ter) and net ecosystem co2 exchange (nee); (2) to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation; and (3) to compare eddy covariance-derived carbon budgets with biomass and soil inventory data. we performed comparative measurements of nee in a tropical c4 pasture and an adjacent afforestation with native tree species in sardinilla (panama) from 2007 to 2009. pronounced seasonal variation in gpp, ter and nee were closely related to radiation, soil moisture, and c3 vs. c4 plant physiology. the shallow rooting depth of grasses compared with trees resulted in a higher sensitivity of the pasture ecosystem to water limitation and seasonal drought. during 2008, substantial amounts of carbon were sequestered by the afforestation (–442 g c m, negative values denote ecosystem carbon uptake), which was in agreement with biometric observations (–450 g c m). in contrast, the pasture ecosystem was a strong carbon source in 2008 and 2009 (261 g c m), associated with seasonal drought and overgrazing. in addition, soil carbon isotope data indicated rapid carbon turnover after conversion from c4 pasture to c3 afforestation. our results clearly show the potential for considerable carbon sequestration of tropical afforestation and highlight the risk of carbon losses from pasture ecosystems in a seasonal tropical climate.

measurement of gluconeogenesis using glucose fragments/mass spectrometry following ingestion of deuterium oxide healthy subjects ingested 2h2o and after 14, 22, and 42 h of fasting the enrichments of deuterium in the hydrogens bound to carbons 2, 5, and 6 of blood glucose and in body water were determined. the hydrogens bound to the carbons were isolated in formaldehyde which was converted to hexamethylenetetramine for assay. enrichment of the deuterium bound to carbon 5 of glucose to that in water or to carbon 2 directly equals the fraction of glucose formed by gluconeogenesis. the contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production was 47 +/- 49% after 14 h, 67 +/- 41% after 22 h, and 93 +/- 2% after 42 h of fasting. glycerol's conversion to glucose is included in estimates using the enrichment at carbon 5, but not carbon 6. equilibrations with water of the hydrogens bound to carbon 3 of pyruvate that become those bound to carbon 6 of glucose and of the hydrogen at carbon 2 of glucose produced via glycogenolysis are estimated from the enrichments to be approximately 80% complete. thus, rates of gluconeogenesis can be determined without corrections required in other tracer methodologies. after an overnight fast gluconeogenesis accounts for approximately 50% and after 42 h of fasting for almost all of glucose production in healthy subjects.
genomic structure, transcriptional control, and tissue distribution of herg1 and kcnq1 genes. the long qt syndrome gene human ether-a-go-go related gene (herg) encodes a k(+) channel critical to cardiac repolarization. it peculiarly overexpresses in cancer cells of different histogenesis and promotes tumorigenesis. to decipher the molecular mechanisms for herg overexpression, we identified and characterized the promoter region of the herg gene, which contains cis-elements for multiple oncoproteins and tumor suppressors. oncoprotein sp1 was found to be essential to driving the herg promoter thereby transcription. another oncoprotein nf-kappab transactivated, while tumor suppressor nkx3.1 repressed herg promoter activity and endogenous herg transcription. loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding cis-elements rendered a loss of the ability of the oncoproteins sp1 and nf-kappab to transactivate, and of the tumor repressor nkx3.1 to repress, herg transcription. either activation of sp1 and nf-kappab or silencing of nkx3.1 promoted tumor cell growth, and the effects were abrogated by herg inhibition or knockdown, but facilitated by overexpression of herg, indicating that herg mediates the cell growth signals generated by activation of oncoproteins or inactivation of tumor suppressors. binding of sp1, nf-kappab, and nkx3.1 to their respective cis-elements in the herg promoter in vitro and their presence on the herg promoter in vivo were confirmed. therefore, the herg promoter region is characterized by multiple sp1 binding sites that are responsible for transcription initiation of the herg gene and by binding sites for multiple other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes being important for regulating herg expression. the herg k(+) channel is likely a mediator of growth-promoting processes induced by oncoproteins and/or by silencing of tumor suppressors.
transcriptional dynamics of a conserved gene expression network associated with craniofacial divergence in arctic charr the transfac database on eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, comprising data on transcription factors, their target genes and regulatory binding sites, has been extended and further developed, both in number of entries and in the scope and structure of the collected data. structured fields for expression patterns have been introduced for transcription factors from human and mouse, using the cytomer database on anatomical structures and developmental stages. the functionality of match, a tool for matrix-based search of transcription factor binding sites, has been enhanced. for instance, the program now comes along with a number of tissue-(or state-)specific profiles and new profiles can be created and modified with match profiler. the gene table was extended and gained in importance, containing amongst others links to locuslink, refseq and omim now. further, (direct) links between factor and target gene on one hand and between gene and encoded factor on the other hand were introduced. the transfac public release is available at http://www.gene-regulation.com. for yeast an additional release including the latest data was made available separately as transfac saccharomyces module (tsm) at http://transfac.gbf.de. for cytomer free download versions are available at http://www.biobase.de:8080/index.html.
temporal trends in treatment outcomes for hiv-1 and hiv-2-infected adults enrolled in côte d'ivoire's national antiretroviral therapy program standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. if several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. this tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. examples of analysis with standard software are shown.
resting state network estimation in individual subjects consciousness is reduced during nonrapid eye movement (nrem) sleep due to changes in brain function that are still poorly understood. here, we tested the hypothesis that impaired consciousness during nrem sleep is associated with an increased modularity of brain activity. cerebral connectivity was quantified in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging times series acquired in 13 healthy volunteers during wakefulness and nrem sleep. the analysis revealed a modification of the hierarchical organization of large-scale networks into smaller independent modules during nrem sleep, independently from eeg markers of the slow oscillation. such modifications in brain connectivity, possibly driven by sleep ultraslow oscillations, could hinder the brain's ability to integrate information and account for decreased consciousness during nrem sleep.
the abc adaptive fusion architecture many distributed programming environments have been designed to support distributed shared objects over the internet. most of these environments (java rmi and corba, for example), support client-server applications where distributed objects reside on servers, which execute all methods (remote or local) invoked on the objects. traditional client-server models do not support client-side object caching and the local access it provides. we believe that object caching is critical to distributed applications, especially over the internet, where latency and bandwidth are highly variable. we have developed a configurable and efficient remote method invocation mechanism that provides the same interface as java rmi, while extending its functionality so that shared objects can be cached on the accessing nodes. the mechanism, called javanaise, is based on the caching of clusters, which are groups of interdependent java objects. we have implemented a prototype consisting of a preprocessor that generates the required proxy classes from the application interfaces and a run-time environment that uses system classes to manage the consistency of cluster replicas cached on client nodes. we describe the motivation for the work, the design choices made for the javanaise clustering mechanism, the implementation principles for managing javanaise clusters, and the results from three experiments that compare the performance of javanaise with java rmi.
heat shock protein 90 stimulates rat mesenchymal stem cell migration via pi3k/akt and erk1/2 pathways abstractaim:to explore whether bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (msc) can differentiate into myocardial-like cells induced by myocardial medium, especially the hypoxia/reoxygenation-conditioned medium of cardiomyocytes.methods:myocardial cells obtained from neonatal sprague-dawley rat ventricles were isolated and cultured in vitro and a hypoxia reoxygenation model was established. the msc isolated from adult sprague-dawley rats were purified and then incubated with 3 different mediums: medium a - the conditioned medium of normal cardiomyocytes; medium b - the conditioned medium of cardiomyocytes after hypoxia reoxygenation; and the control medium - ordinary medium. the expressions of the cardiac myosin heavy chain (mhc), troponin t (tnt) and connexin 43 were investigated in the msc after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h cultivation, respectively.results:the msc expressed mhc and tnt when incubated with the conditioned medium of cardiomyocytes after hypoxia reoxygenation, but did not express connexin 43. none of mhc, tnt and connexin 43 was detected in the msc incubated with the conditioned medium of normal cardiomyocytes.conclusion:the results indicate for the first time that myocardial medium for hypoxic preconditioning can induce msc differentiation into myocardial-like cells.
measuring quality of life in low-income, spanish-speaking puerto ricans with type 2 diabetes residing in the mainland u.s. administrative databases are increasingly used for studying outcomes of medical care. valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. we adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on international classification of diseases (icd-9-cm) diagnosis and procedure codes. the association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). the index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. these associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. they also persisted after controlling for patient age. we conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.
number of days required to estimate habitual activity using wrist-worn geneactiv accelerometer: a cross-sectional study purpose to examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (n = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.   methods physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the computer science applications (csa) accelerometer. day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated.   results physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. for activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring.   conclusion these findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.
a framework for recognizing the simultaneous aspects of american sign language in this paper we present a novel approach to continuous, whole-sentence asl recognition that uses phonemes instead of whole signs as the basic units. our approach is based on a sequential phonological model of asl. according to this model the asl signs can be broken into movements and holds, which are both considered phonemes.this model does away with the distinction between whole signs and epenthesis movements that we made in previous work [17]. instead, epenthesis movements are just like the other movements that constitute the signs.we subsequently train hidden markov models (hmms) to recognize the phonemes, instead of whole signs and epenthesis movements that we recognized previously [17]. because the number of phonemes is limited, hmm-based training and recognition of the asl signal becomes computationally more tractable and has the potential to lead to the recognition of large-scale vocabularies.we experimented with a 22 word vocabulary, and we achieved similar recognition rates with phoneme-and word-based approaches. this result is very promising for scaling the task in the future.
entity type modeling for multi-document summarization : generating descriptive summaries of geo-located entities being expensive and time consuming, human knowledge acquisition has consistently been a major bottleneck for solving real problems. in this paper, we present a practical framework for acquiring high quality non-expert knowledge from on-demand workforce using amazon mechanical turk (mturk). we show how to apply this framework to collect large-scale human knowledge on aol query classification in a fast and efficient fashion. based on extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate how to detect low-quality labels from massive data sets and their impact on collecting high-quality knowledge. our experimental findings also provide insight into the best practices on balancing cost and data quality for using mturk.
internal threshold of toxicological concern values: enabling route-to-route extrapolation this study presents a mechanistic qsar analysis of human intestinal absorption of drugs and drug-like compounds using a data set of 567 %hia values. experimental data represent passive diffusion across intestinal membranes, and are considered to be reasonably free of carrier-mediated transport or other unwanted effects. a nonlinear model was developed relating %hia to physicochemical properties of drugs (lipophilicity, ionization, hydrogen bonding, and molecular size). the model describes ion-specific intestinal permeability of drugs by both transcellular and paracellular routes, and also accounts for unstirred water layer effects. the obtained model was validated on two external data sets consisting of in vivo human jejunal permeability coefficients (p(eff)) and absorption rate constants (k(a)). validation results demonstrate good predictive power of the model (rmse = 0.35-0.45 log units for log k(a) and log p(eff)). high prediction accuracy together with clear physicochemical interpretation (log p, pk(a)) makes this model particularly suitable for use in property-based drug design.
a comparison of health-related quality of life between children with versus without special health care needs, and children requiring versus not requiring psychiatric services * abbreviations:  mch = : maternal and child health (program) • cshcn = : children with special health care needs (program) • dscshcn = : (maternal and child health bureau's) division of services for children with special health care needs.  developing community systems of services for children with special health care needs represents a significant challenge for pediatricians, families, managed care organizations, and public and private agencies providing services to this population. at the state level, maternal and child health (mch) and children with special health care needs (cshcn) programs are vested with the responsibility for planning and developing systems of care for all children with special health care needs. historically, these programs have been supported through title v of the social security act, with state-matching funds, to provide health services to selected groups of children with special needs, typically those with complex physical conditions. however, during the last half-century, service systems have become increasingly complex as a result of health, education, and social policy changes, as well as changes in the epidemiology of child health, including increases in the number and proportion of children with chronic conditions and disabilities and changes in their case-mix.1-4 these changes have resulted in gaps in some service areas and duplication in other areas, as well as fragmentation in the way service systems are organized.5   recognizing these difficulties, health policy leaders at the state and federal levels, with broad input from public and private agencies, providers, and families, effected legislative changes in the federal omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989, which expanded the mission of cshcn programs to facilitate the development of community-based systems of services for children with special health care needs and their families. since then, the explosive growth of managed care has presented new challenges and opportunities as well as a heightened urgency for the development of systems of care that integrate health and related services for this population.6 7   developing systems to serve children with special health care needs requires a clear definition of the population to …   address correspondence and reprint requests to: merle mcpherson, md, maternal and child health bureau, room 18a27, parklawn bldg, 5600 fishers ln, rockville, md 20857.
the influence of inspiratory muscle work history and specific inspiratory muscle training upon human limb muscle fatigue the aim of the study was to examine if the twitch interpolation technique could be used to objectively measure fatigue in the quadriceps muscle in subjects performing submaximally. the 'true' maximum isometric quadriceps torque was determined in 21 healthy subject using the twitch interpolation technique. then an endurance test was performed in which the subjects made repeated isometric contractions at 50% of the 'true' maximum torque for 4 s, separated by 6 s rest periods. during the test, the force response to single electrical stimulation (twitch amplitude) was measured at 50% and 25% of the estimated maximum torque. in 10 subjects, the test was repeated 2-4 weeks later. twitch amplitudes at 50% of maximum torque declined exponentially with time in 20 of 21 subjects. the distribution of the exponential rate constant was skewed with a mean of 4.6 h-1 and range of 0.3-21.5 h-1. after logarithmical transformation, the distribution of the exponential rate constant fitted closely to a normal distribution, and the inter-individual variation was sd = 1.15 compared to an intra-individual variation of 0.29. the coefficient of correlation for repeated determination was 0.91 (p < 0.001, n = 10). in conclusion, the twitch technique can be used for objectively measuring fatigue of the quadriceps muscle.
oxidative stress and its role in female infertility and assisted reproduction: clinical implications background the impact of oxidative stress in female reproduction is not clear. contradictory reports on the effect of various oxidative stress markers on follicular fluid, oocytes and embryo quality and fertilization potential exist. the objectives of this study were to examine reactive oxygen species (ros) levels in follicular fluid of women undergoing ivf and to relate these levels to embryo formation and quality.   methods and results a total of 208 follicular fluid samples were obtained from 78 women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation and analysed for ros and lipid peroxidation (lpo). these samples were divided into groups i and ii which represented follicular fluid containing grade iii and grade ii oocytes, respectively. these groups were further subdivided into groups ia, ib, iia and iib according to embryo quality. subgroups ia and iia consisted of follicular fluid samples corresponding to grade i/ii embryo formation. subgroups ib and iib represented fertilization failure/pro-nucleolus (pn) arrest/grade iii embryos. no significant correlation was observed in ros levels on comparing groups i and ii (p > 0.05). however, ros levels were observed to be significantly different on comparing groups ia and ib (p < or = 0.01) and groups iia and iib (p < or = 0.05). lpo levels further supported our results.   conclusion ros levels in follicular fluid appear to play a significant role in embryo formation and quality.

nuclear aurka acquires kinase-independent transactivating function to enhance breast cancer stem cell phenotype abstract phosphorylation at a highly conserved serine residue (ser-10) in the histone h3 tail is considered to be a crucial event for the onset of mitosis. this modification appears early in the g2 phase within pericentromeric heterochromatin and spreads in an ordered fashion coincident with mitotic chromosome condensation. mutation of ser-10 is essential in tetrahymena, since it results in abnormal chromosome segregation and extensive chromosome loss during mitosis and meiosis, establishing a strong link between signaling and chromosome dynamics. although mitotic h3 phosphorylation has been long recognized, the transduction routes and the identity of the protein kinases involved have been elusive. here we show that the expression of aurora-a and aurora-b, two kinases of the aurora/aik family, is tightly coordinated with h3 phosphorylation during the g2/m transition. during the g2 phase, the aurora-a kinase is coexpressed while the aurora-b kinase colocalizes with phosphorylated histone h3. at prophase and metaphase, aurora-a is highly localized in the centrosomic region and in the spindle poles while aurora-b is present in the centromeric region concurrent with h3 phosphorylation, to then translocate by cytokinesis to the midbody region. both aurora-a and aurora-b proteins physically interact with the h3 tail and efficiently phosphorylate ser10 both in vitro and in vivo, even if aurora-a appears to be a better h3 kinase than aurora-b. since aurora-a and aurora-b are known to be overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, our findings provide an attractive link between cell transformation, chromatin modifications and a specific kinase system.

postabsorptive hyperglucagonemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus analyzed with a novel enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay central administration of the preproglucagon-derived peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 significantly inhibits ingestion of food and water, and glucagon-like peptide-1 binding sites are present in a multitude of central areas involved in the regulation of ingestional behaviour. to evaluate further the neuroanatomical organization of central glucagon-like peptide-1 containing neuronal circuits with potential implications on ingestional behaviour, we carried out a series of experiments in the rat demonstrating the topographical sites of synthesis and processing of the preproglucagon precursor followed by a chromatographic analysis of the processed fragments. in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that preproglucagon encoding messenger rna was expressed in a single population of neurons in the caudal portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract. gel chromatographic analysis of hypothalamic and brainstem tissue extracts revealed that the preproglucagon precursor is processed in a fashion similar to that seen in the small intestine, preferentially giving rise to glicentin, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon-like peptide-2. this single brain site of glucagon-like peptide-1 synthesis was subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemical demonstration of glucagon-like peptide-1-immunoreactive perikarya in the central and caudal parts of the nucleus of the solitary tract. numerous sites containing glucagon-like peptide-1 immunoreactive fibres were, however, discovered in the forebrain including hypothalamic, thalamic and cortical areas. the densest innervation by glucagon-like peptide-1 immunoreactive nerve fibres was seen in the hypothalamic dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei, but numerous glucagon-like peptide-1 immunoreactive fibres were also seen throughout the periventricular strata of the third ventricle. dual-labelling immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase and glucagon-like peptide-1 gave no evidence for co-localization of catecholamines and glucagon-like peptide-1 in neurons of the lower brainstem. to identify neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract that project to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the retrograde tracer fluorogold was injected into this hypothalamic target and dual immunocytochemical identification of glucagon-like peptide-1 and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons was performed on brainstem sections containing retrogradely labelled perikarya. from this experiment it was seen that many of the retrogradely labelled neurons in the central portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract are catecholaminergic, while none is glucagon-like peptide-1 immunoreactive. in contrast, most of the retrogradely labelled neurons of the caudal portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract contain glucagon-like peptide-1. these observations further substantiate that glucagon-like peptide-1 neurons of the solitary tract constitute a distinct non-catecholaminergic cell group which projects to many targets, one of which is the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus.
effect of adiposity on insulin action after acute and chronic resistance exercise in non-diabetic women we examined insulin action/secretion and cardiovascular disease risk factors in japanese subjects with impaired fasting glucose (ifg) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (igt) who were not taking any medications known to affect glucose tolerance, blood pressure (bp) or plasma lipids (pls). a total of 1,399 subjects received measurements of anthropometry, bp, pls, and plasma glucose/insulin concentrations during 75 g-oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt). according to 2003 american diabetes association criteria, subjects were classified as having normal fasting glucose (nfg)/normal glucose tolerance (ngt) (n=1,173), ifg (n=128), igt (n=55), and ifg/igt (n=43). insulin action was calculated using the homa-r (index of hepatic insulin resistance) and matsuda index (reflects whole body insulin sensitivity). the ratio of the incremental area under the curve of insulin to that of glucose during ogtt (δaucpi/δaucpg) was used as an index of β-cell function. homa-r was higher in ifg (2.3±0.1) and ifg/igt (2.5±0.2) than in nfg/ngt (1.8±0.03). the matsuda index was lower in ifg (6.5±0.3), igt (5.4±0.4) and ifg/igt (5.1±0.5) than in nfg/ngt (9.6±0.2). δaucpi/δaucpg was lower in igt (0.6±0.05) and ifg/igt (0.5±0.05) than in ifg (1.4±0.12) or nfg/ngt (1.2±0.03). mean bp was higher in igt (100±1.7 mmhg) than in nfg/ngt (91±0.3) or ifg (95±1.1). the plasma triglyceride level was higher in igt (155±14 mg/dl) and igt/ifg (173±12) than in ifg (132±7) or nfg/ngt (122±2). in conclusion, 1) whole body insulin sensitivity is decreased in ifg and igt, with a greater reduction in igt, 2) hepatic insulin resistance and preserved β-cell function are characteristics of ifg, and 3) higher bp and triglyceride levels are observed in igt. igt is more closely associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease than is ifg.
using statistical moments as invariants for eye detection automatic eye detection and tracking is an important component in the advanced human-computer interface design. in this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting and tracking eyes through matching their terrain features. regarded as a 3d terrain surface, eye region exhibits certain intrinsic traits when using a so-called topographic representation. with the topographic classification of terrain features, we generate a terrain map for each facial image and extract eye candidates from the terrain map. our algorithm mainly consists of two parts. first, eye locations are estimated from the candidate positions using an appearancebased object recognition technique. second, a mutual information based fitting function is defined to describe the similarity between two terrain surfaces. by optimizing the fitting function, eye locations are updated for each frame in a video sequence. the distinction of the proposed approach lies in that both eye detection and eye tracking are performed in a terrain map domain rather than an original intensity image domain. the robustness of the approach is demonstrated under various imaging conditions and with different facial appearances using a web camera.
proton beam characterization by proton-induced acoustic emission: simulation studies. a simple analytical approximation for the proximal part of the depth-dose distribution of a spread-out-bragg-peak (sobp) proton beam is derived. the basic assumption made is that the range-energy relationship follows a power law. the analytical formula depends only on the ratio of the distance from the proximal edge of the sobp and the width of the sobp. a comparison with measurements and with exact numerical calculations reveals a maximum deviation of 5% and a typical deviation of less than 2% of the target dose. the model comprises an analytical expression for the weighting of individual bragg peaks as a function of the range, which is necessary to obtain an sobp of the desired width and depth. finally, an analytical expression for the total energy released in normal tissue is found by integrating the depth-dose distribution.
immune and acute phase response in pigs experimentally infected with h1n2 swine influenza virus. in the present study, acute phase proteins (app) responses in pigs after infection with toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida (pm) were evaluated. twelve piglets from a herd free from toxigenic pm were used. six of them were infected intranasally with pm. crp, hp, saa and pig-map concentrations were measured using commercial elisa tests. crp and hp were significantly induced from 2 days post inoculation (dpi). the concentration of hp in inoculated pigs remained elevated until the end of the study. the concentrations of saa and pig-map increased significantly from 3 dpi, and remained elevated to 5 or 7 dpi, respectively. strong correlations were observed between concentration of hp or saa and changes in the lungs. no correlations were found between levels of app in serum and changes observed in the turbinates. on the basis of our investigation, we cannot state that evaluation of app concentrations in serum may provide useful information about severity of atrophic rhinitis. however, the concentration of all investigated app increased after inoculation. thus, app-measurements may reveal ongoing infection. monitoring of app concentrations in the pig herds may help to pinpoint infected animals even before clinical signs are present. if found, these "app-high" animals may be chosen next for pathogen-specific diagnostics. early diagnosis and therapy may prevent the infection from spreading in the herd. moreover, monitoring of app concentrations in serum may be useful for selecting clinically healthy pigs before integration into an uninfected herd. future studies should focus on the possibility of distinguishing infected and non-infected pigs under field conditions.
automated ensemble assembly and validation of microbial genomes metagenomics projects collect dna from uncharacterized environments that may contain thousands of species per sample. one main challenge facing metagenomic analysis is phylogenetic classification of raw sequence reads into groups representing the same or similar taxa, a prerequisite for genome assembly and for analyzing the biological diversity of a sample. new sequencing technologies have made metagenomics easier, by making sequencing faster, and more difficult, by producing shorter reads than previous technologies. classifying sequences from reads as short as 100 base pairs has until now been relatively inaccurate, requiring researchers to use older, long-read technologies. we present phymm, a classifier for metagenomic data, that has been trained on 539 complete, curated genomes and can accurately classify reads as short as 100 base pairs, a substantial improvement over previous composition-based classification methods. we also describe how combining phymm with sequence alignment algorithms improves accuracy.
spatial dissimilarities in plankton structure and function during flood pulses in a semi-arid floodplain wetland system hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into ‘those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it’. experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. if an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. this approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. for a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. by definition, a prediction is an ‘all-statement’, referring to all systems within a well-defined category. what applies to all must apply to any. hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. the strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. the concept ‘pseudoreplication’ amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.
multiple anti-interferon actions of the influenza a virus ns1 protein the nonstructural protein ns1 of influenza virus is an antagonist of host immune responses and is implicated in virulence. it has two domains, an n-terminal double-stranded rna–binding domain (rbd) and an effector domain crucial for rbd function, for nuclear export and for sequestering messenger rna–processing proteins. here we present the crystallographic structure of the effector domain, which has a novel fold and suggests mechanisms for increased virulence in h5n1 strains.
the ability of cbcl dsm-oriented scales to predict dsm-iv diagnoses in a referred sample of children and adolescents department of psychology, bryn mawr college separately for ages 11/2 to 5 and 6 to 18, used items for rating behavioral and emotional problems to construct (a) "top-down" dsm-oriented scales from experts' ratings of the items' consistency with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed. [dsm-iv], american psychiatric association, 1994) categories, and (b) "bottom-up" empirically based syndromes from factor analyses of parent, caregiver, teacher, and self ratings (n = 14,853). both kinds of scales are scored from the same assessment instruments and are displayed on profiles normed on the same national samples. psychometric properties were similar for both kinds of scales. associations between counterpart scales were medium to strong. quantified, normed dsm-oriented and empirically based scales scored from the same instruments can facilitate assessment of individuals, statistical analyses for research purposes, and integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to deriving constructs for psychopathology.
single-lead f-wave extraction using diffusion geometry. analysis of atrial rhythm is important in the treatment and management of patients with atrial fibrillation. several algorithms exist for extracting the atrial signal from the electrocardiogram (ecg) in atrial fibrillation, but there are few reports on how well these techniques are able to recover the atrial signal. we assessed and compared three algorithms for extracting the atrial signal from the 12-lead ecg. the 12-lead ecgs of 30 patients in atrial fibrillation were analyzed. atrial activity was extracted by three algorithms, spatiotemporal qrst cancellation (stc), principal component analysis (pca), and independent component analysis (ica). the amplitude and frequency characteristics of the extracted atrial signals were compared between algorithms and against reference data. mean (standard deviation) amplitude of qrst segments of v1 was 0.99 (0.54) mv, compared to 0.18 (0.11) mv (stc), 0.19 (0.13) mv (pca), and 0.29 (0.22) mv (ica). hence, for all algorithms there were significant reductions in the amplitude of the ventricular activity compared with that in v1. reference atrial signal amplitude in v1 was 0.18 (0.11) mv, compared to 0.17 (0.10) mv (stc), 0.12 (0.09) mv (pca), and 0.18 (0.13) mv (ica) in the extracted atrial signals. pca tended to attenuate the atrial signal in these segments. there were no significant differences for any of the algorithms when comparing the amplitude of the reference atrial signal with that of the extracted atrial signals in segments in which ventricular activity had been removed. there were no significant differences between algorithms in the frequency characteristics of the extracted atrial signals. there were discrepancies in amplitude and frequency characteristics of the atrial signal in only a few cases resulting from notable residual ventricular activity for pca and ica algorithms. in conclusion, the extracted atrial signals from these algorithms exhibit very similar amplitude and frequency characteristics. users of these algorithms should be observant of residual ventricular activities which can affect the analysis of the fibrillatory waveform in clinical practice.
intracellular fatty acids suppress β-adrenergic induction of pka-targeted gene expression in white adipocytes. chronic activation of adipocyte beta-adrenergic receptors induces remodeling of white adipose tissue (wat) that includes a transient inflammatory response followed by mitochondrial biogenesis, induction of fatty acid oxidation genes, and elevation of tissue oxidative metabolism. gene profiling experiments of wat during remodeling induced by the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist cl-316,243 (cl) suggested that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (ppara), which is upregulated by cl, might be an important transcriptional regulator of that process. histological, physiological, and molecular analysis of cl-induced remodeling in wild-type mice and mice lacking ppara demonstrated that ppara was important for inducing adipocyte mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulating genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. furthermore, ppara-deficient mice exhibited sustained wat inflammation during cl treatment, indicating that upregulation of ppara limits proinflammatory signaling during chronic lipolytic activation. together, these data support the hypothesis that wat remodeling is an adaptive response to excessive fatty acid mobilization whereby ppara and its downstream targets elevate fatty acid catabolism and suppress proinflammatory signaling.
adaptive hierarchical contexts for object recognition with conditional mixture of trees abstract the ability to detect faces in images is of critical ecological significance. it is a pre-requisite for other important face perception tasks such as person identification, gender classification and affect analysis. here we address the question of how the visual system classifies images into face and non-face patterns. we focus on face detection in impoverished images, which allow us to explore information thresholds required for different levels of performance. our experimental results provide lower bounds on image resolution needed for reliable discrimination between face and non-face patterns and help characterize the nature of facial representations used by the visual system under degraded viewing conditions. specifically, they enable an evaluation of the contribution of luminance contrast, image orientation and local context on face-detection performance. research reported in this paper was supported in part by funds from the defense advanced research projects agency and a sloan fellowship for neuroscience to ps.
distributed interactive ray tracing for large volume visualization we examine a rendering system that interactively ray traces an image on a conventional multiprocessor. the implementation is "brute force" in that it explicitly traces rays through every screen pixel, yet pays careful attention to system resources for acceleration. the design of the system is described, along with issues related to material models, lighting and shadows, and frameless rendering. the system is demonstrated for several different types of input scenes.
interactions of betulinic acid with xenobiotic metabolizing and antioxidative enzymes in dmba-treated sprague dawley female rats. we have completed a phase i trial in women of the proposed chemopreventive natural product indole-3-carbinol (i3c). women received oral doses of 400, 600, 800, 1,000, and 1,200 mg i3c. serial plasma samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for i3c and several of its condensation products. i3c itself was not detectable in plasma. the only detectable i3c-derived product was 3,3′-diindolylmethane (dim). mean cmax for dim increased from 61 ng/ml at the 400-mg i3c dose to 607 ng/ml following a 1,000-mg dose. no further increase was observed following a 1,200-mg dose. a similar result was obtained for the area under the curve, which increased from 329 h ng/ml at the 400-mg dose to 3,376 h ng/ml after a 1,000-mg dose of i3c. significant interindividual quantitative variation was seen in plasma dim values within each dosing group, but the overall profiles were qualitatively similar, with no quantifiable dim before dosing, tmax at ∼2 h, and dim levels near or below 15 ng/ml (the limit of quantitation), by 24 h. different results were obtained for 14 subjects who received a 400-mg dose of i3c after 8 weeks of twice-daily i3c dosing. although the predose sampling occurred at least 12 h after the last known ingestion of i3c, 6 of 14 subjects exhibited cmax for dim in their predose plasma. despite this high initial value, plasma dim for all subjects decreased to near or below the limit of quantitation within the 12-h sampling period. possible reasons for this disparity between apparent t1/2 of dim and the high predose values are discussed.

dietary red meat aggravates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice whereas resistant starch attenuates inflammation several dna extraction methods have been reported for use with digesta or fecal samples, but problems are often encountered in terms of relatively low dna yields and/or recovering dna free of inhibitory substances. here we report a modified method to extract pcr-quality microbial community dna from these types of samples, which employs bead beating in the presence of high concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds), salt, and edta, and with subsequent dna purification by qiaamp columns [referred to as repeated bead beating plus column (rbb + c) method]. the rbb + c method resulted in a 1.5- to 6-fold increase in dna yield when compared to three other widely used methods. the community dna prepared with the rbb + c method was also free of inhibitory substances and resulted in improved denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) profiles, which is indicative of a more complete lysis and representation of microbial diversity present in such samples.
scalable nearest neighbor search based on knn graph we introduce a new nearest neighbor search algorithm. the algorithm builds a nearest neighbor graph in an offline phase and when queried with a new point, performs hill-climbing starting from a randomly sampled node of the graph. we provide theoretical guarantees for the accuracy and the computational complexity and empirically show the effectiveness of this algorithm.
down-regulation of promoter methylation level of cd4 gene after mdv infection in md-susceptible chicken line both epigenetic alterations and genetic variations play essential roles in tumorigenesis. the epigenetic modification of dna methylation is catalyzed and maintained by the dna methyltransferases (dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt1). dna mutations and dna methylation profiles of dnmts themselves and their relationships with chicken neoplastic disease resistance and susceptibility are not yet defined. in the present study, we analyzed the complexity of the dna methylation variations and dna mutations in the first exon of three dnmts genes over generations, tissues, and ages among chickens of two highly inbred white leghorn lines, marek's disease-resistant line 63 and -susceptible line 72, and six recombinant congenic strains (rcss). among them, tissue-specific methylation patterns of dnmt3a were disclosed in spleen, liver, and hypothalamus in lines 63 and 72. the methylation level of dnmt3b on four cpg sites was not significantly different among four tissues of the two lines. however, two line-specific dna transition mutations, cpg→tpg (chr20:10203733 and 10203778), were discovered in line 72 compared to the line 63 and rcss. the methylation contents of dnmt1 in blood cell showed significant epimutations in the first cpg site among the two inbred lines and the six rcss (p<0.05). age-specific methylation of dnmt1 was detected in comparisons between 15 month-old and 2 month-old chickens in both lines except in spleen samples from line 72. no dna mutations were discovered on the studied regions of dnmt1 and dnmt3a among the two lines and the six rcss. moreover, we developed a novel method that can effectively test the significance of dna methylation patterns consisting of continuous cpg sites. taken together, these results highlight the potential of epigenetic alterations in dnmt1 and dnmt3a, as well as the dna mutations in dnmt3b, as epigenetic and genetic factors to neoplastic diseases of chickens.
systematic review of factors influencing length of stay in icu after adult cardiac surgery objective:followingcardiacsurgery, agreat varietyinintensivecareunit(icu)stayis observed,makingitoftendifficulttoadequatelypredict icu stay preoperatively. therefore, a study was conducted to investigate, which preoperative variables are independent risk factors for a prolonged icu stay and whether a patient’s risk of experiencing an extended icu stay can be estimated from these predictors. methods: the records of 1566 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution were analysed retrospectively over a 2-year period. procedures included in the analyses were coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement or repair, ascending and aortic arch surgery, ventricular rupture and aneurysm repair, septal myectomy and cardiac tumour surgery. for this patient group, icu stay was registered and 57 preoperative variables were collected for analysis. descriptives and log-rank tests were calculated and kaplan—meier curves drawn for all variables. significant predictors in the univariate analyses were included in a cox proportional hazards model. the definitive model was validated on an independent sample of 395 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution over an additional 6-month period. in this patient group, the accuracy and discriminative abilities of the model were evaluated. results: twelve independent preoperative predictors of prolonged icu stay were identified: age at surgery > 75 years, female gender, dyspnoea status > new york heart association class ii (nyha ii), unstable symptoms, impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) colour flow mapping (cfm) grade ii, inotropic support, intra-aortic balloon pumping (iabp), non-elective procedures and aortic surgery. the individual effect of every predictor on icu stay was quantified and inserted into a mathematical algorithm (called the morbidity defining cardiosurgical (mdc) index), making it possible to calculate a patient’s risk of having an extended icu stay. the model showed very good calibration and very good to excellent discriminative ability in predicting icu stay >2, >5 and >7 days (c-statistic of 0.78; 0.82 and 0.85, respectively). conclusions: twelve independent preoperative risk factors for a prolonged icu stay following cardiac surgery were identified and constructed into a proportional hazards model. using this risk model, one can predict whether a patient will have a prolonged icu stay or not. # 2010 european association for cardio-thoracic surgery. published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
interaction of a 17q12 variant with both fetal and infant smoke exposure in the development of childhood asthma‐like symptoms missingness frequently complicates the analysis of longitudinal data. a popular solution for dealing with incomplete longitudinal data is the use of likelihood-based methods, when, for example, linear, generalized linear, or non-linear mixed models are considered, due to their validity under the assumption of missing at random (mar). semi-parametric methods such as generalized estimating equations (gees) offer another attractive approach but require the assumption of missing completely at random (mcar). weighted gee (wgee) has been proposed as an elegant way to ensure validity under mar. alternatively, multiple imputation (mi) can be used to pre-process incomplete data, after which gee is applied (mi-gee). focusing on incomplete binary repeated measures, both methods are compared using the so-called asymptotic, as well as small-sample, simulations, in a variety of correctly specified as well as incorrectly specified models. in spite of the asymptotic unbiasedness of wgee, results provide striking evidence that mi-gee is both less biased and more accurate in the small to moderate sample sizes which typically arise in clinical trials.
the association between the cross-sectional area of the dural sac and low back pain in a large population: the wakayama spine study musculoskeletal diseases, especially osteoarthritis (oa) and osteoporosis (op), impair activities of daily life (adl) and quality of life (qol) in the elderly. although preventive strategies for these diseases are urgently required in an aging society, epidemiological data on these diseases are scant. to clarify the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (koa), lumbar spondylosis (ls), and osteoporosis (op) in japan, and estimate the number of people with these diseases, we started a large-scale population-based cohort study entitled research on osteoarthritis/osteoporosis against disability (road) in 2005. this study involved the collection of clinical information from three cohorts composed of participants located in urban, mountainous, and coastal areas. koa and ls were radiographically defined as a grade of ≥2 by the kellgren–lawrence scale; op was defined by the criteria of the japanese society for bone and mineral research. the 3,040 participants in total were divided into six groups based on their age: ≤39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥80 years. the prevalence of koa in the age groups ≤39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥80 years 0, 9.1, 24.3, 35.2, 48.2, and 51.6%, respectively, in men, and the prevalence in women of the same age groups was 3.2, 11.4, 30.3, 57.1, 71.9, and 80.7%, respectively. with respect to the age groups, the prevalence of ls was 14.3, 45.5, 72.9, 74.6, 85.3, and 90.1% in men, and 9.7, 28.6, 41.7, 55.4, 75.1, and 78.2% in women, respectively. data of the prevalence of op at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were also obtained. the estimated number of patients with koa, ls, and l2–l4 and femoral neck op in japan was approximately 25, 38, 6.4, and 11 million, respectively. in summary, we estimated the prevalence of oa and op, and the number of people affected with these diseases in japan. the road study will elucidate epidemiological evidence concerning determinants of bone and joint disease.
post-exposure prophylaxis for hiv infection: a clinical trial comparing lopinavir/ritonavir versus atazanavir each with zidovudine/lamivudine. evidence is lacking on the possible efficacy and effectiveness of non-occupational postexposure prophylaxis (pep). however, because of its biological plausibility, the use of antiretroviral (arv) drugs to prevent the development of infection in certain cases of accidental or sporadic exposure has begun to be considered as common clinical practice. previous studies performed in spain have demonstrated both the demand and the prescription of arv as pep and especially the diversity and inconsistency in the criteria used. in this context, in april of 2000 the centre for epidemiological studies on aids of catalonia (ceescat) (department of health and social security of the autonomous government of catalonia), in collaboration with the national aids plan and the aids study group (gesida), promoted the creation of a working group for the drafting of recommendations for pep against hiv outside the occupational health context. the recommendations have been made bearing in mind the exceptional character of the exposure, the time elapsed since exposure, as well as evaluation of the risk of infection according to the type of exposure and the information available on the source of infection. in addition, the recommendations include the immediate measures necessary, as well as the preventive measures and clinical follow-up required both for hiv and for other infectious agents. all pep regimens should be started within 72 hours of exposure and appropriate daily doses of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis) and a protease inhibitor (pi), or two nrtis and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnrtis), should be administered for four weeks, bearing in mind the pharmacological and clinical situation of the source person. these recommendations should be updated periodically.
partnerships in primary care in australia: network structure, dynamics and sustainability. objective this study develops a theoretically justified, network-based model of integrative coordination in community-based health and human services, and it uses this model to measure and compare coordination in six elder service systems.   data sources and study setting we collected data between 1989 and 1991 in six alabama counties, including two major msas, two small msas, and two rural areas. study design and data collection/extraction methods: our measurement of coordination is based on patterns of interorganizational relationships connecting the agencies constituting a community-based health and human services system. within each site, we interviewed representatives from these agencies, asking them to indicate client referral, generalized support, and agenda-setting relationships they had developed with each of the other agencies in the system. using network analysis procedures we then identified the network associated with each of these organizational functions (i.e., service delivery, administration, and planning) in each site, and we assessed levels of coordination in each network.   principal findings our measure of integrative coordination is consistent with other indicators of coordination we derive from our data, suggesting its validity. in addition, levels of integrative coordination across sites for each organizational function are generally comparable. comparisons across sites show integrative coordination to be consistently highest for service delivery networks and lowest for planning networks.   conclusions previous attempts to assess interorganizational coordination without regard to organizational function are subject to misinterpretation. the differing interorganizational dynamics involved in service delivery, administration, and planning appear to generate different patterns of interorganizational relationships, and different levels of coordination.
gender differences in molecular remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy. background we tested the hypothesis that long-term administration of the specific angiotensin ii subtype 1 (at1)-receptor blocker bms-186295 will regress hypertrophy and modify left ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) expression in rats with ascending aortic stenosis.   methods and results six weeks after surgery, rats with ascending aortic stenosis were randomized to receive either the at1-receptor blocker bms-186295 50 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 49), amlodipine 2.5 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 48) as a positive control for systemic vasodilation, or no drug (n = 48) and compared with sham-operated rats (n = 39). drug treatment was continued for 15 weeks. left ventricular ace mrna levels were measured by ribonuclease protection assay. the left ventricular/body weight ratio was increased 43% in hearts from rats with untreated left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) versus control hearts (p < .05). however, there was no difference in either the left ventricular/body weight ratio (2.78 +/- 0.08 versus 2.81 +/- 0.20 mg/g; p = ns) or myocyte cross-sectional area in the at1-blocker-treated versus untreated lvh hearts. amlodipine also showed no effect on regression of hypertrophy. in vivo left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly higher in untreated lvh versus sham-operated rats (193 +/- 8 versus 118 +/- 4 mm hg; p < .05), and there was a similar severe elevation of left ventricular systolic pressure in the at1-blocker- and amlodipine-treated lvh groups (189 +/- 9 and 188 +/- 16 mm hg; p = ns versus untreated lvh). in vivo left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher in the untreated lvh than in the sham-operated rats (14.8 +/- 2.3 versus 7.0 +/- 0.5 mm hg; p < .05). left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was lower in the at1-blocker-treated (11.0 +/- 1.7 mm hg) and amlodipine-treated rats (11.5 +/- 1.8 mm hg) and was similar to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the sham-operated rats (p = ns). left ventricular ace mrna levels were elevated in untreated lvh rats but were normalized in both the at1-blocker-treated rats and amlodipine-treated rats.   conclusions long-term at1-receptor blockade did not regress lvh in rats with persistent systolic pressure overload due to ascending aortic stenosis. however, both at1-receptor blockade and amlodipine improved in vivo left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in association with the normalization of left ventricular ace mrna levels.
investigation and identification of functional post-translational modification sites associated with drug binding and protein-protein interactions protein–protein interactions are central to most biological processes. although much recent effort has been put into methods to identify interacting partners, there has been a limited focus on how these interactions compare with those known from three-dimensional (3d) structures. because comparison of protein interactions often involves considering homologous, but not identical, proteins, a key issue is whether proteins that are homologous to an interacting pair will interact in the same way, or interact at all. accordingly, we describe a method to test putative interactions on complexes of known 3d structure. given a 3d complex and alignments of homologues of the interacting proteins, we assess the fit of any possible interacting pair on the complex by using empirical potentials. for studies of interacting protein families that show different specificities, the method provides a ranking of interacting pairs useful for prioritizing experiments. we evaluate the method on interacting families of proteins with multiple complex structures. we then consider the fibroblast growth factor/receptor system and explore the intersection between complexes of known structure and interactions proposed between yeast proteins by methods such as two-hybrids. we provide confirmation for several interactions, in addition to suggesting molecular details of how they occur.
kidney-brain link in traumatic brain injury patients? a preliminary report objectives: we have sought to develop an automated methodology for the continuous updating of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (cppopt) for patients after severe traumatic head injury, using continuous monitoring of cerebrovascular pressure reactivity. we then validated the cppopt algorithm by determining the association between outcome and the deviation of actual cpp from cppopt. design: retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. setting: neurosciences critical care unit of a university hospital. patients: a total of 327 traumatic head-injury patients admitted between 2003 and 2009 with continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure. measurements and main results: arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and cpp were continuously recorded, and pressure reactivity index was calculated online. outcome was assessed at 6 months. an automated curve fitting method was applied to determine cpp at the minimum value for pressure reactivity index (cppopt). a time trend of cppopt was created using a moving 4-hr window, updated every minute. identification of cppopt was, on average, feasible during 55% of the whole recording period. patient outcome correlated with the continuously updated difference between median cpp and cppopt (chi-square = 45, p < .001; outcome dichotomized into fatal and nonfatal). mortality was associated with relative “hypoperfusion” (cpp < cppopt), severe disability with “hyperperfusion” (cpp > cppopt), and favorable outcome was associated with smaller deviations of cpp from the individualized cppopt. while deviations from global target cpp values of 60 mm hg and 70 mm hg were also related to outcome, these relationships were less robust. conclusions: real-time cppopt could be identified during the recording time of majority of the patients. patients with a median cpp close to cppopt were more likely to have a favorable outcome than those in whom median cpp was widely different from cppopt. deviations from individualized cppopt were more predictive of outcome than deviations from a common target cpp. cpp management to optimize cerebrovascular pressure reactivity should be the subject of future clinical trial in severe traumatic head-injury patients.
pathogenesis of korean sapelovirus a in piglets and chicks abstract the receptor(s) for porcine sapelovirus (psv), which causes diarrhea, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis, and reproductive disorders in pigs, remains largely unknown. given the precedent for other picornaviruses which use terminal sialic acids (sas) as receptors, we examined the role of sas in psv binding and infection. using a variety of approaches, including treating cells with a carbohydrate-destroying chemical (naio4), mono- or oligosaccharides (n-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and 6′-sialyllactose), linkage-specific sialidases (neuraminidase and sialidase s), lectins (maakia amurensis lectin and sambucus nigra lectin), proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and phospholipase c), we demonstrated that psv could recognize α2,3-linked sa on glycolipids as a receptor. on the other hand, psvs had no binding affinity for synthetic histo-blood group antigens (hbgas), suggesting that psvs could not use hbgas as receptors. depletion of cell surface glycolipids followed by reconstitution studies indicated that gd1a ganglioside, but not other gangliosides, could restore psv binding and infection, further confirming α2,3-linked sa on gd1a as a psv receptor. our results could provide significant information on the understanding of the life cycle of sapelovirus and other picornaviruses. for the broader community in the area of pathogens and pathogenesis, these findings and insights could contribute to the development of affordable, useful, and efficient drugs for anti-sapelovirus therapy. importance the porcine sapelovirus (psv) is known to cause enteritis, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis, and reproductive disorders in pigs. however, the receptor(s) that the psv utilizes to enter host cells remains largely unknown. using a variety of approaches, we showed that α2,3-linked terminal sialic acid (sa) on the cell surface gd1a ganglioside could be used for psv binding and infection as a receptor. on the other hand, histo-blood group antigens also present in the cell surface carbohydrates could not be utilized as psv receptors for binding and infection. these findings should contribute to the understanding of the sapelovirus life cycle and to the development of affordable, useful and efficient drugs for anti-sapelovirus therapy.
nucleoid-associated proteins affect mutation dynamics in e. coli in a growth phase-specific manner paml, currently in version 4, is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of dna and protein sequences using maximum likelihood (ml). the programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses. uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (d(n) and d(s)) between two protein-coding dna sequences, inference of positive darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. this note discusses some of the major applications of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their use. the package is written in ansi c, and runs under windows, mac osx, and unix systems. it is available at -- (http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html).
the mechanism of decrease in dynamic mitral regurgitation during heart failure treatment: importance of reduction in the regurgitant orifice size. the proximal flow convergence method, a quantitative color doppler flow technique, has been validated recently for calculating regurgitant flow and orifice area. we investigated the potential of the method as a tool to study different pathophysiological mechanisms of mitral valve incompetence by assessing the time course of regurgitant flow and orifice area and analyzed the implications for quantification of mitral regurgitation. methods and resultsfifty-six consecutive patients with mitral regurgitation of different etiologies were studied. the instantaneous regurgitant flow rate q(t) was computed from color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region and divided by the corresponding orifice velocity v(t) to obtain the instantaneous orifice area at). regurgitant stroke volume (rsv) was obtained by integrating q(t). mean regurgitant flow rate qm was calculated by rsv divided by regurgitation time. peak-to-mean regurgitant flow rates qp/qm and orifice areas a(p)/am were calculated to assess the phasic character of qt)and a(t). in the first 24 patients (group 1), computation of qm and rsv from the color doppler recordings was compared with the conventional pulsed doppler method (r = .94, see=29.4 ml/s and r = .95, see=9.7 ml) as well as with angiography (r,=.93 and r,=.94, p < .001). the temporal variation of q(t) and a(t) was studied in the next 32 patients (group 2): in functional regurgitation in dilated cardiomyopathy (n= 12), there was a constant decrease in at) throughout systole with an increase during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 5.49±3.17. in mitral valve prolapse n=6), a(t) was small in early systole, increasing substantially in midsystole, and decreasing mildly during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 2.48±0.26. in rheumatic mitral regurgitation n= 14), a roughly constant regurgitant orifice area during most of systole was found in 4 patients. in the other patients there was significant variation of ast) and the time of its maximum; ap/am was 1.81 ±0.56. anova demonstrated that the differences in ap/am were related to the etiology of mitral regurgitation (p < .0001). to verify that the calculated variation in regurgitant orifice area during the cardiac cycle reflects an actual variation, the ability of the method to predict a constant orifice area throughout systole was tested experimentally in a canine model of mitral regurgitation. five flow stages were produced by implanting fixed grommet orifices of different sizes into the anterior mitral leaflet. a constant regurgitant orifice area was correctly predicted throughout systole with a mean percent error of −1.8±4% (from −6.9% to ±5.8%); the standard deviation of the individual curves calculated at 10% intervals during systole averaged 13.3% (from 3.6% to 19.6%). in addition, functional mitral regurgitation caused by ventricular dysfunction was produced pharmacologically in five dogs, and the color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region were obtained with the transducer placed directly on the heart instead of the chest, thus ruling out a significant effect of translational motion on the observed flow pattern. the pattern of regurgitant flow variation was identical to that observed in patients. conclusionsthe proximal flow convergence method demonstrates that regurgitant flow and orifice area vary throughout systole in distinct patterns characteristic of the underlying mechanism of mitral incompetence. therefore, in addition to the potential of the method as a tool to quantify mitral regurgitation, it allows analysis of the pathophysiology of regurgitation in the individual patient, which may be helpful in clinical decision making. calculating mitral regurgitant flow rate and volume from the time-varying proximal flow field (ie, without assuming a constant orifice area that would produce overestimation in individual patients) provides excellent agreement with independent techniques and agrees well with angiography.
a novel human detection approach based on depth map via kinect conventional human detection is mostly done in images taken by visible-light cameras. these methods imitate the detection process that human use. they use features based on gradients, such as histograms of oriented gradients (hog), or extract interest points in the image, such as scale-invariant feature transform (sift), etc. in this paper, we present a novel human detection method using depth information taken by the kinect for xbox 360. we propose a model based approach, which detects humans using a 2-d head contour model and a 3-d head surface model. we propose a segmentation scheme to segment the human from his/her surroundings and extract the whole contours of the figure based on our detection point. we also explore the tracking algorithm based on our detection result. the methods are tested on our database taken by the kinect in our lab and present superior results.
time‐varying view angle tilting with spiral readout gradients the exact, hardware‐constrained design of a spiral k‐space trajectory requires the solution of a differential equation, thereby making real‐time prescription difficult on scanners with limited computational power. this study describes a closed‐form approximate solution for interleaved archimedian spiral trajectories that closely matches the exact design. both slew rate‐limited and amplitude‐limited regimes are incorporated. magn reson med 42:412–415, 1999. © 1999 wiley‐liss, inc.
dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids enhance hormone ablation therapy in androgen-dependent prostate cancer. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are antitumorigenic in humans as well as in animal models of intestinal neoplasia, such as the adenomatous polyposis coli min/ (apc ) mouse. nsaids inhibit cyclooxygenase (cox) isozymes, which are responsible for the committed step in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and this has been considered the primary mechanism by which nsaids exert their antitumorigenic effects. however, mounting evidence suggests the existence of cox-independent mechanisms. in the present study, we attempted to clarify this issue by treating apc mice bearing established tumors with nsaids (piroxicam and sulindac, 0.5 and 0.6 mg/mouse/day, respectively) for 6 days and concomitantly bypassing cox inhibition by treatment with the e prostaglandin (ep) receptor agonists 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin e2 (pge2) and 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2 (10 g each, three times daily) administered via gavage and/or i.p. routes. treatment with piroxicam and sulindac resulted in 95% and 52% fewer tumors, respectively, and a higher ratio of apoptosis:mitosis in tumors from sulindac-treated mice as compared with controls. these effects were attenuated by concomitant ep receptor agonist treatment, suggesting pge2 is important in the maintenance of tumor integrity. immunological sequestration of pge2 with an anti-pge2 monoclonal antibody likewise resulted in 33% fewer tumors in apc mice relative to untreated controls, additionally substantiating a role for pge2 in tumorigenesis. the ep receptor subtype ep1 mediates the effects of pge2 by increasing intracellular calcium levels ([ca 2 ]i), whereas antagonism of ep1 has been shown to attenuate tumorigenesis in apc mice. we demonstrate that [ca ]i is significantly elevated in tumors of apc min/ mice relative to the adjacent normal-appearing mucosa. furthermore, treatment with piroxicam results in significantly lower [ca ]i in tumors, and this effect is attenuated by concomitant treatment with the ep1/ep3 receptor agonist 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2. overall, our results suggest that nsaids exert their antitumorigenic effects, in part, via interference with pge2 biosynthesis, and these effects may be mediated through changes in intracellular calcium levels.
nnll-fast: predictions for coloured supersymmetric particle production at the lhc with threshold and coulomb resummation abstract in qcd hard scattering cross sections, the color content of the underlying hard scattering evolves with a factorization scale. this evolution is controlled by an anomalous dimension matrix, specific to each hard-scattering reaction. anomalous dimensions are determined from the renormalization of products of ordered exponentials of the gauge field, which describe the coherent radiation of gluons by incoming hadrons and the observed jets or particles of the final state. the anomalous dimensions depend on the kinematics of the underlying hard scattering, but are free of collinear singularities. a number of these matrices are available in the literature. here, we exhibit one-loop mixing matrices for the full list of 2 → 2 reactions involving light quarks and gluons. the eight-by-eight anomalous dimension matrix for gluon-gluon scattering shows a simplified structure in the basis corresponding to definite color exchange in the t -channel.
a systematic review on the rosa canina effect and efficacy profiles the antioxidative activity of a total of 92 phenolic extracts from edible and nonedible plant materials (berries, fruits, vegetables, herbs, cereals, tree materials, plant sprouts, and seeds) was examined by autoxidation of methyl linoleate. the content of total phenolics in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the folin-ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (gae). among edible plant materials, remarkable high antioxidant activity and high total phenolic content (gae > 20 mg/g) were found in berries, especially aronia and crowberry. apple extracts (two varieties) showed also strong antioxidant activity even though the total phenolic contents were low (gae < 12.1 mg/g). among nonedible plant materials, high activities were found in tree materials, especially in willow bark, spruce needles, pine bark and cork, and birch phloem, and in some medicinal plants including heather, bog-rosemary, willow herb, and meadowsweet. in addition, potato peel and beetroot peel extracts showed strong antioxidant effects. to utilize these significant sources of natural antioxidants, further characterization of the phenolic composition is needed.
identification of multivesicular bodies as prevacuolar compartments in nicotiana tabacum by-2 cells online version contains web-only data. prevacuolar compartments (pvcs) are membrane-bound organelles that mediate protein traffic between golgi and vacuoles in the plant secretory pathway. here we identify and define organelles as the lytic prevacuolar compartments in pea and tobacco cells using confocal immunofluorescence. we use five different antibodies specific for a vacuolar sorting receptor (vsr) bp-80 and its homologs to detect the location of vsr proteins. in addition, we use well-established golgi-markers to identify golgi organelles. we further compare vsr-labeled organelles to golgi organelles so that the relative proportion of vsr proteins in golgi vs. pvcs can be quantitated. more than 90% of the bp-80-marked organelles are separate from golgi organelles; thus, bp-80 and its homologs are predominantly concentrated on the lytic pvcs. additionally, organelles marked by anti-atpep12p (atsyp21p) and anti-atelp antibodies are also largely separate from golgi apparatus, whereas vsr and atpep12p (atsyp21p) were largely colocalized. we have thus demonstrated in plant cells that vsr proteins are predominantly present in the lytic pvcs and have provided additional markers for defining plant pvcs using confocal immunofluorescence. additionally, our approach will provide a rapid comparison between markers to quantitate protein distribution among various organelles.
tcr-cxcr4 signaling stabilizes cytokine mrna transcripts via a prex1-rac1 pathway: implications for ctcl. c-kit positive cardiac stem cells (cscs) have been shown to contribute to myocardial regeneration after infarction. previously, we have shown that the c-kit ligand stem cell factor (scf) can induce csc migration into the infarcted area during myocardial infarction (mi). however, the precise mechanism involved is not fully understood. in this study, we found that cscs also express c-x-c chemokine receptor type 4 (cxcr4), which is a typical member of the seven transmembrane-spanning g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr). in vitro, activation of c-kit signalling by scf promotes migration of cscs with increased phosphorylation of cxcr4-serine 339, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 mapk) and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (erk1/2). knockdown of cxcr4 expression by sirna reduces scf/c-kit-induced migration and downstream signalling. as previously reported, cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation is mainly regulated by gpcr kinase 6 (grk6); thus, silencing of grk6 expression by sirna impairs cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation and migration of cscs caused by scf. in vivo, knockdown of grk6 impairs the ability of cscs to migrate into peri-infarcted areas. these results demonstrate that scf-induced csc migration is regulated by the transactivation of cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation, which is mediated by grk6.
functional gene variants of the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 in migraine panic disorder is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent anxiety attacks and anticipatory anxiety. due to the severity of the symptoms of the panic attacks and the frequent additional occurrence of agoraphobia, panic disorder is an often debilitating disease. elevation of central serotonin levels by drugs such as clomipramine represents one of the most effective treatment options for panic disorder. this points to an important role of dysregulation of the serotonergic system in the genetic etiology of panic disorder. the novel brain-specific 5-ht synthesizing enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (tph2), which represents the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-ht production in the brain, may therefore be of particular importance in panic disorder. we focused on the putative transcriptional control region of tph2 and identified two novel common single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of tph2 in and close to this region. moreover, a recently described loss-of-function mutation of tph2 which results in an 80% reduction of serotonin production, was assessed. in an analysis of the putative transcriptional control region snps in a sample of panic disorder patients and controls no association of the disorder with the tph2 snps or haplotypes was found. moreover, the loss-of-function r441h mutation of tph2 was not present in the panic disorder patients. the results of this first study of tph2 in panic disorder argue against an importance of allelic variation of tph2 in the pathogenesis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.
determining the time period and amount of training data for stock exchange of thailand index prediction this paper proposes the prediction method for stock exchange of thailand index (set index). the proposed method was adapted from [1] by adding more important factors to the prediction function. this research takes into account both external and internal factors to forecast the set index. the external factors are the historical movement of the world's major stock exchange market indices such as dow jones, nikkei and hang seng index, while the internal factors are the historical movement of the set index and minimum loan rate (mlr). the experimental result on both short and long term data show that the proposed method has lower errors for both mean squared error (mse) and mean absolute percentage error (mape) measures. in addition, the proposed function can be put into the spreadsheet which makes it easier and faster for the investors to analyze the trend of stock exchange market.
aortic, cerebral and lower limb arterial and venous response to orthostatic stress after a 60-day bedrest aim:  the goal of this investigation was to test specific exercise and nutrition countermeasures to lower limb skeletal muscle volume and strength losses during 60 days of simulated weightlessness (6° head‐down‐tilt bed rest).
segmentation of cell structures in fluorescence confocal microscopy images segmentation and tracking of cells in fluorescence microscopy image sequences is an important task in many biological studies into cell migration as well as intracellular dynamics. the growing size and complexity of biological image data sets precludes manual analysis, and calls for increasingly advanced automatic algorithms that are generic enough to be easily tunable to different applications, yet robust enough to deal with different cell types and strongly varying imaging conditions. active-contour based algorithms have proven to be very suitable for this purpose but still suffer from several shortcomings that limit their segmentation accuracy and tracking robustness. in addition, these algorithms are generally rather computationally expensive. in this paper, we present an advanced level-set based multiple-cell segmentation and tracking algorithm, which implements seven modifications compared to earlier algorithms that considerably improve its performance. preliminary experiments on three different time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images demonstrate the potential of the new algorithm.
classification of degraded cartilage through multiparametric mri analysis. purpose to improve the reliability, accuracy, and computational efficiency of tissue classification with multispectral sequences [t1, t2, and proton density (pd)], we developed an automated method for identifying training classes to be used in a discriminant function analysis. we compared it with a supervised operator-dependent method, evaluating its reliability and validity. we also developed a fuzzy (continuous) classification to correct for partial voluming.   method images were obtained on a 1.5 t ge signa mr scanner using three pulse sequences that were co-registered. training classes for the discriminant analysis were obtained in two ways. the operator-dependent method involved defining circular rois containing 5-15 voxels that represented "pure" samples of gray matter (gm), white matter (wm), and cerebrospinal fluid (csf), using a total of 150-300 voxels for each tissue type. the automated method involved selecting a large number of samples of brain tissue with sufficiently low variance and randomly placed throughout the brain ("plugs"), partitioning these samples into gm, wm, and csf, and minimizing the amount of variance within each partition of samples to optimize its "purity." the purity of the plug was estimated by calculating the variance of 8 voxels in all modalities (t1, t2, and pd). we also compared "sharp" (discrete) measurements (which classified tissue only as gm, wm, or csf) and "fuzzy" (continuous) measurements (which corrected for partial voluming by weighting the classification based on the mixture of tissue types in each voxel).   results reliability was compared for the operator-dependent and automated methods as well as for the fuzzy versus sharp classification. the automated sharp classifications consistently had the highest interrater and intrarater reliability. validity was assessed in three ways: reproducibility of measurements when the same individuals were scanned on multiple occasions, sensitivity of the method to detecting changes associated with aging, and agreement between the automated segmentation values and those produced through expert manual segmentation. the sharp automated classification emerged as slightly superior to the other three methods according to each of these validators. its reproducibility index (intraclass r) was 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98 for total csf, total gm, and total wm, respectively. its correlations with age were 0.54, -0.61, and -0.53, respectively. its percent agreement with the expert manually segmented tissue for the three tissue types was 93, 90, and 94%, respectively.   conclusion automated identification of training classes for discriminant analysis was clearly superior to a method that required operator intervention. a sharp (discrete) classification into three tissue types was also slightly superior to one that used "fuzzy" classification to produce continuous measurements to correct for partial voluming. this multispectral automated discriminant analysis method produces a computationally efficient, reliable, and valid method for classifying brain tissue into gm, wm, and csf. it corrects some of the problems with reliability and computational inefficiency previously observed for operator-dependent approaches to segmentation.
a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
embedded effort indicators on the california verbal learning test – second edition (cvlt–ii): an attempted cross-validation this study determined whether performance patterns on the california verbal learning test-ii (cvlt-ii) could differentiate participants with traumatic brain injury (tbi) showing adequate effort from those with mild tbi exhibiting poor effort using a case-control design. the tbi group consisted of 124 persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). the poor effort group consisted of 77 persons with mild head injury who were involved in litigation (lg) and failed at least one stand-alone symptom validity measure (svt) and also either a second svt or an effort indicator embedded within a standard clinical test. a total of 18 cvlt-ii variables were investigated using bayesian model averaging (bma) for logistic regression to determine which variables best differentiated the groups. the cvlt-ii variables having the most support were long-delay free recall, total recognition discriminability (d′), and total recall discriminability.
trigonelline attenuates hepatic complications and molecular alterations in high-fat high-fructose diet-induced insulin resistance in rats. summarythe steady-state basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are determined by their interaction in a feedback loop. a computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of β-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient β-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, homa). the accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and β-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. the estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (rs = 0.88, p < 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (rs = 0.81, p < 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (rs = 0.69, p < 0.01). there was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. the estimate of deficient β-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (rs = 0.61, p < 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (rs = 0.64, p < 0.05). the low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31% for insulin resistance and 32% for β-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop.
neurocognitive functioning in patients with first-episode schizophrenia the history, rationale, and development of the structured clinical interview for dsm-iii-r (scid) is described. the scid is a semistructured interview for making the major axis i dsm-iii-r diagnoses. it is administered by a clinician and includes an introductory overview followed by nine modules, seven of which represent the major axis i diagnostic classes. because of its modular construction, it can be adapted for use in studies in which particular diagnoses are not of interest. using a decision tree approach, the scid guides the clinician in testing diagnostic hypotheses as the interview is conducted. the output of the scid is a record of the presence or absence of each of the disorders being considered, for current episode (past month) and for lifetime occurrence.
molecular etiology of an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder determined by whole-genome sequencing jaguar is an alignment protocol for rna-seq reads that uses an extended reference to increase alignment sensitivity. it uses bwa to align reads to the genome and reference transcript models (including annotated exon-exon junctions) specifically allowing for the possibility of a single read spanning multiple exons. reads aligned to the transcript models are then re-mapped on to genomic coordinates, transforming alignments that span multiple exons into large-gapped alignments on the genome. while jaguar does not detect novel junctions, we demonstrate how jaguar generates fast and accurate transcriptome alignments, which allows for both sensitive and specific snv calling.
the prognostic value of tp53 mutations in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma objective: molecular targeting therapy  has not been generally established in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  (hnscc) except for cetuximab treatment for targeting epidermal growth factor  receptor (egfr). we analyzed alterations of the tp53, kras2, and egfr genes  in japanese hnscc to identify subpopulations of tumors potentially susceptible  or not susceptible to specific therapy based on their genetic alterations.  materials and methods: a total of 56 japanese subjects were included in this  study. genomic dna of exons 5 - 9 of the tp53, exons 1 and 2 of the kras2,  exons 19 - 22 of the egfr, and their flanking sequences were  amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by direct sequencing.  splicing variants of egfr were examined by reverse  transcription (rt)-pcr. results: mutations of the tp53 and kras genes  were detected in 25 (45%) and 2 (4%) of 56 hnscc cases, respectively, while  neither mutation nor splicing variant of egfr was observed.  the tp53 mutation did not correlate with clinical stages or primary  sites of the tumors. the patterns of nucleotide substitutions specific to hnscc  were not observed. however, the incidence of null-type mutations of the tp53, which  cannot be detected as abnormal by conventional immunohistochemical (ihc)  studies, was significantly higher (10/25; 40%) than that of hnscc reported in  other countries. conclusion: frequent tp53 mutations, especially  null-type mutations, but infrequent or no alterations of the kras and egfr suggest  that the sequencing analysis of thetp53 mutation rather than ihc  analysis of p53 provides a potentially useful marker to predict the response of  hnscc to chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
multipitch estimation by joint modeling of harmonic and transient sounds the perception of pitch forms the basis of musical melody and harmony. it is also among the most precise of all our human senses, and with imagination, this precision can be used experimentally to investigate the functioning of the auditory system. this tutorial presents auditory demonstrations from the zoo of pitch effects: pitch shifts, noise pitch, virtual pitch, dichotic pitch, and the pitches of things that are not there at all. it introduces models of auditory processing, derived from contemporary psychoacoustics and auditory physiology, and tests these models against the experimental effects. it concludes by describing the critical role played by pitch in the important human ability to disentangle overlapping sources of sound.
heterogeneity in hepatitis c treatment prescribing and uptake in australia: a geospatial analysis of a year of unrestricted treatment access background poor access to health services is a significant barrier to achieving the world health organization’s hepatitis c virus (hcv) elimination targets. we demonstrate how geospatial analysis can be performed with commonly available data to identify areas with the greatest unmet demand for hcv services. methods we performed an australia-wide cross-sectional analysis of 2015 hcv notification rates using local government areas (lgas) as our unit of analysis. a zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to determine associations between notification rates and socioeconomic/demographic factors, health service and geographic remoteness area (ra) classification variables. additionally, component scores were extracted from a principal component analysis (pca) of the healthcare service variables to provide rankings of relative service coverage and unmet demand across australia. results among lgas with non-zero notifications, higher rates were associated with areas that had increased socioeconomic disadvantage, more needle and syringe services (incidence rate ratio [irr] 1.022; 95%ci 1.001, 1.044) and more alcohol and other drug services (irr 1.019; 1.005, 1.034). the distribution of pca component scores indicated that per-capita healthcare service coverage was lower in areas outside of major australian cities. areas outside of major cities also contained 94% of lgas in the lowest two socioeconomic quintiles, as well as 35% of hcv notifications despite only representing 29% of the population. conclusions as countries aim for hcv elimination, routinely collected data can be used to identify geographical areas for priority service delivery. in australia, the unmet demand for hcv treatment services is greatest in socioeconomically disadvantaged and non-metropolitan areas.
use it and improve it or lose it: interactions between arm function and use in humans post-stroke background and purpose— in research on constraint-induced movement (ci) therapy, a structured interview, the motor activity log (mal), is used to assess how stroke survivors use their more-impaired arm outside the laboratory. this article examines the psychometrics of the 14-item version of this instrument in 2 chronic stroke samples with mild-to-moderate upper-extremity hemiparesis. methods— participants (n=41) in the first study completed mals before and after ci therapy or a placebo control procedure. in addition, caregivers independently completed a mal on the participants. participants (n=27) in the second study completed mals and wore accelerometers that monitored their arm movements for 3 days outside the laboratory before and after an automated form of ci therapy. results— validity of the participant mal quality of movement (qom) scale was supported. correlations between pretreatment-to-posttreatment change scores on the participant qom scale and caregiver mal qom scale, caregiver mal amount of use (aou) scale, and accelerometer recordings were 0.70, 0.73, and 0.91 (p<0.01), respectively. internal consistency (α>0.81), test–retest reliability (r>0.91), stability, and responsiveness (ratio >3) of the participant qom scale were also supported. the participant aou and caregiver qom and aou scales were internally consistent, stable, and sensitive, but were not reliable. conclusions— the participant mal qom scale can be used exclusively to reliably and validly measure real-world, upper-extremity rehabilitation outcome and functional status in chronic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate hemiparesis.
domain adaptation with adversarial neural networks and auto-encoders deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. however, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. the key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. this prevents units from co-adapting too much. during training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. at test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. this significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. we show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.
computer aided diagnosis of degenerative intervertebral disc diseases from lumbar mr images in this paper we propose a robust and fully automated lumbar herniation diagnosis system based on clinical mri data which will not only aid a radiologist to make a decision with increased confidence, but will also reduce the time needed to analyze each case. our method is based on three steps: 1) we automatically label the five lumbar intervertebral discs in a sagittal mri slice using a probabilistic model and then extract an roi for each disc using an active shape model. 2) we generate relevant intensity and texture features from each disc roi. 3) we construct five different classifiers (svm, pca+lda, pca+naive bayes, pca+qda, pca+svm) and combine them in a majority voting scheme. we perform 5-fold cross-validation experiments and achieve an accuracy of 94.85%, specificity of 95.9% and sensitivity of 92.45% for 35 clinical cases, i.e. a total of 175 lumbar intervertebral discs.

chronic exposure to high levels of zinc or copper has little effect on brain metal homeostasis or aβ accumulation in transgenic app-c100 mice to study if treatment with zinc (zn) was able to restore to normal levels the depressed immune response determined by oral administration of excess copper (cu), groups of mice receiving 100 ppm or 200 ppm of cu in the drinking water for 8 weeks, were injected ip once a week with zn (1.14 mg/kg of body weight), throughout the experimental period. administration of zn restored to normal levels the proliferative response to mitogens and the antibody response to sheep red blood cells in the group of mice receiving 100 ppm of cu in the drinking water. similarly, the treatment with zn significantly enhanced the depressed proliferative response to mitogens and the antibody response to sheep red blood cells of mice receiving 200 ppm of cu in the drinking water. by contrast, increment in zn supply was not able to modify the high production of auto-antibodies observed in animals receiving excess cu. the results suggest that the impairment of the immune response observed in animals receiving excess cu could be in part due to antagonistic interactions between this cation and zn.
a computational study of whole-brain connectivity in resting state and task fmri an automated coordinate‐based system to retrieve brain labels from the 1988 talairach atlas, called the talairach daemon (td), was previously introduced [lancaster et al., 1997 ]. in the present study, the td system and its 3‐d database of labels for the 1988 talairach atlas were tested for labeling of functional activation foci. td system labels were compared with author‐designated labels of activation coordinates from over 250 published functional brain‐mapping studies and with manual atlas‐derived labels from an expert group using a subset of these activation coordinates. automated labeling by the td system compared well with authors' labels, with a 70% or greater label match averaged over all locations. author‐label matching improved to greater than 90% within a search range of ±5 mm for most sites. an adaptive grey matter (gm) range‐search utility was evaluated using individual activations from the m1 mouth region (30 subjects, 52 sites). it provided an 87% label match to brodmann area labels (ba 4 & ba 6) within a search range of ±5 mm. using the adaptive gm range search, the td system's overall match with authors' labels (90%) was better than that of the expert group (80%). when used in concert with authors' deeper knowledge of an experiment, the td system provides consistent and comprehensive labels for brain activation foci. additional suggested applications of the td system include interactive labeling, anatomical grouping of activation foci, lesion‐deficit analysis, and neuroanatomy education. hum. brain mapping 10:120–131, 2000. © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc.
caffeine ingestion improves power output decrement during 3-min all-out exercise purpose we tested the hypothesis that a 3-min all-out cycling test would provide a measure of peak oxygen uptake (vo2peak) and estimate the maximal steady-state power output.   methods eleven habitually active subjects performed a ramp test, three 3-min all-out tests against a fixed resistance, and two further submaximal tests lasting up to 30 min, 15 w below or above the power output attained in the last 30 s of the 3-min test (the end-test power).   results the vo2peak measured during the 3-min all-out test (mean +/- sd: 3.78 +/- 0.68 l x min(-1)) was not different from that of the ramp test (3.84 +/- 0.79 l x min(-1); p = 0.75). the end-test power (257 +/- 49 w) was significantly lower than that at the end of the ramp test (368 +/- 73 w) and significantly higher than the power at the gas exchange threshold (169 +/- 55 w; p < 0.001). nine subjects were able to complete 30 min of exercise at 15 w below the end-test power, and seven of these did so with a steady-state blood [lactate] and vo2 response profile. in contrast, when subjects exercised at 15 w above the end-test power, blood [lactate] and vo2 rose inexorably until exhaustion, which occurred in approximately 13 +/- 7 min.   conclusions these data suggest that a 3-min all-out exercise test can be used to establish vo2peak and to estimate the maximal steady state.

the anterior medial amygdala transmits sexual odor information to the posterior medial amygdala and related forebrain nuclei a battery of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against brain cell nuclei has been generated by repeated immunizations. one of these, mab a60, recognizes a vertebrate nervous system- and neuron-specific nuclear protein that we have named neun (neuronal nuclei). the expression of neun is observed in most neuronal cell types throughout the nervous system of adult mice. however, some major cell types appear devoid of immunoreactivity including cerebellar purkinje cells, olfactory bulb mitral cells, and retinal photoreceptor cells. neun can also be detected in neurons in primary cerebellar cultures and in retinoic acid-stimulated p19 embryonal carcinoma cells. immunohistochemically detectable neun protein first appears at developmental timepoints which correspond with the withdrawal of the neuron from the cell cycle and/or with the initiation of terminal differentiation of the neuron. neun is a soluble nuclear protein, appears as 3 bands (46-48 x 10(3) m(r)) on immunoblots, and binds to dna in vitro. the mab crossreacts immunohistochemically with nervous tissue from rats, chicks, humans, and salamanders. this mab and the protein recognized by it serve as an excellent marker for neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems in both the embryo and adult, and the protein may be important in the determination of neuronal phenotype.
hepatic pedicle clamping during hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases: no impact on survival or hepatic recurrence objective there is a need for clearly defined and widely applicable clinical criteria for the selection of patients who may benefit from hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. such criteria would also be useful for stratification of patients in clinical trials for this disease.   methods clinical, pathologic, and outcome data for 1001 consecutive patients undergoing liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer between july 1985 and october 1998 were examined. these resections included 237 trisegmentectomies, 394 lobectomies, and 370 resections encompassing less than a lobe. the surgical mortality rate was 2.8%.   results the 5-year survival rate was 37%, and the 10-year survival rate was 22%. seven factors were found to be significant and independent predictors of poor long-term outcome by multivariate analysis: positive margin (p = 0.004), extrahepatic disease (p = 0.003), node-positive primary (p = 0.02), disease-free interval from primary to metastases <12 months (p = 0.03), number of hepatic tumors >1 (p = 0.0004), largest hepatic tumor >5 cm (p = 0.01), and carcinoembryonic antigen level >200 ng/ml (p = 0.01). when the last five of these criteria were used in a preoperative scoring system, assigning one point for each criterion, the total score was highly predictive of outcome (p < 0.0001). no patient with a score of 5 was a long-term survivor.   conclusion resection of hepatic colorectal metastases may produce long-term survival and cure. long-term outcome can be predicted from five criteria that are readily available for all patients considered for resection. patients with up to two criteria can have a favorable outcome. patients with three, four, or five criteria should be considered for experimental adjuvant trials. studies of preoperative staging techniques or of adjuvant therapies should consider using such a score for stratification of patients.
continuous monitoring in the dynamic sensor field model we introduce a formal model of computation for networks of tiny artifacts, the static synchronous sensor field model (sssf) which considers that the devices communicate through a fixed communication graph and interact with the environment through input/output data streams. we analyze the performance of sssfs solving two sensing problems the average monitoring and the alerting problems. for constant memory sssfs we show that the set of recognized languages is contained in dspace(n + m) where n is the number of nodes of the communication graph and m its number of edges. finally we explore the capabilities of sssfs having sensing and additional non-sensing constant memory devices.
defects in insulin signal transduction in liver and muscle of pregnant rats growth factors stimulate the enzyme phosphatidylinositol (pi) 3-kinase in cells in culture. insulin rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of its endogenous substrate, insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs-1), and in vitro irs-1 associates with pi 3-kinase, thus activating the enzyme. we have examined whether insulin is capable of stimulating the pi 3-kinase pathway in two physiological target tissues for the actions of insulin in vivo, liver and skeletal muscle. after intraportal injection of insulin into anesthetized rats, there was a 2-fold stimulation of total hepatic pi 3-kinase activity in liver and muscle extracts and a 10- to 20-fold increase in pi 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated with anti-irs-1 antibodies. stimulation of pi 3-kinase was accompanied by an association between this enzyme and irs-1 as detected by immunoprecipitation of liver and muscle extracts with anti-irs-1 antibodies and western blotting with antibodies to the 85-kda subunit of pi 3-kinase. immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 antibodies and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting revealed no tyrosine phosphorylation of pi 3-kinase, but demonstrated co-precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated irs-1, as well as another phosphotyrosine protein of approximately 135-140 kda. thus, irs-1 phosphorylation plays a significant role in the activation of pi 3-kinase in vivo by insulin.
the overexpression of nalp3 inflammasome in knee osteoarthritis is associated with synovial membrane prolidase and nadph oxidase 2 principal component analysis is often incorporated into genome-wide expression studies, but what is it and how can it be used to explore high-dimensional data?
whole-genome sequencing of a quarter-century melioidosis outbreak in temperate australia uncovers a region of low-prevalence endemicity we have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called "velvet," to manipulate de bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. a de bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. applying velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb n50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb n50 on simulated mammalian bacs. when applied to real solexa data sets without read pairs, velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian bac, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.
multi-level multi-task structured sparse learning for diagnosis of schizophrenia disease in multi-task learning (mtl), multiple related tasks are learned jointly by sharing information across them. many mtl algorithms have been proposed to learn the underlying task groups. however, those methods are limited to learn the task groups at only a single level, which may be not sufficient to model the complex structure among tasks in many real-world applications. in this paper, we propose a multi-level task grouping (metag) method to learn the multi-level grouping structure instead of only one level among tasks. specifically, by assuming the number of levels to be h, we decompose the parameter matrix into a sum of h component matrices, each of which is regularized with a l2 norm on the pairwise difference among parameters of all the tasks to construct level-specific task groups. for optimization, we employ the smoothing proximal gradient method to efficiently solve the objective function of the metag model. moreover, we provide theoretical analysis to show that under certain conditions the metag model can recover the true parameter matrix and the true task groups in each level with high probability. we experiment our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing competitive performance over state-of-the-art mtl methods.
pain modulation in waking and hypnosis in women: event-related potentials and sources of cortical activity abstract a short scale for the measurement of hypnotic responsiveness was constructed for use with patients for whom the standard scales might prove too long, too uninteresting, or too tiring. five items were selected: moving hands together, a dream, age regression, a posthypnotic suggestion, and posthypnotic amnesia. a sample of 111 university undergraduates, selected from the full range of scores (0–10) on a shortened 10-point version of the harvard group scale of hypnotic susceptibility, form a, was given the 5-point clinical scale and the 12-point stanford hypnotic scale, form c in balanced order. there were no order effects. a reliability estimate for the clinical scale was obtained from the product-moment correlation between the total scores on the two scales. this correlation was .72. the clinical scale requires approximately 20 minutes for administration.
physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine in adults and children. part 2: 6-mercaptopurine and its interaction with methotrexate the tissue:plasma (p(t:p)) partition coefficients (pcs) are important drug-specific input parameters in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) models used to estimate the disposition of drugs in biota. until now the use of pbpk models in early stages of the drug discovery process was not possible, since the estimation of p(t:p) of new drug candidates by using conventional in vitro and/or in vivo methods is too time and cost intensive. the objectives of the study were (i) to develop and validate two mechanistic equations for predicting a priori the rabbit, rat and mouse p(t:p) of non-adipose and non-excretory tissues (bone, brain, heart, intestine, lung, muscle, skin, spleen) for 65 structurally unrelated drugs and (ii) to evaluate the adequacy of using p(t:p) of muscle as predictors for p(t:p) of other tissues. the first equation predicts p(t:p) at steady state, assuming a homogenous distribution and passive diffusion of drugs in tissues, from a ratio of solubility and macromolecular binding between tissues and plasma. the ratio of solubility was estimated from log vegetable oil:water pcs (k(vo:w)) of drugs and lipid and water levels in tissues and plasma, whereas the ratio of macromolecular binding for drugs was estimated from tissue interstitial fluid-to-plasma concentration ratios of albumin, globulins and lipoproteins. the second equation predicts p(t:p) of drugs residing predominantly in the interstitial space of tissues. therefore, the fractional volume content of interstitial space in each tissue replaced drug solubilities in the first equation. following the development of these equations, regression analyses between p(t:p) of muscle and those of the other tissues were examined. the average ratio of predicted-to-experimental p(t:p) values was 1.26 (sd = 1.40, r = 0.90, n = 269), and 85% of the 269 predicted values were within a factor of three of the corresponding literature values obtained under in vivo and in vitro conditions. for predicted and experimental p(t:p), linear relationships (r > 0.9 in most cases) were observed between muscle and other tissues, suggesting that p(t:p) of muscle is a good predictor for the p(t:p) of other tissues. the two previous equations could explain the mechanistic basis of these linear relationships. the practical aim of this study is a worthwhile goal for pharmacokinetic screening of new drug candidates.
modeling metabolic adjustment in mycobacterium tuberculosis upon treatment with isoniazid the manner in which microorganisms utilize their metabolic processes can be predicted using constraint-based analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks. herein, we present the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis toolbox, a software package running in the matlab environment, which allows for quantitative prediction of cellular behavior using a constraint-based approach. specifically, this software allows predictive computations of both steady-state and dynamic optimal growth behavior, the effects of gene deletions, comprehensive robustness analyses, sampling the range of possible cellular metabolic states and the determination of network modules. functions enabling these calculations are included in the toolbox, allowing a user to input a genome-scale metabolic model distributed in systems biology markup language format and perform these calculations with just a few lines of code. the results are predictions of cellular behavior that have been verified as accurate in a growing body of research. after software installation, calculation time is minimal, allowing the user to focus on the interpretation of the computational results.
monetary interventions in crowdsourcing task switching the task-switching paradigm offers enormous possibilities to study cognitive control as well as task interference. the current review provides an overview of recent research on both topics. first, we review different experimental approaches to task switching, such as comparing mixed-task blocks with single-task blocks, predictable task-switching and task-cuing paradigms, intermittent instructions, and voluntary task selection. in the 2nd part, we discuss findings on preparatory control mechanisms in task switching and theoretical accounts of task preparation. we consider preparation processes in two-stage models, consider preparation as an all-or-none process, address the question of whether preparation is switch-specific, reflect on preparation as interaction of cue encoding and memory retrieval, and discuss the impact of verbal mediation on preparation. in the 3rd part, we turn to interference phenomena in task switching. we consider proactive interference of tasks and inhibition of recently performed tasks indicated by asymmetrical switch costs and n-2 task-repetition costs. we discuss stimulus-based interference as a result of stimulus-based response activation and stimulus-based task activation, and response-based interference because of applying bivalent rather than univalent responses, response repetition effects, and carryover of response selection and execution. in the 4th and final part, we mention possible future research fields.
plant selection for nest building by western lowland gorillas in cameroon this paper provides a botanical inventory of a forest community in the north negros forest reserve that is disproportionately valuable from a conservation perspective. the forest fragment is one of the last remaining wet tropical rainforest ecosystems in the biogeographic region of the west visayas and an important refuge for a large number of endemic species. using standard methods of the philippine plant inventory project we described the structure and composition of this little known forest type in the transition zone between lowland and lower montane forest. a 1 ha inventory plot 500 × 20 m in size was established and all trees of 10 cm dbh or greater were measured and permanently labeled. subsequently, fertile specimens were collected over a period of 18 months. we found 645 individuals belonging to 92 species, 54 genera and 39 families with a combined basal area of 58.8 m2 and an average canopy height of 30 m. this community was not dominated by dipterocarps. species of lauraceae, burseraceae, sapotaceae and icainaceae were equally or more important. diversity measured as shannon–wiener index (5.59), equitability index (0.86) and simpson index (0.032) was high, and no single family or species dominated the plot.
clinical and cost effectiveness of apixaban compared to aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation: an australian perspective objective to determine the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (af) with a moderate to severe risk of stroke, from an australian government-perspective. methods a decision-analytic markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin, based on data from the apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in af (aristotle) trial. the model comprised five health states: ‘alive, no major bleeding or stroke’, ‘alive, no major bleeding, post stroke/systemic embolism’, ‘alive, post major bleeding, no stroke’, ‘alive, post-major bleeding and stroke’ and ‘dead’. disease cost data was derived from the north-east melbourne stroke incidence study and the australian refined diagnose related groups. costs of medications were based on data from the pharmaceutical benefit scheme. utility data was derived from published sources, and an annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. the main outcome of interest was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per life year gained (lyg) and quality adjusted life years (qalys) gained. results over 20 years, in the sample of 1000 subjects the model predicted that compared to warfarin, apixaban led to a (discounted) of 0.33 lyg and 0.31 qalys gained, at a net cost of $4,308 per-person. these equated to icers of $aud12, 914 per lyg and $aud13, 679 per qaly gained. probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that apixaban was cost-effective at 99.0% probability using willingness to pay thresholds of $aud45 000 per lyg and qaly. conclusion compared to warfarin, apixaban is likely to represent a cost-effective means of preventing stroke-related morbidity and mortality in patients with af.
performance evaluation of multiple target tracking in the absence of reference data the robust and reliable detection of objects in the path of a vehicle is an important prerequisite for collision avoidance and collision mitigation systems. in this paper, an ego-motion compensated tracking approach is presented which combines radar observations with the results of a contour-based image processing algorithm. the approach is able to handle all uncertainties of the system in a unified way without analytical linearization by using the unscented transform. by that, the covariances of the system can be estimated more accurately. the paper describes both the image processing and the state estimation algorithms. furthermore, results of several practical tests are presented.
multivariate time–frequency analysis of electromagnetic brain activity during bimanual motor learning this paper introduces a new tool for functional neuroimage analysis: partial least squares (pls). it is unique as a multivariate method in its choice of emphasis for analysis, that being the covariance between brain images and exogenous blocks representing either the experiment design or some behavioral measure. what emerges are spatial patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association between the images and either of the blocks. this process differs substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels, pls attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task or behavior. data from a face encoding and recognition pet rcbf study are used to illustrate two types of pls analysis: an activation analysis of task with images and a brain-behavior analysis. the commonalities across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. pls thus serves as an important extension by extracting new information from imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.
vagal activity is quadratically related to prosocial traits, prosocial emotions, and observer perceptions of prosociality. this paper focuses on pragmatic issues in obtaining measures of cardiac vagal control, and overviews a set of freely available software tools for obtaining several widely used metrics that putatively reflect sympathetic and/or parasympathetic contributions to cardiac chronotropy. after an overview of those metrics, and a discussion of potential confounds and extraneous influences, an empirical examination of the relationships amongst these metrics is provided. this study examined 10 metrics in 96 unselected college students under conditions of resting baseline and serial paced arithmetic. intercorrelations between metrics were very high. factor analyses were conducted on the metrics reflecting variability in cardiac rate, once at baseline and again during mental arithmetic. factor structure was highly stable across tasks, and included a factor that had high loadings of all variables except toichi's "cardiac sympathetic index" (csi), and a second factor that was defined predominantly by the csi. although generally highly correlated, the various metrics responded differently under challenge.
rb/plk1-dependent induced pathway by slamf3 expression inhibits mitosis and control hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation sap (signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (slam)-associated protein) is a t- and natural killer (nk)-cell-specific protein containing a single sh2 domain encoded by a gene that is defective or absent in patients with x-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (xlp). the sh2 domain of sap binds with high affinity to the cytoplasmic tail of the haematopoietic cell-surface glycoprotein slam and five related receptors. sap regulates signal transduction of the slam-family receptors by recruiting src kinases. similarly, the sap-related proteins eat2a and eat2b are thought to control signal transduction that is initiated by slam-related receptors in professional antigen-presenting cells. in this review, we discuss recent findings on the structure and function of proteins of the sap and slam families.
testing measurement invariance of the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system pain behaviors score between the us general population sample and a sample of individuals with chronic pain this study investigated parameter recovery for the partial credit model using the multilog computer program. factors studied were the sample size and the number of item parameters, which were manipulated by systematically varying the number of steps per item and the number of items. the findings suggest that the ratio of sample size to number of item parameters being estimated as a "rule of thumb" can be a more complete guideline when the number of steps per item is taken into account. accurate estimation of ability can be obtained across all conditions, even with sample sizes as small as 250. with regard to estimation of step values, however, more caution is warranted. accurate estimation of the step values of items which have more categories requires larger sample sizes for a given number of total parameters to be estimated.
noninferiority trial designs for odds ratios and risk differences. background in the setting of percutaneous coronary revascularization, agents in the class known as platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors have significantly reduced the incidence of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days. we assessed whether there are differences in safety or efficacy between two such inhibitors, tirofiban and abciximab.   methods using a double-blind, double-dummy design at 149 hospitals in 18 countries, we randomly assigned patients to receive either tirofiban or abciximab before undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization with the intent to perform stenting. the primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or urgent target-vessel revascularization at 30 days. the trial was designed and statistically powered to demonstrate the noninferiority of tirofiban as compared with abciximab.   results the primary end point occurred more frequently among the 2398 patients in the tirofiban group than among the 2411 patients in the abciximab group (7.6 percent vs. 6.0 percent; hazard ratio, 1.26; one-sided 95 percent confidence interval of 1.51, demonstrating lack of equivalence, and two-sided 95 percent confidence interval of 1.01 to 1.57, demonstrating the superiority of abciximab over tirofiban; p=0.038). the magnitude and the direction of the effect were similar for each component of the composite end point (hazard ratio for death, 1.21; hazard ratio for myocardial infarction, 1.27; and hazard ratio for urgent target-vessel revascularization, 1.26), and the difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction between the tirofiban group and the abciximab group was significant (6.9 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively; p=0.04). the relative benefit of abciximab was consistent regardless of age, sex, the presence or absence of diabetes, or the presence or absence of pretreatment with clopidogrel. there were no significant differences in the rates of major bleeding complications or transfusions, but tirofiban was associated with a lower rate of minor bleeding episodes and thrombocytopenia.   conclusions although the trial was intended to assess the noninferiority of tirofiban as compared with abciximab, the findings demonstrated that tirofiban offered less protection from major ischemic events than did abciximab.
instance selection for class imbalanced problems by means of selecting instances more than once evolutionary algorithms are adaptive methods based on natural evolution that may be used for search and optimization. as data reduction in knowledge discovery in databases (kdds) can be viewed as a search problem, it could be solved using evolutionary algorithms (eas). in this paper, we have carried out an empirical study of the performance of four representative ea models in which we have taken into account two different instance selection perspectives, the prototype selection and the training set selection for data reduction in kdd. this paper includes a comparison between these algorithms and other nonevolutionary instance selection algorithms. the results show that the evolutionary instance selection algorithms consistently outperform the nonevolutionary ones, the main advantages being: better instance reduction rates, higher classification accuracy, and models that are easier to interpret.
reproducibility of kinetics of electromyogram spectrum parameters during dynamic exercise spectral electromyographic (emg) changes in human quadriceps muscles were studied to reinvestigate discrepant results concerning mean power frequency (mpf) changes during dynamic exercise. an incremental test consisting of a quasi-linear increase in mechanical power on a bicycle ergometer (for 20-100% of maximal aerobic power) was performed by forty subjects. during this test, surface emgs from the quadriceps muscles showed that emg total power (pemg) increased with a curvilinear pattern for every subject, whereas mpf kinetics varied from one subject to another. pemg changes had the same shape, which would lead to disappointing results in terms of discrimination between subjects. the ability of normalized mpf kinetics to define significant clusters of subjects was tested using a principal component analysis. this analysis led to the projection of all experiments onto a plane and revealed a relevant grouping of mpf profiles. differences in mpf kinetics between clusters are interpreted in terms of various possibilities of balance between physiological events leading to an increase or a decrease in mpf.
female mating preferences determine system-level evolution in a gene network model most species maintain abundant genetic variation and experience a range of environmental conditions, yet phenotypic variation is low. that is, development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. it has been claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. we show that the developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. the extent of canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. we argue that canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex developmental–genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.
a portable library to support the sbml layout extension we present a modification of the spring‐embedder model of eades [congressus numerantium, 42, 149–160, (1984)] for drawing undirected graphs with straight edges. our heuristic strives for uniform edge lengths, and we develop it in analogy to forces in natural systems, for a simple, elegant, conceptually‐intuitive, and efficient algorithm.
extending the simultaneous-sequential paradigm to measure perceptual capacity for features and words. the psychophysics toolbox is a software package that supports visual psychophysics. its routines provide an interface between a high-level interpreted language (matlab on the macintosh) and the video display hardware. a set of example programs is included with the toolbox distribution.
mace: a new interface for comparing and editing of multiple alternative documents for generative design visualizing network data, from tree structures to arbitrarily connected graphs, is a difficult problem in information visualization. a large part of the problem is that in network data, users not only have to visualize the attributes specific to each data item, but also the links specifying how those items are connected to each other. past approaches to resolving these difficulties focus on zooming, clustering, filtering and applying various methods of laying out nodes and edges. such approaches, however, focus only on optimizing a network visualization in a single view, limiting the amount of information that can be shown and explored in parallel. moreover, past approaches do not allow users to cross reference different subsets or aspects of large, complex networks. in this paper, we propose an approach to these limitations using multiple coordinated views of a given network. to illustrate our approach, we implement a tool called dualnet and evaluate the tool with a case study using an email communication network. we show how using multiple coordinated views improves navigation and provides insight into large networks with multiple node and link properties and types.
the mrna-bound proteome of the early fly embryo. protein-rna interactions are fundamental to core biological processes, such as mrna splicing, localization, degradation, and translation. we developed a photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced uv crosslinking and oligo(dt) purification approach to identify the mrna-bound proteome using quantitative proteomics and to display the protein occupancy on mrna transcripts by next-generation sequencing. application to a human embryonic kidney cell line identified close to 800 proteins. to our knowledge, nearly one-third were not previously annotated as rna binding, and about 15% were not predictable by computational methods to interact with rna. protein occupancy profiling provides a transcriptome-wide catalog of potential cis-regulatory regions on mammalian mrnas and showed that large stretches in 3' utrs can be contacted by the mrna-bound proteome, with numerous putative binding sites in regions harboring disease-associated nucleotide polymorphisms. our observations indicate the presence of a large number of mrna binders with diverse molecular functions participating in combinatorial posttranscriptional gene-expression networks.
less might be more: conduction failure as a factor possibly limiting the efficacy of higher frequencies in rtms protocols background repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) has been developed as a novel tool for improving depression by delivering magnetic stimulation to the brain. however, the apparent effects of rtms on depression have been varied in different studies. the aims of this study were to determine whether left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rtms can alleviate medication-resistant depression in chinese patients and to investigate what demographic variables or clinical features may predict better response.   method we designed a 2-week randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study of add-on rtms. a total of 30 medication-resistant patients with dsm-iv major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, depressed episode completed 10 sessions of active or sham rtms-10 patients at each of 2 frequencies, faster (20 hz) or slower (5 hz) at 100% motor threshold, and 10 patients at sham stimulation.   results patients at both stimulation frequencies demonstrated a superior reduction of depression severity compared to sham stimulation (active = 55.7% vs. sham = 16.3%). the response rate for active rtms was 60%, in contrast to 10% for the sham treatment. no difference in clinical response was observed between 5 hz and 20 hz active rtms. clinical variables showed that younger age and less severe depression at entry may predict the clinical response to rtms. except for 1 patient in which rtms appeared to induce mania, this procedure posed no safety problem.   conclusions to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of rtms in chinese patients. since not all the rtms trials in previous reports had positive results, further larger trials are still warranted.
polymorphism of the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (tph2) gene is associated with chimpanzee neuroticism we tested whether the cultural background of raters influenced ratings of chimpanzee personality. our study involved comparing personality and subjective well‐being ratings of 146 chimpanzees in japan that were housed in zoos, research institutes, and a retirement sanctuary to ratings of chimpanzees in us and australian zoos. personality ratings were made on a translated and expanded version of a questionnaire used to rate chimpanzees in the us and australia. subjective well‐being ratings were made on a translated version of a questionnaire used to rate chimpanzees in the us and australia. the mean interrater reliabilities of the 43 original adjectives did not markedly differ between the present sample and the original sample of 100 zoo chimpanzees in the us. interrater reliabilities of these samples were highly correlated, suggesting that their rank order was preserved. comparison of the factor structures for the japanese sample and for the original sample of chimpanzees in us zoos indicated that the overall structure was replicated and that the dominance, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness domains clearly generalized. consistent with earlier studies, older chimpanzees had higher dominance and lower extraversion and openness scores. correlations between the six domain scores and subjective well‐being were comparable to those for chimpanzees housed in the us and australia. these findings suggest that chimpanzee personality ratings are not affected by the culture of the raters. am. j. primatol. 71:283–292, 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
the interaction between subclinical psychotic experiences, insomnia and objective measures of sleep summary the common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (fwer). this approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. a different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. it calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. this error rate is equivalent to the fwer when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the fwer is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. a simple sequential bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. the use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.
a novel classification technique of arteriovenous fistula stenosis evaluation using bilateral ppg analysis multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k > 2 values (i.e., k "classes"). the definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form (xi, f(xi)). existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms c4.5 and cart, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. this paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. we show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both c4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. we also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. finally, we show that--like the other methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems.
stress cardiomyopathy: is it limited to takotsubo syndrome? problems of definition. background a proposed etiology of apical ballooning syndrome (abs) is a spontaneously aborted anterior myocardial infarction (mi) in patients with a long "wrap around" left anterior descending artery (lad) rather than it being a unique cardiomyopathy. the aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with abs have a higher frequency of "wrap around" lad.   methods a retrospective analysis of the coronary anatomy and presence of coronary artery disease (cad) by angiography was performed among 97 abs patients, and compared to a matched control group with anterior st-elevation mi. lad length was graded: type 1--does not supply the left ventricular (lv) apex, type 2--the lad and right coronary both supply the apex, type 3--supplies the entire apex, and type 4--supplies the apex and >25% of the inferior wall (wrap around).   results abs patients had lower ejection fractions at presentation (41% ± 14% vs 47% ± 13%, p=0.001). there was no difference in the frequency of the 4 types of lad between abs (7%, 11%, 55%, 27%) and controls (3%, 13%, 51%, 33%), p=0.45. in abs, there was no difference in the mean lv ejection fraction (32.7%, 38.8%, 42.9%, 41.1%, respectively, p=0.39), or wall motion score index at presentation in the 4 lad groups. the prevalence of angiographic cad in abs was 84%.   conclusions abs patients do not have a higher frequency of "wrap around" lad. this fact, together with a greater magnitude of lv dysfunction at presentation, supports that cardiomyopathy is not due to spontaneously aborted anterior mi.
quantitative and functional interrogation of parent-of-origin allelic expression biases in the brain we present a novel pipeline and methodology for simultaneously estimating isoform expression and allelic imbalance in diploid organisms using rna-seq data. we achieve this by modeling the expression of haplotype-specific isoforms. if unknown, the two parental isoform sequences can be individually reconstructed. a new statistical method, mmseq, deconvolves the mapping of reads to multiple transcripts (isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms). our software can take into account non-uniform read generation and works with paired-end reads.

metallic copper corrosion rates, moisture content, and growth medium influence survival of copper ion-resistant bacteria copper is an essential component of life because of its convenient redox potential of 200-800 mv when bound to protein. extensive insight into copper homeostasis has only emerged in the last decade and enterococcus hirae has served as a paradigm for many aspects of the process. the cop operon of e. hirae regulates copper uptake, availability, and export. it consists of four genes that encode a repressor, copy, a copper chaperone, copz, and two cpx-type copper atpases, copa and copb. most of these components have been conserved across the three evolutionary kingdoms. the four cop proteins have been studied in vivo as well as in vitro and their function is understood in some detail.
total laboratory automation and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry improve turnaround times in the clinical microbiology laboratory: a retrospective analysis abstract gram-negative bacteremia is highly fatal, and hospitalizations due to sepsis have been increasing worldwide. molecular tests that supplement gram stain results from positive blood cultures provide specific organism information to potentially guide therapy, but more clinical data on their real-world impact are still needed. we retrospectively reviewed cases of gram-negative bacteremia in hospitalized patients over a 6-month period before (n = 98) and over a 6-month period after (n = 97) the implementation of a microarray-based early identification and resistance marker detection system (verigene bc-gn; nanosphere) while antimicrobial stewardship practices remained constant. patient demographics, time to organism identification, time to effective antimicrobial therapy, and other key clinical parameters were compared. the two groups did not differ statistically with regard to comorbid conditions, sources of bacteremia, or numbers of intensive care unit (icu) admissions, active use of immunosuppressive therapy, neutropenia, or bacteremia due to multidrug-resistant organisms. the bc-gn panel yielded an identification in 87% of gram-negative cultures and was accurate in 95/97 (98%) of the cases compared to results using conventional culture. organism identifications were achieved more quickly post-microarray implementation (mean, 10.9 h versus 37.9 h; p < 0.001). length of icu stay, 30-day mortality, and mortality associated with multidrug-resistant organisms were significantly lower in the postintervention group (p < 0.05). more rapid implementation of effective therapy was statistically significant for postintervention cases of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms (p = 0.049) but not overall (p = 0.12). the verigene bc-gn assay is a valuable addition for the early identification of gram-negative organisms that cause bloodstream infections and can significantly impact patient care, particularly when resistance markers are detected.
mapping the rna-seq trash bin the sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. these modifications are incorporated into a new program, clustal w which is freely available.
direction of arrival estimation based on subband weighting for noisy conditions a method is proposed that provides an approximation of the acoustic energy decay (energy-time curve) in room impulse responses generated using the image-source technique. a geometrical analysis of the image-source principle leads to a closed-form expression describing the energy decay curve, with the resulting formula being valid for a uniform as well as nonuniform definition of the enclosure's six absorption coefficients. the accuracy of the proposed approximation is demonstrated on the basis of impulse-response simulations involving various room sizes and reverberation levels, with uniform and nonuniform sound absorption coefficients. an application example for the proposed method is illustrated by considering the task of predicting an enclosure's reflection coefficients in order to achieve a specific reverberation level. the technique presented in this work enables designers to undertake a preliminary analysis of a simulated reverberant environment without the need for time-consuming image-method simulations.
cross-cousin marriage among the yanomamö shows evidence of parent–offspring conflict and mate competition between brothers to date there have been few empirical comparisons between alternative methods for measuring reproductive success (rs). we consider the pros and cons of alternative measures of rs to provide guidance for the design of field studies in human behavioral ecology. we compare cross‐sectional measures that count offspring alive at the time of the interview and retrospective measures that require data on offspring age at death or censoring. we consider analyses that include adult women (yielding age‐specific estimates of rs) as well as analyses restricted to postreproductive women (yielding data on lifetime rs). these methods are applied to reproductive data for the dogon of mali, west africa. am. j. hum. biol. 15:361–369, 2003. © 2003 wiley‐liss, inc.
dgca: a comprehensive r package for differential gene correlation analysis unlabelled r/ebcoexpress implements the approach of dawson and kendziorski using r, a freely available, open source statistical programming language. the approach identifies differential co-expression (dc) by examining the correlations among gene pairs using an empirical bayesian approach, producing a false discovery rate controlled list of dc pairs. this interrogation of dc gene pairs complements but is distinct from differential expression analyses, under the general goal of understanding differential regulation across biological conditions.   availability and implementation r/ebcoexpress is freely available and hosted on bioconductor; a source file and vignette may be found at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ebcoexpress.html
regulation of ldh expression during biotin-limited growth of corynebacterium glutamicum. in a recent proteomics study we have shown that the mcbr gene of corynebacterium glutamicum atcc 13032 most probably encodes a transcriptional repressor of the tetr type, which regulates the expression of at least six genes involved in the synthesis of sulphur‐containing amino acids. by means of dna microarray hybridizations we detected 86 genes with enhanced transcription in an mcbr mutant when compared with the wild‐type strain. bioinformatic analysis identified the inverted repeat 5′‐tagac‐n6‐gtcta‐3′ as a consensus sequence within the upstream region of 22 genes and operons, suggesting that the transcription of at least 45  genes is directly controlled by the mcbr repressor. these 45 genes encode a variety of functions in  (s‐adenosyl)methionine  and  cysteine  biosynthesis, in sulphate reduction, in uptake and utilization of sulphur‐containing  compounds  and  in  transcriptional regulation. the function of the inverted repeat motif as potential mcbr binding site in front of the genes hom, cysi, cysk, metk and mcbr was verified experimentally by competitive electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. a systematic search for the potential effector substance modulating the function of mcbr revealed that only s‐adenosylhomocysteine prevented the binding of mcbr to its target sequence. these results indicate that the transcriptional repressor mcbr directly regulates a set of genes comprising all aspects of transport and metabolism of the macroelement sulphur in c. glutamicum. as the activity of mcbr is modulated by s‐adenosylhomocysteine, a major product of transmethylation reactions, the results point also to a novel regulatory mechanism in bacteria to control the biosynthesis of s‐adenosylmethionine.
mobile supply chain management: moving where? an understanding of culture is important to the study of information technologies in that culture at various levels, including national, organizational, and group, can influence the successful implementation and use of information technology. culture also plays a role in managerial processes that may directly, or indirectly, influence it. culture is a challenging variable to research, in part because of the multiple divergent definitions and measures of culture. notwithstanding, a wide body of literature has emerged that sheds light on the relationship of it and culture. this paper sets out to provide a review of this literature in order to lend insights into our understanding of the linkages between it and culture. we begin by conceptualizing culture and laying the groundwork for a values-based approach to the examination of it and culture. using this approach, we then provide a comprehensive review of the organizational and cross-cultural it literature that conceptually links these two traditionally separate streams of research. from our analysis, we develop six themes of it-culture research emphasizing culture's impact on it, it's impact on culture, and it culture. building upon these themes, we then develop a theory of it, values, and conflict. based upon the theory, we develop propositions concerning three types of cultural conflict and the results of these conflicts. ultimately, the theory suggests that the reconciliation of these conflicts results in a reorientation of values. we conclude with the particular research challenges posed in this line of inquiry.
persistent beneficial impact of h-reflex conditioning in spinal cord-injured rats. operant conditioning of the spinal stretch reflex or its electrical analog, the h-reflex, is a new model for exploring the mechanisms of long-term supraspinal control over spinal cord function. primates and rats can gradually increase (hrup conditioning mode) or decrease (hrdown conditioning mode) the h-reflex when reward is based on h-reflex amplitude. an earlier study indicated that hrdown conditioning of the soleus h-reflex in rats is impaired following contusion injury to thoracic spinal cord. the extent of impairment was correlated with the percent of white matter lost at the injury site. the present study investigated the effects of spinal cord injury on hrup conditioning. soleus h-reflexes were elicited and recorded with chronically implanted electrodes from 14 rats that had been subjected to calibrated contusion injuries to the spinal cord at t8. at the lesion epicenter, 12-39% of the white matter remained. after control-mode data were collected, each rat was exposed to the hrup conditioning mode for 50 days. final h-reflex amplitudes after hrup conditioning averaged 112% (+/-22% sd) of control. this value was significantly smaller than that for 13 normal rats exposed to hrup conditioning, in which final amplitude averaged 153% (+/-51%) sd of control. as previously reported for hrdown conditioning after spinal cord injury, success was inversely correlated with the severity of the injury as assessed by white matter preservation and by time to return of bladder function. hrup and hrdown conditioning are similarly sensitive to injury. these results further demonstrate that h-reflex conditioning is a sensitive measure of the long-term effects of injury on supraspinal control over spinal cord functions and could prove a valuable measure of therapeutic efficacy.
valuing and sustaining (or not) the ability of volunteer community health workers to deliver integrated community case management in northern ghana: a qualitative study this is the first in a series of three articles   in the past decade, qualitative methods have become more commonplace in areas such as health services research and health technology assessment, and there has been a corresponding rise in the reporting of qualitative research studies in medical and related journals.1 interest in these methods and their wider exposure in health research has led to necessary scrutiny of qualitative research. researchers from other traditions are increasingly concerned to understand qualitative methods and, most importantly, to examine the claims researchers make about the findings obtained from these methods.  the status of all forms of research depends on the quality of the methods used. in qualitative research, concern about assessing quality has manifested itself recently in the proliferation of guidelines for doing and judging qualitative work.2–5 users and funders of research have had an important role in developing these guidelines as they become increasingly familiar with qualitative methods, but require some means of assessing their quality and of distinguishing “good” and “poor” quality research. however, the issue of “quality” in qualitative research is part of a much larger and contested debate about the nature of the knowledge produced by qualitative research, whether its quality can legitimately be judged, and, if so, how. this paper cannot do full justice to this wider epistemological debate. rather it outlines two views of how qualitative methods might be judged and argues that qualitative research can be assessed according to two broad criteria: validity and relevance.  #### summary points  qualitative methods are now widely used and increasingly accepted in health research, but quality in qualitative research is a mystery to many health services researchers  there is considerable debate over the nature of the knowledge produced by such methods and how such research should be judged  antirealists argue …
capacity and ser analysis of mimo beamforming with mrc previous work on space-time coding has been restricted to the idealistic case of uncorrelated spatial fading. in practice, however insufficient antenna spacing or lack of scattering cause the individual antennas to be correlated. in this paper we study the impact of spatial fading correlation on the performance of space-time codes. in particular we quantify the loss in diversity gain and coding gain as a function of angle spread and antenna spacing. we furthermore show that if a space-time code achieves full diversity in the uncorrelated case, the diversity order achieved in the correlated case is given by the product of the rank of the transmit correlation matrix and the rank of the receive correlation matrix. finally, we provide simulation results demonstrating the impact of spatial fading correlation on the symbol error rate of space-time codes.
integrating dnn-based and spatial clustering-based mask estimation for robust mvdr beamforming we present results obtained with several advanced language modeling techniques, including class based model, cache model, maximum entropy model, structured language model, random forest language model and several types of neural network based language models. we show results obtained after combining all these models by using linear interpolation. we conclude that for both small and moderately sized tasks, we obtain new state of the art results with combination of models, that is significantly better than performance of any individual model. obtained perplexity reductions against good-turing trigram baseline are over 50% and against modified kneser-ney smoothed 5-gram over 40%.
the six metal binding domains in human copper transporter, atp7b: molecular biophysics and disease-causing mutations backgroundwilson﻿'s disease ﻿with﻿ osseomuscular type is a rare condition, which often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and causes misdiagnoses easily. during the past 10 years, eight chinese patients of osseomuscular type of wilson's disease were identified in our clinic.methodsclinical information was gathered from medical records and follow-ups. the genetic testing was performed in each patient. serum ceruloplasmin, kayser-fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated.resultsthe median age of onset is 12 years of age. the patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurologic signs were minimal. most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms afterwards with a median interval of 36 months. all of them had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/l). most patients (6/8) present with kayser-fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. the arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy.conclusionswilson’s disease with osseomuscular type occurs without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes the clinical diagnosis challenging. serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic testing help to establish the diagnosis. early diagnosis can initiate an effective treatment and prevent the further damage.
improving classification models when a class hierarchy is available markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. a markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal “slice” defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. such “slice sampling” methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. this approach is often easier to implement than gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. it is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. these methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. more ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. this can be done for univariate slice sampling by “overrelaxation,” and for multivariate slice sampling by “reflection” from the edges of the slice.
is there an added value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in sarcoidosis patients? lung volumes are subdivided into static and dynamic lung volumes. static lung volumes are measured by methods which are based on the completeness of respiratory manoeuvres, so that the velocity of the manoeuvres should be adjusted accordingly. the measurements taken during fast breathing movements are described as dynamic lung volumes and as forced inspiratory and expiratory flows.  ### 1.1 static lung volumes and capacities  the volume of gas in the lung and intrathoracic airways is determined by the properties of lung parenchyma and surrounding organs and tissues, surface tension, the force exerted by respiratory muscles, by lung reflexes and by the properties of airways. the gas volumes of thorax and lung are the same except in the case of a pneumothorax. if two or more subdivisions of the total lung capacity are taken together, the sum of the constituent volumes is described as a lung capacity. lung volumes and capacities are described in more detail in § 2.  #### 1.1.1 determinants  factors which determine the size of the normal lung include stature, age, sex, body mass, posture, habitus, ethnic group, reflex factors and daily activity pattern. the level of maximal inspiration (total lung capacity, tlc) is influenced by the force developed by the inspiratory muscles (disorders include e.g. muscular dystrophy), the elastic recoil of the lung (disorders include e.g. pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema) and the elastic properties of the thorax and adjacent structures (disorders include e.g. ankylosis of joints). the level of maximal expiration (residual volume, rv) is determined by the force exerted by respiratory muscles (disorders include e.g. muscle paralysis), obstruction, occlusion and compression of small airways (disorders include e.g. emphysema) and by the mechanical properties of lung and thorax (disorders include diffuse fibrosis, kyphoscoliosis).  assessing the total lung capacity is indispensable in establishing a restrictive ventilatory defect or in diagnosing abnormal lung distensibility, as may occur in patients …
behavior and modeling of two-dimensional precedence effect in head-unrestrained cats. using the magnetic search coil technique to measure eye and ear movements, we trained cats by operant conditioning to look in the direction of light and sound sources with their heads fixed. cats were able to localize noise bursts, single clicks, or click trains presented from sources located on the horizontal and vertical meridians within their oculomotor range. saccades to auditory targets were less accurate and more variable than saccades to visual targets at the same spatial positions. localization accuracy of single clicks was diminished compared with the long-duration stimuli presented from the same sources. control experiments with novel auditory targets, never associated with visual targets, demonstrated that the cats localized the sound sources using acoustic cues and not from memory. the role of spectral features imposed by the pinna for vertical sound localization was shown by the breakdown in localization of narrow-band (one-sixth of an octave) noise bursts presented from sources along the midsagittal plane. in addition, we show that cats experience summing localization, an illusion associated with the precedence effect. pairs of clicks presented from speakers at (±18°,0°) with interclick delays of ±300 μsec were perceived by the cat as originating from phantom sources extending from the midline to approximately ±10°.
diverse cortical codes for scene segmentation in primate auditory cortex. in many animals, the information most important for processing communication sounds, including speech, consists of temporal envelope cues below approximately 20 hz. physiological studies, however, have typically emphasized the upper limits of modulation encoding. responses to sinusoidal am (sam) are generally summarized by modulation transfer functions (mtfs), which emphasize tuning to modulation frequency rather than the representation of the instantaneous stimulus amplitude. unfortunately, mtfs fail to capture important but nonlinear aspects of amplitude coding in the central auditory system. we focus on an alternative data representation, the modulation period histogram (mph), which depicts the spike train folded on the modulation period of the sam stimulus. at low modulation frequencies, the fluctuations of stimulus amplitude in decibels are robustly encoded by the cycle-by-cycle response dynamics evident in the mph. we show that all of the parameters that define a sam stimulus--carrier frequency, carrier level, modulation frequency, and modulation depth--are reflected in the shape of cortical mphs. in many neurons that are nonmonotonically tuned for sound amplitude, the representation of modulation frequency is typically sacrificed to preserve the mapping between the instantaneous discharge rate and the instantaneous stimulus amplitude, resulting in two response modes per modulation cycle. this behavior, as well as the relatively poor tuning of cortical mtfs, suggests that auditory cortical neurons are not well suited for operating as a "modulation filterbank." instead, our results suggest that <20 hz, the processing of modulated signals is better described as envelope shape discrimination rather than modulation frequency extraction.
genotyping by sequencing transcriptomes in an evolutionary pre-breeding durum wheat population we have mapped and quantified mouse transcriptomes by deeply sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is represented in the sequence sample (rna-seq). this provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. we report reference measurements composed of 41–52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(a)-selected rna from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. we used rna standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. although >90% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3′ untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microrna precursors. rna splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. we observed 1.45 × 105 distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.
understanding herg inhibition with qsar models based on a one-dimensional molecular representation during the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. with it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. the challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. this book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. while the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. it is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. the book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. the many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.  this major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. there is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.  trevor hastie, robert tibshirani, and jerome friedman are professors of statistics at stanford university. they are prominent researchers in this area: hastie and tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in r/s-plus and invented principal curves and surfaces. tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful an introduction to the bootstrap. friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including cart, mars, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.
electrostatic control of the overall shape of calmodulin: numerical calculations the protein data bank (pdb), at brookhaven national laboratory, is a database containing information on experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological macromolecules, with approximately 9000 entries. the pdb has a 27-year history of service to a global community of researchers, educators, and students in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. data are easily submitted via pdb's www-based tool autodep, in either pdb or mmcif format, and are most conveniently examined via pdb's www-based tool 3db browser. collaborative centers have been, and continue to be, established worldwide to assist in data deposition, archiving, and distribution.
obesity and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and barrett's esophagus: a mendelian randomization study. obesity is globally prevalent and highly heritable, but its underlying genetic factors remain largely elusive. to identify genetic loci for obesity susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index and approximately 2.8 million snps in up to 123,865 individuals with targeted follow up of 42 snps in up to 125,931 additional individuals. we confirmed 14 known obesity susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with body mass index (p < 5 x 10(-)(8)), one of which includes a copy number variant near gprc5b. some loci (at mc4r, pomc, sh2b1 and bdnf) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near gipr, an incretin receptor. furthermore, genes in other newly associated loci may provide new insights into human body weight regulation.
region-based correspondence between 3d shapes via spatially smooth biclustering the problem of mapping between two non‐isometric surfaces admits ambiguities on both local and global scales. for instance, symmetries can make it possible for multiple maps to be equally acceptable, and stretching, slippage, and compression introduce difficulties deciding exactly where each point should go. since most algorithms for point‐to‐point or even sparse mapping struggle to resolve these ambiguities, in this paper we introduce soft maps, a probabilistic relaxation of point‐to‐point correspondence that explicitly incorporates ambiguities in the mapping process. in addition to explaining a continuous theory of soft maps, we show how they can be represented using probability matrices and computed for given pairs of surfaces through a convex optimization explicitly trading off between continuity, conformity to geometric descriptors, and spread. given that our correspondences are encoded in matrix form, we also illustrate how low‐rank approximation and other linear algebraic tools can be used to analyze, simplify, and represent both individual and collections of soft maps.
k-means based histogram using multiresolution feature vectors for color texture database retrieval we present a statistical view of the texture retrieval problem by combining the two related tasks, namely feature extraction (fe) and similarity measurement (sm), into a joint modeling and classification scheme. we show that using a consistent estimator of texture model parameters for the fe step followed by computing the kullback-leibler distance (kld) between estimated models for the sm step is asymptotically optimal in term of retrieval error probability. the statistical scheme leads to a new wavelet-based texture retrieval method that is based on the accurate modeling of the marginal distribution of wavelet coefficients using generalized gaussian density (ggd) and on the existence a closed form for the kld between ggds. the proposed method provides greater accuracy and flexibility in capturing texture information, while its simplified form has a close resemblance with the existing methods which uses energy distribution in the frequency domain to identify textures. experimental results on a database of 640 texture images indicate that the new method significantly improves retrieval rates, e.g., from 65% to 77%, compared with traditional approaches, while it retains comparable levels of computational complexity.
determination of oxycodone and its major metabolites noroxycodone and oxymorphone by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in plasma and urine: application to real cases oxycodone is an opioid agonist largely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. variability in analgesic efficacy could be explained by inter-subject variations in plasma levels of parent drug and its active metabolite, oxymorphone. for this purpose it is necessary to develop and validate a sensitive and selective analytical method for the quantification of oxycodone and its major metabolites, noroxycodone and oxymorphone, in human plasma. the analytical method consisted of a liquid-liquid extraction procedure followed by a high performance liquid chromatography with heated assisted electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (hplc-hesi-ms/ms). the chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of ethanol and 10mm ammonium acetate on a synergi max-rp analytical column (150×2mm, 4μm) protected by a security guard cartridge (c12 4×2mm) at a flow rate of 300μl/min.the calibration functions are linear in the range of 300-50,000pg/ml for oxycodone and noroxycodone and 50 to 10 000pg/ml for oxymorphone. intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations are less than 5.5% and 6.4%, respectively for all analytes. the limit of detection was 30pg/ml for all analytes. we introduce a new hplc-hesi-ms/ms sensitive and specific analytical method capable to simultaneously quantify oxycodone, noroxycodone and oxymorphone, in human plasma, and suitable for the conduct of pharmacokinetic studies after a single dose administration of the parent compound.
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
spirulina promotes stem cell genesis and protects against lps induced declines in neural stem cell proliferation new hippocampal neurons are continuously generated in the adult brain. here, we demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, which gives rise to microglia activation in the area where the new neurons are born, strongly impairs basal hippocampal neurogenesis in rats. the increased neurogenesis triggered by a brain insult is also attenuated if it is associated with microglia activation caused by tissue damage or lipopolysaccharide infusion. the impaired neurogenesis in inflammation is restored by systemic administration of minocycline, which inhibits microglia activation. our data raise the possibility that suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis by activated microglia contributes to cognitive dysfunction in aging, dementia, epilepsy, and other conditions leading to brain inflammation.
activity of daily living is associated with circulating cd34+/kdr+ cells and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels in patients after myocardial infarction. the article provides a review of the role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) for mobilization and transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor and stem cells. recombinant gene technology has permitted the production of highly purified material for therapeutic use in humans. progenitor cells can be assessed using semisolid and liquid culture assays or direct immunofluorescence analysis of cells expressing cd34. this antigen is found on lineage-determined hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as on more primitive stem cells with extensive self-renewal capacity. administration of g-csf during steady-state hematopoiesis or following cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to an increase of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the peripheral blood. the level of circulating cd34+ cells post-chemotherapy is greater compared with g-csf administration during steady state. on the other hand, cd34+ cells harvested post-chemotherapy contain a smaller proportion of more primitive progenitor cells (cd34+/hla-dr- or cd34+/cd38-) compared with g-csf treatment alone. independent of the mobilization modality, the amount of previous cytotoxic chemo- and radiotherapy adversely affects the yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells. while continuous subcutaneous administration of g-csf between 5 and 16 micrograms/kg bodyweight is preferred, additional dose-finding studies may be helpful to optimize current dose schedules. adhesion molecules like l-selectin, vla (very late antigen)-4 and lfa (leukocyte function antigen)-1 are likely to play a role in mobilization, since these antigens are expressed on cd34+ cells from bone marrow in different densities compared with blood-derived cd34+ cells collected following g-csf-supported cytotoxic chemotherapy. it is also relevant for transplantation that during g-csf-enhanced recovery post-chemotherapy, peripheral blood is enriched with a greater proportion of cd34+ cells expressing thy-1 in comparison with cd34+ cells from bone marrow samples obtained on the same day or before the mobilization therapy was started. the early nature of the cd34+/thy-1+ cells is very likely since this phenotype has been found on stem cells from human fetal liver and bone marrow and on cord blood cells. as a result, g-csf-mobilized blood stem cells provide rapid and sustained engraftment following high-dose therapy, including myeloablative regimens. positive selection of cd34+ cells as well as ex vivo expansion using different cytokines are currently being investigated for purging and improvement of short-term recovery post-transplantation. future developments include the use of blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells for somatic gene therapy. the availability of growth factors has been an important prerequisite for the development of these new avenues for cell therapy.
risk stratification for patients in cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. although percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) in the setting of cardiogenic shock has a high in-hospital mortality rate, it has been shown to decrease the mortality rate in certain subgroups. the identity and relative importance of variables that are predictive of in-hospital mortality rate after pci for cardiogenic shock are uncertain. accordingly, we examined data of >300,000 patients in the american college of cardiology-national cardiovascular data registry (acc-ncdr) that were collected from 1998 to 2002 and evaluated the outcomes in 483 consecutive patients who underwent emergency pci for cardiogenic shock. patients' mean age was 65 +/- 13 years, with men predominating (61%). all underwent emergency/salvage pci in the setting of cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 30 +/- 16%. stents were placed in 64% of patients, and thrombolytic agents were administered in 26%. although pci was angiographically successful in 79% of patients, the in-hospital mortality rate was 59.4%. length of stay after pci was 7.2 +/- 8 days. logistic regression using all available variables identified 6 multivariate predictors of death: age (odds ratio [or] 2.34, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.68 to 3.28, p <0.001) for each 10-year increment, female gender (or 1.55, 95% ci 1.00 to 2.41, p <0.001), baseline renal insufficiency (creatinine >2.0 mg/dl; or 4.69, 95% ci 1.96 to 11.23, p <0.001), total occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (or 1.99, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 3.09, p <0.01), no stent used (or 2.55, 95% ci 1.63 to 3.96, p <0.01), and no glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor used during pci (or 1.96, 95% ci 1.30 to 2.98, p <0.01). in a second analysis using only variables known to the clinician at the time of initial presentation, gender, age, renal insufficiency, and total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery were significant. in conclusion, analysis of patients from the acc-ncdr who underwent emergency pci for acute myocardial infarction in the presence of cardiogenic shock shows an in-hospital mortality rate of approximately 60% when pci is attempted.
leadership in strategic information (lsi) building skilled public health capacity in ethiopia this article describes the effect of an online analytic skills training course on professional development and practice and discusses recommendations for using this training modality in the public health workforce. the enhancing data utilization skills through information technology initiative trained professionals in maternal and child health from 13 southern-tier state and local health departments to collect, analyze, and interpret data via a year-long web-based course. the evaluation of this initiative was based on a model of change for health professionals that holds that training influences behavior by increasing knowledge, influencing beliefs related to the behavior, enhancing self-efficacy, and improving skills. participants’ knowledge, beliefs, and self-efficacy all increased significantly during the course. participants’ self-assessed skill levels increased significantly for each of 12 selected skills and overall for all skills combined. distance learning is potentially an effective means for professionals to advance their skills while continuing to fulfill their work-related responsibilities.
metabolic profiling of central nervous system disease in trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection large-scale population phenotyping for molecular epidemiological studies is subject to all the usual criteria of analytical chemistry. as part of a major phenotyping investigation we have used high-resolution 1h nmr spectroscopy to characterize 24-h urine specimens obtained from population samples in aito town, japan (n = 259), chicago, il (n = 315), and guangxi, china (n = 278). we have investigated analytical reproducibility, urine specimen storage procedures, interinstrument variability, and split specimen detection. our data show that the multivariate analytical reproducibility of the nmr screening platform was >98% and that most classification errors were due to urine specimen handling inhomogeneity. differences in metabolite profiles were then assessed for aito town, chicago, and guangxi population samples; novel combinations of biomarkers were detected that separated the population samples. these cross-population differences in urinary metabolites could be related to genetic, dietary, and gut microbial factors.
author correction: hippocampal oxytocin receptors are necessary for discrimination of social stimuli social interactions in vertebrates are complex phenomena based on affective and cognitive processes. multiple brain regions and neurotransmitter systems are involved in the expression of social behaviors, but their individual roles in specific aspects of social interactions are not well understood. here we investigated how gq-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mglur5) and oxytocin receptor (oxtr) affect social affiliation and social memory. we used conditional genetic approaches in which the genes coding for these receptors were knocked out in the lateral septum by infusion of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors containing cre recombinase (aav-cre). social behavior was assessed 2 weeks later using a three-chamber paradigm for sociability and preference for social novelty. septal deletion of mglur5 abolished sociability while leaving preference for social novelty intact. in contrast, deletion of oxtr did not affect sociability but significantly impaired preference for social novelty. nonsocial behaviors or memories, including novel object recognition or fear conditioning, were not affected by these genetic manipulations. immunohistochemical analyses of the distribution of mglur5 and oxtr revealed non-overlapping localization of these receptors within the lateral septum, suggesting that not only different neurotransmitters but also different neuronal types contribute to sociability versus preference for social novelty. our findings identify highly specialized roles of lateral septal mglur5 and oxtr in the the regulation of discrete social behaviors, and suggest that deficits in social interactions, which accompany many mental illnesses, would benefit from comprehensive treatments targeting different components of social functioning.
the anticholinergic and antiglutamatergic drug caramiphen reduces seizure duration in soman-exposed rats: synergism with the benzodiazepine diazepam. cholinesterases (ches) are classified as acetylcholinesterase (ache) and butyrylcholinesterase (bche) according to their substrate specificity and sensitivity to selected inhibitors. the activities of ache in red blood cells (rbc-ache) and bche in serum can be used as potential biomarkers of suppressed and/or heightened activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems. exposure to organophosphate (op) chemical warfare agents (cwas), pesticides, anesthetics, and a variety of drugs such as cocaine, as well as some neurodegenerative and liver disease states, selectively reduces ache or bche activity. in humans, the toxicity of pesticides is well documented. therefore, blood cholinesterase activity can be exploited as a tool for confirming exposure to these agents and possible treatments. current assays for measurement of rbc-ache and serum bche require several labor-intensive processing steps, suffer from wide statistical variation, and there is no inter-laboratory conversion between methods. these methods, which determine only the serum bche or rbc-ache but not both, include the ellman, radiometric, and deltaph (modified michel) methods. in contrast, the walter reed army institute of research whole blood (wrair wb, us patent #6,746,850) cholinesterase assay rapidly determines the activity of both ache and bche in unprocessed (uncentrifuged) whole blood, uses a minimally invasive blood sampling technique (e.g., blood from a finger prick), and is semi-automated for high-throughput using the biomek 2000 robotic system. to date, the wrair whole blood assay was used to measure ache and bche activities in human blood from volunteers in fda clinical trials. in the first fda study, 24 human subjects were given either 30 mg pb orally (n = 19) or placebo (n = 5). blood samples were obtained pre-dosing and 2.5, 5, 8, and 24 h post-dosing. the samples were analyzed for ache and bche activity using the wrair wb robotic system, and for pb concentration by hplc. we found that maximal inhibition of ache (26.2%) and concentration of pb (17.1 ng/ml) occurred at 2.5 h post-pb dosing. ache activity returned to almost 100% of pre-dose values by 6 h. a dose-dependent linear correlation was found between the amount of pb measured in the blood and the inhibition of ache. following soman (gd) exposure, recovered ache activity was similar to levels that were reversibly protected by the pb administration. therefore, the wrair che wb data clearly supports the conclusion that pb is an effective pre-treatment drug for nerve agent exposure (gd). in the second fda human study for the treatment of alzheimer's disease, the wrair che wb assay was used to determine the rbc-ache and serum bche profile of healthy elderly volunteers receiving huperzine a. huperzine a is a plant-derived reversible and selective ache inhibitor compared to bche, and is a more potent inhibitor of ache than pb. huperzine a is available as a nutraceutical, a natural supplement reported to improve memory, and has a variety of neuroprotective effects. individuals received an increasing dose regimen of huperzine a (final dose 200 microg after 4 weeks), which produced more than 50% inhibition of rbc-ache. huperzine a was well tolerated by these patients at doses that sequestered more rbc-ache than pb, and thus warrants further study as a prophylaxis for op poisoning in addition to alzheimer's therapy. due to the documented use of ops by terrorists and in warfare around the globe, federal, state, and local authorities need a reliable, fast, inexpensive, and standard method for confirming such an assault in order to initiate appropriate containment, decontamination, and treatment measures. this assay is ideal for prescreening military personnel for atypical che activities that would preclude their deployment to areas of potential cwa exposure. the wrair wb che assay will fulfill the requirement for rapid and reliable monitoring of such exposure in military and civilian populations.
improving bias and coverage in instrumental variable analysis with weak instruments for continuous and binary outcomes. this paper derives and gives explicit formulas for a derived sandwich variance estimate. this variance estimate is appropriate for generalized linear additive measurement error models fitted using instrumental variables. we also generalize the known results for linear regression. as such, this article explains the theoretical justification for the sandwich estimate of variance utilized in the software for measurement error developed under the small business innovation research grant (sbir) by statacorp. the results admit estimation of variance matrices for measurement error models where there is an instrument for the unknown covariate. copyright 2003 by statacorp lp.
continuous monitoring in the dynamic sensor field model we introduce a formal model of computation for networks of tiny artifacts, the static synchronous sensor field model (sssf) which considers that the devices communicate through a fixed communication graph and interact with the environment through input/output data streams. we analyze the performance of sssfs solving two sensing problems the average monitoring and the alerting problems. for constant memory sssfs we show that the set of recognized languages is contained in dspace(n + m) where n is the number of nodes of the communication graph and m its number of edges. finally we explore the capabilities of sssfs having sensing and additional non-sensing constant memory devices.
projection-embedded byy learning algorithm for gaussian mixture-based clustering \ r=1 si by cyclically projecting onto the sets. the original alternating projection result was due to von neumann (1933) who was able to prove that if the sets are subspaces map converges in norm to p\ r=1si . using map a point in the intersection can be obtained when only the individual projection onto each of the sets are known. when the underlying sets are convex, map and its variants are fairly well understood. however, despite adequate theoretical justication, these techniques are routinely applied to problems involving one or more non-convex sets with good results. in this report we examine some of the diculties encountered when dropping the assumption of convexity. this is achieved by developing a visual tool to investigate specic examples using interactive geometry package cinderella [5].
improved insulin sensitivity, preserved beta cell function and improved whole-body glucose metabolism after low-dose growth hormone replacement therapy in adults with severe growth hormone deficiency: a pilot study context insulin interacts with the gh-igf system by a reciprocal regulation of igf-binding proteins (igfbp) and gh, which in turn regulate insulin sensitivity via bioactive igf-i. this network is linked to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases.   objective we evaluated the effect of glucose and insulin on igfbp-1-4, particularly igfbp-2, in the regulation of bioactive igf-i and its relation to insulin resistance.   setting the study was conducted at an endocrinology center.   research design and methods twenty-four healthy subjects (12 men; aged 21-72 yr; body mass index 25.9 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) and 19 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (igt; eight men; aged 26-71 yr; body mass index 28.9 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2)) were prospectively studied using oral glucose tolerance test and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.   results during the clamp, insulin decreased igf-i bioactivity in both igt subjects and controls (-16.2 +/- 2.8 and -13.9 +/- 3.3%, respectively; p < 0.01). in addition, insulin increased igfbp-2 and gh and decreased igfbp-1 and -4 but did not alter total igf-i, igf-ii, or igfbp-3 levels. during the oral glucose tolerance test, gh and igfbp-1 were markedly suppressed. subjects with igt showed more pronounced insulin resistance and lower gh, igfbp-1, and igfbp-2 levels (p < 0.05). in multiple regression analysis, igfbp-2 was an independent predictor of insulin sensitivity (beta = 0.36, p < 0.05) and igf-i bioactivity (beta = -0.5, p < 0.05).   conclusions our data indicate that insulin acutely decreases igf-i bioactivity through differential modulation of igfbps. furthermore, igfbp-2 plays a central role in the insulin-igf system cross talk and is closely linked to insulin resistance, thereby providing a further explanation for its association with the metabolic syndrome.
brain rhythms reveal a hierarchical network organization neuroanatomy places critical constraints on the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex. to analyze these constraints we have examined the relationship between structural features of networks (expressed as graphs) and the patterns of functional connectivity to which they give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. we selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity. we selected graphs separately for increases in measures of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements), integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity (capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and integration). we found that dynamics with high complexity were supported by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. connection matrices based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs, revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical groupings of areas. moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems, these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent functional clusters. we also found that selection of graphs as they responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity of their dynamics. we hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic of the cerebral cortex.
enhanced sensory perception in synaesthesia twenty-four subjects were studied before and up to 1 year after surgery that produced injury to a major sensory branch of the trigeminal nerve. we employed a battery of 11 psychophysical tests, in which the neural mechanisms underlying performance are understood, to study the basis of recovery following nerve injury. immediately after nerve injury, sensation was profoundly impaired in all subjects. in the following weeks and months, the recovery of performance proceeded in an orderly fashion. although the rates of recovery varied between subjects, the order of recovery between tasks did not. the recovery rates fell into three distinct categories. recovery in one task, brush-stroke directional discrimination, was most rapid. two weeks after nerve injury, 52% of subjects could discriminate brush-stroke direction; by 3 months only one subject could not perform this task. the second category comprised recovery rates for pain thresholds for noxious heat, cold and mechanical stimuli, and to preinjury performance in tasks assessing touch and vibration detection, two-point discrimination, cooling detection and subjective magnitude estimation of mechanical force. the third, slowest group included recovery rates for warming detection and grating orientation discrimination. early recovery to preinjury performance levels in the brush-stroke direction and one-point versus two-point discrimination tasks was correlated with later recovery to near normal performance in the grating orientation task. the grating orientation task was unique in providing a measure that corresponded consistently with the subjects' reports of sensory deficits. our psychophysical findings are consistent with neurophysiological data showing that the major primary afferent fibre classes reinnervate the skin at a similar rate. a hypothesis that accounts for the psychophysical findings in this study is that differences in recovery rates between tasks is determined largely by their relative dependencies on functional innervation density. alternative hypotheses are considered.
brief communication: identification reassessment of the isolated tooth krapina d58 through occlusal fingerprint analysis. information about food ingestion and mastication behavior during the lifespan of an individual is encoded in the dental occlusal wear pattern. to decode this information, we describe a new method called occlusal fingerprint analysis (ofa). structural parameters of wear facets on the occlusal surface of teeth are quantified from digitized casts for the interpretation of occlusal aspects. the ofa provides an individual three-dimensional dental occlusal compass that indicates the major pathways of interaction between antagonists, revealing information about development, spatial position, and enlargement of wear facets. humans develop a very similar overall pattern of crown contacts, although specific characteristics of wear facets reflect an individual's occlusal relationships and masticatory behavior. we hypothesize that the wear pattern is a unique character and therefore valuable for individual identification. furthermore we suggest that ofa, when further developed, may be useful for identification of behavioral, biological, and chemical factors affecting crown morphology.
symptomatic and functional outcome of bipolar disorder in butajira, ethiopia. the development of a series of instruments that has so far culminated in scan version 2.0 began in the late 1950s because of the need for better tools for clinical measurement (including categorization and diagnosis). the basis principles of the pse had long been decided by the time of first publication in 1974 and have remained the same since. based on the glossary of differential definitions, the aim is to provide comprehensive, accurate and technically specifiable means of describing and classifying clinical phenomena in order to make comparisons. insofar as it fulfils this aim, scan can be used to enhance clinical work and education and advance knowledge through its use in biomedical, epidemiological and psychosocial research.

a machine learning aproach for device-independent automated segmentation of retinal cysts in spectral domain optical cohorence tomography images purpose to evaluate the relative involvement of inner and outer retina in hydroxychloroquine (hcq) retinopathy while on the drug, and after drug cessation, using data from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (sd-oct).   methods a total of 102 sd-oct scans were obtained from 11 patients (classified as having early, moderate, or severe stages of toxicity) over a period of 4 years after cessation of hcq. the inner and outer retina boundaries were identified automatically to measure thickness and characterize progression topographically.   results the segmentation of retinal layers was verified in sd-oct cross-sections for all eyes and scans included in this study (a total of 102 scans). topographic analysis showed that inner retina was not involved in hcq toxicity to any meaningful degree, either between stages of retinopathy or after the drug is stopped. the characteristic bull's eye pattern of outer macula thinning appears when comparing moderate retinopathy (before any rpe damage) to the early stage. later damage, as toxicity evolved to a severe stage, was diffuse across most of the macula. if the drug was stopped at an early or moderate stage, progression was limited to the first year and occurred diffusely without parafoveal localization.   conclusions hydroxychloroquine retinopathy primarily involves outer retina (photoreceptors). outer retinal thinning while using hcq initially involves the parafovea, but becomes diffuse across the macula as damage progresses or after drug cessation. when hcq is stopped at an early or moderate stage (before rpe damage), progression seems to be limited to the first year.
cyberknife radiosurgery for the treatment of intraocular and periocular lymphoma. immunodysregulation appears to play a prominent role in the evolution of some lymphomas, as evidenced by the strong associations between congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies and lymphoid neoplasia, and abnormal ratios of helper t cells in lymphoid proliferations. lympho-proliferative diseases of the ocular adnexa encompass a spectrum of lesions that may present with similar clinical and radiological features. most primary lymphoid proliferations of the ocular adnexa consist of small lymphocytes of b-cell origin. employing morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic criteria, proliferations may be separated into polyclonal and monoclonal categories. increased insight into the biology and behavior of these tumors tells us that seemingly benign, as well as frankly malignant proliferations, might disseminate to nodal or extranodal sites. the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease of any type necessitates a complete workup for systemic lymphoma. major prognostic criteria for lymphomas are anatomical site, stage, and histological features. radiotherapy is employed for localized lymphoid proliferations, with chemotherapy recommended for disseminated disease. long-term follow-up with semiannual examination is recommended. a significant percentage of primary ocular adnexal lymphoid lesions are malt-type lymphomas, extranodal low-grade b-cell lymphomas usually associated with mucosal tissues or glandular epithelia. the pathogenesis of this lymphoma in orbital soft tissue, which normally is devoid of lymphoid tissue, lymphatic vessels, and epithelium, is unclear. malt-type lymphomas of the ocular adnexa follow an indolent course, with long periods between relapses, and are responsive to therapy. dissemination, when it occurs, preferentially affects other extranodal sites.

population whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across two tissues highlights the environment as the principal source of human methylome variation transcription factors and histone modifications are crucial regulators of gene expression that mutually influence each other. we present the dna binding profiles of upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (usf1, usf2) and acetylated histone h3 (h3ac) in a liver cell line for the whole human genome using chip-chip at a resolution of 35 base pairs. we determined that these three proteins bind mostly in proximity of protein coding genes transcription start sites (tsss), and their bindings are positively correlated with gene expression levels. based on the spatial and functional relationship between usfs and h3ac at protein coding gene promoters, we found similar promoter architecture for known genes and the novel and less-characterized transcripts human mrnas and spliced ests. furthermore, our analysis revealed a previously underestimated abundance of genes in a bidirectional conformation, where usfs are bound in between tsss. after taking into account this promoter conformation, the results indicate that h3ac is mainly located downstream of tss, and it is at this genomic location where it positively correlates with gene expression. finally, usf1, which is associated to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found to bind and potentially regulate nuclear mitochondrial genes as well as genes for lipid and cholesterol metabolism, frequently in collaboration with ga binding protein transcription factor alpha (gabpa, nuclear respiratory factor 2 [nrf-2]). this expands our understanding about the transcriptional control of metabolic processes and its alteration in metabolic disorders.
retention in opioid substitution treatment: a major predictor of long-term virological success for hiv-infected injection drug users receiving antiretroviral treatment. this paper describes the aactg adherence instruments, which are comprised of two self-report questionnaires for use in clinical trials conducted by the adult aids clinical trials group (aactg). the questionnaires were administered to 75 patients at ten aactg sites in the usa. all patients were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (art), including at least one protease inhibitor. eleven per cent of patients reported missing at least one dose the day before the interview, and 17% reported missing at least one dose during the two days prior. the most common reasons for missing medications included 'simply forgot' (66%) and a number of factors often associated with improved health, including being busy (53%), away from home (57%) and changes in routine (51%). less adherent patients reported lower adherence self-efficacy (p = 0.006) and were less sure of the link between non-adherence and the development of drug resistance (p = 0.009). they were also more likely to consume alcohol, to be employed outside the home for pay and to have enrolled in clinical trials to gain access to drugs (all p < 0.05). twenty-two per cent of patients taking drugs requiring special instructions were unaware of these instructions. each questionnaire took approximately ten minutes to complete. responses to the questionnaires were favourable. these questionnaires have been included in six aactg clinical trials to date and have been widely disseminated to investigators both in the usa and abroad.
changing health inequalities in germany from 1994 to 2008 between employed and unemployed adults the unification of germany in 1990 brought about substantial social and economic changes in its eastern part, with new uncertainties and, despite increasing overall income, rising inequality. this paper explores the potential impact on health of these changes during the 1990s, looking specifically at income-related health inequalities in east and west germany and its modulation by psychosocial factors. we used data from the german socio-economic panel (gsoep) for the years 1992 and 1997, including individuals aged 25+. we investigated changes in self-perceived health in the two parts of germany and its socio-economic and psychosocial determinants. analyses estimated odds ratios of less than good health using logistic regression. in 1992, 47% of east germans rated their health worse than good compared with 54% in the west. by 1997, the east-west gap in self-rated health had disappeared, with the prevalence of poor health increasing to 56% in both parts. income and education were important determinants of health in east and west, with, in the age-sex-adjusted model, those having available less than 60% of median equivalent income being at increased risk of poor health in 1992 (or(east) 2.39, 1.45-3.94; or(west) 2.04, 1.65-2.52). addition of education reduced the strength of this relationship only slightly. in the west, income-related health inequalities widened between 1992 and 1997 yet the initially stronger gradient declined in the east, despite an overall increase in income inequality (or(east) 1.63, 1.04-2.56; or(west) 2.65, 2.19-3.21). the impact of education remained stable. psychosocial variables were important determinants, mediating the effects of income, with leisure-cultural social involvement exerting the strongest effect in both east and west.the results show that, unlike in the west, the overall increase in income inequality in east germany between 1992 and 1997 was not accompanied by a simultaneous increase in income-related health inequalities. this suggests that mechanisms involved in the association of socio-economic factors and health possibly behave differently in east and west.
value of exercise tolerance testing in evaluation of diabetic patients presented with atypical chest discomfort aggressive medical therapy can be justified in most patients with diabetes, but there may be some higher-risk asymptomatic patients who could benefit from revascularization and/or medical therapy for myocardial ischemia. silent myocardial ischemia (smi) might be used to identify these high-risk individuals. in this review we define smi as objective evidence of ischemia from any noninvasive test occurring in an asymptomatic patient. we outline what is known about asymptomatic coronary heart disease (chd) in diabetes and how this relates to smi. we examine how smi predicts angiographic chd and chd events, and we describe the changing role of chd screening as reflected by various guidelines. we identify the recent research suggesting that there may be substantial numbers of high-risk asymptomatic patients who have diabetes with undiagnosed chd and who could benefit from more-active intervention; however, with the recent advances in medical therapy, and the uncertain benefits of screening, current guidelines strongly discourage this practice, except in limited clinical situations, such as before major surgery. carefully conducted clinical trails using state-of-the-art investigations and therapy in well-characterized patients with diabetes are urgently required to inform physicians on when and how to intervene.
racial and ethnic variation in home healthcare nurse depression assessment of older minority patients background. a number of self-administered questionnaires are available for assessing depression severity, including the 9-item patient health questionnaire depression module (phq-9). because even briefer measures might be desirable for use in busy clinical settings or as part of comprehensive health questionnaires, we evaluated a 2-item version of the phq depression module, the phq-2. methods. the phq-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each as 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). the phq-2 was completed by 6000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics–gynecology clinics. construct validity was assessed using the 20-item short-form general health survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (mhp) interview in a sample of 580 patients. results. as phq-2 depression severity increased from 0 to 6, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 sf-20 subscales. also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. using the mhp reinterview as the criterion standard, a phq-2 score ≥3 had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 92% for major depression. likelihood ratio and receiver operator characteristic analysis identified a phq-2 score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint for screening purposes. results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics–gynecology samples. conclusion. the construct and criterion validity of the phq-2 make it an attractive measure for depression screening.

short-term storage capacity for visual objects depends on expertise. detection of change when one display of familiar objects replaces another display might be based purely upon visual codes, or also on identity information (i.e., knowingwhat was presentwhere in the initial display). displays of 10 alphanumeric characters were presented and, after a brief offset, were presented again in the same position, with or without a change in a single character. subjects’ accuracy in change detection did not suggest preservation of any more information than is usually available in whole report, except with the briefest of offsets (under 50 msec). stimulus duration had only modest effects. the interaction of masking with offset duration followed the pattern previously observed with unfamiliar visual stimuli (phillips, 1974). accuracy was not reduced by reflection of the characters about a horizontal axis, suggesting that categorical information contributed negligibly. detection of change appears to depend upon capacity-limited visual memory; (putative) knowledge of what identities are present in different display locations does not seem to contribute.
age-related changes in hepatic expression and activity of cytochrome p450 in male rats in this study, we performed a screening of the specificities of rat cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoforms for metabolic reactions known as the specific probes of human cyp isoforms, using 13 rat cyp isoforms expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells or b-lymphoblastoid cells. among the metabolic reactions studied, diclofenac 4-hydroxylation (dfh), dextromethorphan o-demethylation (dmod) and midazolam 4-hydroxylation were specifically catalyzed by cyp2c6, cyp2d2 and cyp3a1/3a2, respectively. these results suggest that diclofenac 4-hydroxylation, dextromethorphan o-demethylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation are useful as catalytic markers of cyp2c6, cyp2d2 and cyp3a1/3a2, respectively. on the other hand, phenacetin o-deethylation and 7-ethoxyresorufin o-deethylation were catalyzed both by cyp1a2 and by cyp2c6. benzyloxyresorufin o-dealkylation and pentoxyresorufin o-dealkylation were also catalyzed by cyp1a2 in addition to cyp2b1. bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation was extensively catalyzed by cyp2d2 but also by cyp2c6 and cyp2c11. p-nitrophenol 2-hydroxylation and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation were extensively catalyzed by cyp2e1 but also by cyp1a2 and cyp3a1. therefore, it is necessary to conduct further study to clarify whether these activities in rat liver microsomes are useful as probes of rat cyp isoforms. in contrast, coumarin 7-hydroxylation and s- and r-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation did not show selectivity toward any isoforms of rat cyp studied. therefore, activities of coumarin 7-hydroxylation and s- and r-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation are not able to be used as catalytic probes of cyp isoforms in rat liver microsomes. these results may provide useful information regarding catalytic probes of rat cyps for studies using rat liver microsomal samples.
strain-specific impact of psar of streptococcus pneumoniae on global gene expression and virulence. recent murine studies have demonstrated that the role of response regulator 09 (rr09) of streptococcus pneumoniae in virulence is different in different strains. in the present study, we used a murine pneumonia model of infection to assess the virulence of a tigr4 rr09 mutant, and we found that tigr4deltarr09 was attenuated after intranasal infection. furthermore, we investigated the in vitro transcriptional changes in pneumococcal rr09 mutants of two strains, d39 and tigr4, by microarray analysis. the transcriptional profiles of the rr09 mutants of both strains had clear differences compared to the profiles of the parental wild-type strains. in d39deltarr09, but not in tigr4deltarr09, genes involved in competence (e.g., comab) were upregulated. in tigr4, genes located on the rlra pathogenicity islet, which are not present in the d39 genome, appeared to be regulated by rr09. furthermore, several phosphotransferase systems (ptss) believed to be involved in sugar uptake (e.g., the pts encoded by sp0060 to sp0066) were strongly downregulated in d39deltarr09, while they were not regulated by rr09 in tigr4. to examine the role of one of these ptss in virulence, d39deltasp0063 was constructed and tested in a murine infection model. no difference between the virulence of this strain and the virulence of the wild type was found, indicating that downregulation of the sp0063 gene alone is not the cause of the avirulent phenotype of d39deltarr09. finally, expression of rr09 and expression of three of our identified rr09 targets during infection in mice were assessed. this in vivo experiment confirmed that there were differences between expression in wild-type strain tigr4 and expression in the rr09 mutant, as well as differences between expression in wild-type strain d39 and expression in wild-type strain tigr4. in conclusion, our results indicate that there is strain-specific regulation of pneumococcal gene expression by rr09.
negotiating pain: the joint construction of a child's bodily sensation patients' physical incompetence is a feature of many clinical interactions; the challenges it presents are not only technical but also interactional. this paper examines how interpretations and interactional consequences of physical incompetence are dealt with during stroke physiotherapy. a conversation analytic approach was used to examine video-recorded treatment sessions. analysis demonstrated that managing physical incompetence forms an important element of the organisation of these interactions. through their conduct, patients and therapists limit and counter its various negative implications, including those which attribute it to failure of a patient's efforts, co-operation and personal competence, and failure of therapy. understanding orientations to incompetence and their influence upon interactions provides some explanations, or 'good reasons', for certain features of clinical interactions that have attracted criticism. analysis also shows how management of incompetence is grounded in the clinician's authority and contributes to its maintenance. in the face of failures of physical competence, participants collaboratively and continually work to portray patients as deserving of treatment rather than sanction, and to convey that despite evident difficulties, the therapeutic process is a co-operative and successful endeavour. the paper examines how these meanings are addressed and accomplished through interaction.
formation of the heyns rearrangement products in dihydroxyacetone and glycine maillard reaction: a computational study previous work by the author on diatomic molecules and by others on polyatomic systems has revealed that kohn–sham density‐functional theory with ‘‘gradient corrected’’ exchange‐correlation approximations gives remarkably good molecular bond and atomization energies. in the present communication, we report the results of an extensive survey of density‐functional atomization energies on the 55 molecules of the gaussian‐1 thermochemical data base of pople and co‐workers [j. chem. phys. 90, 5622 (1989); 93, 2537 (1990)]. these calculations have been performed by the fully numerical molecules (numol) program of becke and dickson [j. chem. phys. 92, 3610 (1990)] and are therefore free of basis‐set uncertainties. we find an average absolute error in the total atomization energies of our 55 test molecules of 3.7 kcal/mol, compared to 1.6 kcal/mol for the gaussian‐1 procedure and 1.2 kcal/mol for gaussian‐2.
regulatory sequences of orthologous petd chloroplast mrnas are highly specific among chlamydomonas species a computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. from these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. this information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. the maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. one of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. while the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. all possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. for this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must, be evaluated. a numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. the maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every
a concept language model for ad-hoc retrieval word embeddings, which are low-dimensional vector representations of vocabulary terms that capture the semantic similarity between them, have recently been shown to achieve impressive performance in many natural language processing tasks. the use of word embeddings in information retrieval, however, has only begun to be studied. in this paper, we explore the use of word embeddings to enhance the accuracy of query language models in the ad-hoc retrieval task. to this end, we propose to use word embeddings to incorporate and weight terms that do not occur in the query, but are semantically related to the query terms. we describe two embedding-based query expansion models with different assumptions. since pseudo-relevance feedback methods that use the top retrieved documents to update the original query model are well-known to be effective, we also develop an embedding-based relevance model, an extension of the effective and robust relevance model approach. in these models, we transform the similarity values obtained by the widely-used cosine similarity with a sigmoid function to have more discriminative semantic similarity values. we evaluate our proposed methods using three trec newswire and web collections. the experimental results demonstrate that the embedding-based methods significantly outperform competitive baselines in most cases. the embedding-based methods are also shown to be more robust than the baselines.
navigating with fingers and feet: analysis of human (homo sapiens) and rat (rattus norvegicus) movement organization during nonvisual spatial tasks. abstract the visual information on a scatterplot can be greatly enhanced, with little additional cost, by computing and plotting smoothed points. robust locally weighted regression is a method for smoothing a scatterplot, (x i , y i ), i = 1, …, n, in which the fitted value at z k is the value of a polynomial fit to the data using weighted least squares, where the weight for (x i , y i ) is large if x i is close to x k and small if it is not. a robust fitting procedure is used that guards against deviant points distorting the smoothed points. visual, computational, and statistical issues of robust locally weighted regression are discussed. several examples, including data on lead intoxication, are used to illustrate the methodology.
technology-assisted rehabilitation of writing skills in parkinson's disease: visual cueing versus intelligent feedback the purpose of this study was to develop an easy-to-use and psychometrically sound outcome instrument that is task-oriented and patient-centred. one hundred fifteen patients with a variety of hand impairments completed a rating scale of perceived manual ability (i.e., the manual ability measure). the first 70 patients also completed two other questionnaires about physical health and psychological well-being. rasch analyses were conducted to transform the ordinal ratings into linear measures; rasch statistics were used to evaluate its measurement properties at both scale and item levels. eighty-three original items were reduced to 16 common tasks; rasch reliabilities were good; the easy-to-difficult item hierarchy makes sense clinically. moderate correlations were found between manual ability, physical function and general sense of well-being. the results of this preliminary study suggest that the mam is a promising outcome measure that has adequate psychometric properties and can be used to complement other objective clinical measurements.
is male rhesus macaque red color ornamentation attractive to females? the past decade has seen an increasing shift in animal communication towards more studies that incorporate aspects of signaling in multiple modalities. although nonhuman primates are an excellent group for studying the extent to which different aspects of condition may be signaled in different modalities, and how such information may be integrated during mate choice, very few studies of primate species have incorporated such analyses. here, we present data from free-ranging male rhesus macaques on sex skin coloration (modeled to receiver perception), bark vocal signals, androgen levels, morphometric variables, dominance status, and female mate choice. we show that, consistent with data on females, most intra- and interindividual variation in sex skin appearance occurs in luminance rather than color. sex skin luminance was significantly correlated across different skin regions. sex skin luminance did not correlate with the majority of bark parameters, suggesting the potential for the two signals to convey different information. sex skin appearance was not related to androgen levels although we found some evidence for links between androgen levels and bark parameters, several of which were also related to morphometric variables. we found no evidence that either signal was related to male dominance rank or used in female mate choice, though more direct measures of female proceptive behavior are needed. overall, the function of male sex skin coloration in this species remains unclear. our study is among the first nonhuman primate studies to incorporate measurements of multiple signals in multiple modalities, and we encourage other authors to incorporate such analyses into their work.
testing foetal–maternal heart rate synchronization via model-based analyses there occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. the important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recordhag information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. it can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. a generalization of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.the object of this paper is to throw light on the relationships between certain classes of econometric models involving feedback and the functions arising in spectral analysis, particularly the cross spectrum and the partial cross spectrum. causality and feedback are here defined in an explicit and testable fashion. it is shown that in the two-variable case the feedback mechanism can be broken down into two causal relations and that the cross spectrum can be considered as the sum of two cross spectra, each closely connected with one of the causations. the next three sections of the paper briefly introduce those aspects of spectral methods, model building, and causality which are required later. section iv presents the results for the two-variable case and section v generalizes these results for three variables.
the hippocampal/parahippocampal regions and recognition memory: insights from visual paired comparison versus object-delayed nonmatching in monkeys monkeys in whom the fornix had been transected and controls were trained on two versions of delayed non-matching to sample (dnms). on dnms-lss the stimulus pair for each trial was selected from a large set of junk objects so that the animals saw particular stimuli infrequently. on dnms-rs the same two stimuli were presented repeatedly. memory for the sample was assessed with retention intervals of 10, 70 and 130 sec spent either in the dark or with levels of illumination designed to promote interference effects. on dnms-lss the lesioned animals were impaired, being more susceptible than controls to increases in the retention interval. however, neither group was particularly sensitive to interference. in contrast, on dnms-rs the lesioned monkeys were unimpaired, both groups showing a marked decrement in performance with increasing retention interval and a high sensitivity to the effects of interference. these data suggest that monkeys possess a short-term memory which is intact after transection of the fornix and a long-term memory which is not.
paper latitudinal diversity relationships of fiddler crabs: biogeographic differences united by temperature we developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). the climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. we used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the anusplin package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. we quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the pacific. aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. a comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. a comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the united states also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. in future work, such variation might be captured through knowledgebased methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing. copyright  2005 royal meteorological society.
cigarette demand and delayed reward discounting in nicotine-dependent individuals with schizophrenia and controls: an initial study a behavioral economic approach to alcohol use disorders (auds) emphasizes both individual and environmental determinants of alcohol use. the current study examined individual differences in alcohol demand (i.e., motivation for alcohol under escalating conditions of price) and delayed reward discounting (i.e., preference for immediate small rewards compared to delayed larger rewards) in 61 heavy drinkers (62% with an aud). in addition, based on theoretical accounts that emphasize the role of craving in reward valuation and preferences for immediate rewards, craving for alcohol was also examined in relation to these behavioral economic variables and the alcohol-related variables. intensity of alcohol demand and delayed reward discounting were significantly associated with aud symptoms, but not with quantitative measures of alcohol use, and were also moderately correlated with each other. likewise, craving was significantly associated with aud symptoms, but not with alcohol use, and was also significantly correlated with both intensity of demand and delayed reward discounting. these findings further emphasize the relevance of behavioral economic indices of motivation to auds and the potential importance of craving for alcohol in this relationship.
pseudomonas aeruginosa tolerance to tobramycin, hydrogen peroxide and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is quorum-sensing dependent. it has been reported that mutations in the quorum-sensing genes lasi and rhli in pseudomonas aeruginosa result in, among many other things, loss of twitching motility (a. glessner, r. s. smith, b. h. iglewski, and j. b. robinson, j. bacteriol. 181:1623-1629, 1999). we constructed knockouts of lasi and rhli and the corresponding regulatory genes lasr and rhlr and found no effect on twitching motility. however, twitching-defective variants accumulated during culturing of lasi and rhli mutants. further analysis showed that the stable twitching-defective variants of lasi and rhli mutants had arisen as a consequence of secondary mutations in vfr and algr, respectively, both of which encode key regulators affecting a variety of phenotypes, including twitching motility. in addition, when grown in shaking broth culture, lasi and rhli mutants, but not the wild-type parent, also accumulated unstable variants that lacked both twitching motility and swimming motility and appeared to be identical in phenotype to the s1 and s2 variants that were recently reported to occur at high frequencies in p. aeruginosa strains grown as a biofilm or in static broth culture (e. deziel, y. comeau, and r. villemur, j. bacteriol. 183:1195-1204, 2001). these results indicate that mutations in one regulatory system may create distortions that select during subsequent culturing for compensatory mutations in other regulatory genes within the cellular network. this problem may have compromised some past studies of regulatory hierarchies controlled by quorum sensing and of bacterial regulatory systems in general.
remediation of waterways in agricultural settings using organic mulch the antimicrobial activity of manuka honey has been well documented (molan, 1992a,b,c, 1997) [molan, p.c., 1992. the antibacterial activity of honey. 1: the nature of the antibacterial activity. bee world 73 (1) 5-28; molan, p.c., 1992. the antibacterial activity of honey. 2: variation in the potency of the antibacterial activity. bee world 73 (2) 59-76; molan, p.c., 1992. medicinal uses for honey. beekeepers quarterly 26; molan, p.c., 1997. finding new zealand honeys with outstanding antibacterial and antifungal activity. new zealand beekeeper 4 (10) 20-26]. the current bioassays for determining this antimicrobial effect employ a well diffusion (ahn and stiles, 1990) [ahn, c., stiles, m.e., 1990. antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from vacuum-packed meats. journal of applied bacteriology 69, 302-310], (weston et al., 1999) [weston, r.j., mitchell, k.r., allen, k.l., 1999. antibacterial phenolic components of new zealand manuka honey. j. food chem. 64, 295-301] or disc diffusion (taormina et al., 2001) [taormina, peter j., niemira, brendan a., beuchat, larry r., 2001. inhibitory activity of honey against food borne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power. int. j. food microbiol. 69, 217-225] assay using zones of inhibition as indicators of bacterial susceptibility. the development of a 24-h spectrophotometric assay employing 96-well microtiter plates, that is more sensitive and more amenable to statistical analysis than the assays currently employed, was undertaken. this simple and rapid assay permits extensive kinetic studies even in the presence of low honey concentrations, and is capable of detecting inhibitory levels below those recorded for well or disc diffusion assays. in this paper, we compare the assay to both well and disc diffusion assays. the results we obtained for the spectrophotometric method mic values show that this method has greater sensitivity than the standard well and disc diffusion assays. in addition, inter- and intra-assay variance for this method was investigated, demonstrating the methods reproducibility and repeatability.
intensity- and muscle-specific fascicle behavior during human drop jumps. the present study was designed to examine fascicle-tendon interaction in the synergistic medial gastrocnemius (mg) and soleus (sol) muscles during drop jumps (dj) performed from different drop heights (dh). eight subjects performed unilateral dj with maximal rebounds on a sledge apparatus from different dh. during the exercises, fascicle lengths (using ultrasonography) and electromyographic activities were recorded. the results showed that the fascicles of the mg and sol muscles behaved differently during the contact phase, but the whole muscle-tendon unit and its tendinous tissue lengthened before shortening in both muscles. the sol fascicles also lengthened before shortening during the ground contact in all conditions. during the braking phase, the sol activation increased with increasing dh. however, the amplitude of sol fascicle lengthening was not dependent on dh during the same phase. in the mg muscle, the fascicles primarily shortened during the braking phase in the lower dh condition. however, in the higher dh conditions, the mg fascicles either behaved isometrically or were lengthened during the braking phase. these results suggest that the fascicles of synergistic muscles (mg and sol) can behave differently during dj and that, with increasing dh, there may be specific length change patterns of the fascicles of mg but not of sol.
influence of aging on level and layer-specific left ventricular longitudinal strain in subjects without structural heart disease. the rapid technological developments of the past decade and the changes in echocardiographic practice brought about by these developments have resulted in the need for updated recommendations to the previously published guidelines for cardiac chamber quantification, which was the goal of the joint writing group assembled by the american society of echocardiography and the european association of cardiovascular imaging. this document provides updated normal values for all four cardiac chambers, including three-dimensional echocardiography and myocardial deformation, when possible, on the basis of considerably larger numbers of normal subjects, compiled from multiple databases. in addition, this document attempts to eliminate several minor discrepancies that existed between previously published guidelines.
remote effects of hippocampal damage on default network connectivity in the human brain abstract the need for a simply applied quantitative assessment of handedness is discussed and some previous forms reviewed. an inventory of 20 items with a set of instructions and response- and computational-conventions is proposed and the results obtained from a young adult population numbering some 1100 individuals are reported. the separate items are examined from the point of view of sex, cultural and socio-economic factors which might appertain to them and also of their inter-relationship to each other and to the measure computed from them all. criteria derived from these considerations are then applied to eliminate 10 of the original 20 items and the results recomputed to provide frequency-distribution and cumulative frequency functions and a revised item-analysis. the difference of incidence of handedness between the sexes is discussed.
evidence for specificity of motor impairments in catching and balance in children with autism the autism diagnostic observation schedule—generic (ados-g) is a semistructured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. the observational schedule consists of four 30-minute modules, each designed to be administered to different individuals according to their level of expressive language. psychometric data are presented for 223 children and adults with autistic disorder (autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pddnos) or nonspectrum diagnoses. within each module, diagnostic groups were equivalent on expressive language level. results indicate substantial interrater and test—retest reliability for individual items, excellent interrater reliability within domains and excellent internal consistency. comparisons of means indicated consistent differentiation of autism and pddnos from nonspectrum individuals, with some, but less consistent, differentiation of autism from pddnos. a priori operationalization of dsm-iv/icd-10 criteria, factor analyses, and roc curves were used to generate diagnostic algorithms with thresholds set for autism and broader autism spectrum/pdd. algorithm sensitivities and specificities for autism and pddnos relative to nonspectrum disorders were excellent, with moderate differentiation of autism from pddnos.
charge structure in volcanic plumes: a comparison of plume properties predicted by an integral plume model to observations of volcanic lightning during the 2010 eruption of eyjafjallajökull, iceland the behavior of water in magma in the earth is fairly well understood in volcanology, and the behavior of water in the atmosphere is decently understood in meteorology. this study tries to bridge the perceived gap in understanding that lies in the transition from earth to the atmosphere. since electric charge separations and lightning are prevalent in volcanic eruptions, and since the fundamental role of ice particle collisions in the separation of electric charge and generation of lightning in thunderclouds is now fairly well established, the study concerns itself with an evaluation of volcanic eruptions as ice factories that occur in the atmosphere.
shadow of a doubt: testing for divergences between software versions we present a new symbolic execution tool, klee, capable of automatically generating tests that achieve high coverage on a diverse set of complex and environmentally-intensive programs. we used klee to thoroughly check all 89 stand-alone programs in the gnu coreutils utility suite, which form the core user-level environment installed on millions of unix systems, and arguably are the single most heavily tested set of open-source programs in existence. klee-generated tests achieve high line coverage -- on average over 90% per tool (median: over 94%) -- and significantly beat the coverage of the developers' own hand-written test suite. when we did the same for 75 equivalent tools in the busybox embedded system suite, results were even better, including 100% coverage on 31 of them.    we also used klee as a bug finding tool, applying it to 452 applications (over 430k total lines of code), where it found 56 serious bugs, including three in coreutils that had been missed for over 15 years. finally, we used klee to crosscheck purportedly identical busybox and coreutils utilities, finding functional correctness errors and a myriad of inconsistencies.
performance evaluation of a single mode-multi mode cost efficient fiber link used for 4/16/64 qam gigabit ofdm mmw transmission using different mzm modulation schemes in this paper, we relate the error vector magnitude (evm) bit error rate (ber) and signal to noise ratio (snr). we also present the fact that with such relationship it would be possible to predict or in cases substitute evm in places of ber or even snr. in doing so, we first define evm with normalization so that the definition stands for multi-modulation systems, viz. binary phas shift keying (bpsk), quadrature phase shift keying (qpsk) etc. we also compare among the different performance metrics and show that evm can be equivalently useful as signal to noise ratio and bit error rate. the relationships are based on stream based communication systems. a few monte carlo simulations are carried out to illustrate the performance of evm based on these relationships.
long-term adherence to antiretroviral treatment and program drop-out in a high-risk urban setting in sub-saharan africa: a prospective cohort study this paper describes the aactg adherence instruments, which are comprised of two self-report questionnaires for use in clinical trials conducted by the adult aids clinical trials group (aactg). the questionnaires were administered to 75 patients at ten aactg sites in the usa. all patients were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (art), including at least one protease inhibitor. eleven per cent of patients reported missing at least one dose the day before the interview, and 17% reported missing at least one dose during the two days prior. the most common reasons for missing medications included 'simply forgot' (66%) and a number of factors often associated with improved health, including being busy (53%), away from home (57%) and changes in routine (51%). less adherent patients reported lower adherence self-efficacy (p = 0.006) and were less sure of the link between non-adherence and the development of drug resistance (p = 0.009). they were also more likely to consume alcohol, to be employed outside the home for pay and to have enrolled in clinical trials to gain access to drugs (all p < 0.05). twenty-two per cent of patients taking drugs requiring special instructions were unaware of these instructions. each questionnaire took approximately ten minutes to complete. responses to the questionnaires were favourable. these questionnaires have been included in six aactg clinical trials to date and have been widely disseminated to investigators both in the usa and abroad.
justifying the judgment process a ff ects confidence but neither accuracy , nor strategy use the distinction between similarity-based and rule-based strategies has instigated a large body of research in categorization and judgment. within both domains, the task characteristics guiding strategy shifts are increasingly well documented. across domains, past research has observed shifts from rule-based strategies in judgment to similarity-based strategies in categorization, but limited these comparisons to 1 prototypical environment, a linear task structure, and a restricted set of strategies. to systematically compare the 2 domains, we considered several instantiations of rule-based and similarity-based strategies and examined strategy choice across different types of judgment and categorization tasks. between participants, we varied task characteristics from a 1-dimensional linear to a multidimensional linear and to 2 multidimensional nonlinear tasks. irrespective of domain, strategies considered, or model comparison technique used, we find that more participants relied on similarity-based strategies when the functional relationship between the cues and the criterion was nonlinear. shifts from rule-based strategies in judgment to similarity-based strategies in categorization, however, were rare and most pronounced in 1-dimensional environments. these results support the hypothesis that the cognitive strategies people select to solve a judgment or categorization task depend less on the domain but more on the complexity of the task.

multidrug efflux pump overexpression in staphylococcus aureus after single and multiple in vitro exposures to biocides and dyes. a new method for determining nucleotide sequences in dna is described. it is similar to the "plus and minus" method [sanger, f. & coulson, a. r.

brain activation of the defensive and appetitive survival systems in obsessive compulsive disorder the yale-brown obsessive compulsive scale was designed to remedy the problems of existing rating scales by providing a specific measure of the severity of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder that is not influenced by the type of obsessions or compulsions present. the scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms) (total range, 0 to 40), with separate subtotals for severity of obsessions and compulsions. in a study involving four raters and 40 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder at various stages of treatment, interrater reliability for the total yale-brown scale score and each of the 10 individual items was excellent, with a high degree of internal consistency among all item scores demonstrated with cronbach's alpha coefficient. based on pretreatment assessment of 42 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, each item was frequently endorsed and measured across a range of severity. these findings suggest that the yale-brown scale is a reliable instrument for measuring the severity of illness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with a range of severity and types of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
smoking behavior of mexicans: patterns by birth-cohort, gender, and education aims to investigate the reliability and validity of retrospectively reported information on smoking.   design nationally representative retrospective data from longitudinal surveys and contemporaneous data from repeated cross-sectional surveys were used.   participants adult respondents to three of the four samples of the national longitudinal surveys original cohort 1966-68; the national longitudinal survey of youth 1979; and various waves of the us national health interview survey.   measurements reliability was investigated by calculating kappa statistics for repeated measures of ever-smoking and annual-smoking status. validity was investigated by comparing smoking prevalence rates generated by retrospective data with contemporaneously measured rates.   findings kappa statistics indicated the repeated measures of ever-smoking status show substantial agreement; repeated measures of annual-smoking status show moderate agreement. retrospective reports on smoking behavior produced prevalence rates that match reasonably well with those from contemporaneous reports of smoking behavior.   conclusions retrospective data on smoking can be an important resource for tobacco addiction research.
an assessment of fixed and native chromatin preparation methods to study histone post-translational modifications at a whole genome scale in skeletal muscle tissue backgroundchromatin remodeling, histone modifications and other chromatin-related processes play a crucial role in gene regulation. a very useful technique to study these processes is chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip). chip is widely used for a few model systems, including arabidopsis, but establishment of the technique for other organisms is still remarkably challenging. furthermore, quantitative analysis of the precipitated material and normalization of the data is often underestimated, negatively affecting data quality.resultswe developed a robust chip protocol, using maize (zea mays) as a model system, and present a general strategy to systematically optimize this protocol for any type of tissue. we propose endogenous controls for active and for repressed chromatin, and discuss various other controls that are essential for successful chip experiments. we experienced that the use of quantitative pcr (qpcr) is crucial for obtaining high quality chip data and we explain why. the method of data normalization has a major impact on the quality of chip analyses. therefore, we analyzed different normalization strategies, resulting in a thorough discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of the various approaches.conclusionhere we provide a robust chip protocol and strategy to optimize the protocol for any type of tissue; we argue that quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) is the best method to analyze the precipitates, and present comprehensive insights into data normalization.
lidar data reduction for efficient and high quality dem generation digital elevation models (dems) play an important role in terrain related applications, and their accuracy is crucial for dem applications. there are many factors that affect the accuracy of dems, with the main factors including the accuracy, density and distribution of the source data, the interpolation algorithm, and the dem resolution. generally  speaking, the more accurate and the denser the sampled terrain data are, the more accurate the produced dem will be. traditional methods such as field surveying and photogrammetry can yield high accuracy terrain data, but are very time consuming and labour intensive. moreover, in some situations such as in densely forested areas, it is impossible to use these methods for collecting elevation data. light detection and ranging (lidar) offers high density data capture. the high accuracy three dimensional  terrain points prerequisite to very detailed high  resolution dems generation offers exciting prospects to dem builders. however, because there is no sampling density selection for different area during a lidar data collection mission, some terrains may be oversampled thereby imposing increases in data storage requirements and processing time. improved efficiency in these terms can accrue if redundant data can be identified and eliminated from the input data  set. with a reduction in data, a more manageable and  operationally sized terrain dataset for dem generation is possible (anderson et al., 2005a). the primary objective of data reduction is to achieve an optimum balance between density of sampling and volume of data, hence optimizing cost of data collection (robinson, 1994). some studies on terrain data reduction have been conducted based on the  analysis of the effects of data reduction on the accuracy of dems and derived terrain attributes. for example, anderson et al. (2005b) evaluated the effects of lidar data density on the production of dem at different resolution. they produced a series of dems at different horizontal resolutions along a lidar point-density gradient, and then compared each of these dems to a reference dem produced  from the original lidar data, this having been acquired at the highest available density. their results showed that higher resolution dem generation is more sensitive to data density than is lower resolution dem generation. it was also  demonstrated that lidar datasets could withstand substantial data reductions yet still maintain adequate accuracy for elevation predictions (anderson et al., 2005a)  this study explored the effects of lidar point density on dem accuracy and examined to scope for data volume reduction compatible with maintaining efficiency in data storage and processing. something of the relationship between data density, data file size, and processing time also emerges from this study.
uv-a-induced structural and functional changes in human lens deamidated αb-crystallin purpose to elucidate the effect of deamidation on the structural and functional properties of human alphab-crystallin.   methods site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate three deamidated mutants of alphab-crystallin: n78d, n146d, and n78d/n146d. the mutations were confirmed by dna sequencing and matrix-assisted desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry. recombinant native alphab-crystallin (wild type [wt]) and the three mutated alphab species were expressed, and each species was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. the structural and functional properties compared with wt protein were investigated, respectively, by static light scattering (sls), circular dichroism (cd), and fluorescence spectroscopy and by determining chaperone activity with the use of three substrates.   results native wt and the n78d mutant showed relatively higher chaperone activity compared with the n146d and n78d/n146d mutants with all the substrates. further, during binding experiments with 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ans), the wt and n78d mutant showed relatively more solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues than the n146d and n78d/n146d mutants. on determining far-uv circular dichroism and tryptophan (trp) fluorescence spectra, significant secondary and tertiary structural changes were observed in the n146d and n78d/n146d mutants compared with wt and the n78d mutant. the static light scattering data showed a high order of oligomerization in all the three mutants. n146d and n78d/n146d formed the largest oligomers of 750 and 770 kda, respectively, compared with wt (580 kda).   conclusions the results show that the deamidation of n146 but not of n78 have profound effects on the structural and functional properties of alphab-crystallin.
sensitivity of patterns of molecular evolution to alterations in methodology: a critique of hughes and yeager two simple methods for estimating the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions are presented. although they give no weights to different types of codon substitutions, these methods give essentially the same results as those obtained by miyata and yasunaga's and by li et al.'s methods. computer simulation indicates that estimates of synonymous substitutions obtained by the two methods are quite accurate unless the number of nucleotide substitutions per site is very large. it is shown that all available methods tend to give an underestimate of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions when the number is large.
the multiplicative interactions of leukocyte counts with some other risk factors enhance the prognostic value for coronary artery disease. the past decade has witnessed major strides in the prevention of coronary heart disease (chd) through modification of its causes. the most dramatic advance has been the demonstration that aggressive medical therapy will substantially reduce the likelihood of recurrent major coronary syndromes in patients with established chd (secondary prevention). the american heart association (aha) and the american college of cardiology (acc) have published joint recommendations for medical intervention in patients with chd and other forms of atherosclerotic disease.1 a similar potential exists for risk reduction in patients without established chd (primary prevention). however, the risk status of persons without chd varies greatly, and this variability mandates a range in the intensity of interventions. effective primary prevention thus requires an assessment of risk to categorize patients for selection of appropriate interventions. the present statement is being published jointly by the aha and acc to outline current issues and approaches to global risk assessment for primary prevention. the approaches described in this statement can be used for guidance at several levels of primary prevention; however, the statement does not attempt to specifically link risk assessment to treatment guidelines for particular risk factors. nonetheless, it provides critical background information that can be used in the development of new treatment guidelines.  the major and independent risk factors for chd are cigarette smoking of any amount, elevated blood pressure, elevated serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), diabetes mellitus, and advancing age (table 1⇓). the quantitative relationship between these risk factors and chd risk has been elucidated by the framingham heart study2 and other studies. these studies2 show that the major risk factors are additive in predictive power. accordingly, the total risk of a person can be estimated by a summing of the risk …
codon adaptation of plastid genes circular bacterial chromosomes have highly polarized nucleotide composition in the two replichores, and this genomic strand asymmetry can be visualized using gc skew graphs. here we propose and discuss the gc skew index (gcsi) for the quantification of genomic compositional skew, which combines a normalized measure of fast fourier transform to capture the shape of the skew graph and euclidean distance between the two vertices in a cumulative skew graph to represent the degree of skew. we calculated gcsi for all available bacterial genomes, and gcsi correlated well with the visibility of gc skew. this novel index is useful for estimating confidence levels for the prediction of replication origin and terminus by methods based on gc skew and for measuring the strength of replicational selection in a genome.
regulatory sequences of orthologous petd chloroplast mrnas are highly specific among chlamydomonas species chloroplast components known to be coded by chloroplast dna include chloroplast rrnas, trnas, and the large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase. because these components comprise less than 3% of the estimated coding capacity of the chloroplast genome, most chloroplast gene functions have yet to be identified. one approach to this problem is the isolation and characterization of mutations in the chloroplast genome affecting specific photosynthetic functions. recently we have found that such mutations can be preferentially recovered by using arsenate selection on cells previously grown in 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. sixteen mutants thus isolated have been localized into nine chloroplast loci, based on their ability to recombine and produce photosynthetically competent progeny. mutants at two loci show the characteristic syndrome of photosynthetic defects that results from a deficiency in chloroplast protein synthesis. these have been found to lack chloroplast ribosome monomers. mutants at three loci are missing chlorophyll-protein complex i in their thylakoid membranes. mutants at three other loci are deficient in membrane polypeptides known to be associated with the chloroplast coupling factor.
coping flexibility and trauma: the perceived ability to cope with trauma (pact) scale researchers have documented the consequences of both expressing and suppressing emotion using between-subjects designs. it may be argued, however, that successful adaptation depends not so much on any one regulatory process, but on the ability to flexibly enhance or suppress emotional expression in accord with situational demands. we tested this hypothesis among new york city college students in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks. subjects' performance in a laboratory task in which they enhanced emotional expression, suppressed emotional expression, and behaved normally on different trials was examined as a prospective predictor of their adjustment across the first two years of college. results supported the flexibility hypothesis. a regression analysis controlling for initial distress and motivation and cognitive resources found that subjects who were better able to enhance and suppress the expression of emotion evidenced less distress by the end of the second year. memory deficits were also observed for both the enhancement and the suppression tasks, suggesting that both processes require cognitive resources.

wound risk assessment in ventral hernia repair: generation and internal validation of a risk stratification system using the acs-nsqip despite advances in surgical technique and prosthetic technologies, the risks for recurrence and infection are high following the repair of incisional ventral hernias. high-quality data suggest that all ventral hernia repairs should be reinforced with prosthetic repair materials. the current standard for reinforced hernia repair is synthetic mesh, which can reduce the risk for recurrence in many patients. however, permanent synthetic mesh can pose a serious clinical problem in the setting of infection. assessing patients' risk for wound infection and other surgical-site occurrences, therefore, is an outstanding need. to our knowledge, there currently exists no consensus in the literature regarding the accurate assessment of risk of surgical-site occurrences in association with or the appropriate techniques for the repair of incisional ventral hernias. this article proposes a novel hernia grading system based on risk factor characteristics of the patient and the wound. using this system, surgeons may better assess each patient's risk for surgical-site occurrences and thereby select the appropriate surgical technique, repair material, and overall clinical approach for the patient. a generalized approach and technical considerations for the repair of incisional ventral hernias are outlined, including the appropriate use of component separation and the growing role of biologic repair materials.
reduced referral and case fatality rates for severe symptomatic hyperlactataemia in a south african public sector antiretroviral programme: a retrospective observational study objective to describe province-wide outcomes and temporal trends of the western cape province antiretroviral treatment (art) programme 5 years since inception, and to demonstrate the utility of the who monitoring system for art.   methods the treatment programme started in 2001 through innovator sites. rapid scaling-up of art provision began early in 2004, located predominantly in primary-care facilities. data on patients starting art were prospectively captured into facility-based registers, from which monthly cross-sectional activity and quarterly cohort reports were aggregated. retention in care, mortality, loss to follow-up and laboratory outcomes were calculated at 6-monthly durations on art.   findings by the end of march 2006, 16 234 patients were in care. the cohort analysis included 12 587 adults and 1709 children. women accounted for 70% of adults enrolled. after 4 and 3 years on art respectively, 72.0% of adults (95% confidence interval, ci: 68.0-75.6) and 81.5% (95% ci: 75.7-86.1) of children remained in care. the percentage of adults starting art with cd4 counts less than 50 cells/microl fell from 51.3% in 2001 to 21.5% in 2005, while mortality at 6 months fell from 12.7% to 6.6%, offset in part by an increase in loss to follow-up (reaching 4.7% at 6 months in 2005). over 85% of adults tested had viral loads below 400 copies/ml at 6-monthly durations until 4 years on art.   conclusion the location of care in primary-care sites in this programme was associated with good retention in care, while the scaling-up of art provision was associated with reduced early mortality.
soundxy4: supporting tabletop collaboration and awareness with ambisonics spatialisation this paper describes the reactable*, a novel multi-user electro-acoustic music instrument with a tabletop tangible user interface, which is being developed at the mtg in barcelona. we first introduce the reactable* project and some of the concepts behind its design and we then discuss interaction and performance scenarios.
does the technique of lateral cross-wiring (dorgan’s technique) reduce iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury? between january 1, 1994 and december 31, 1997, we evaluated 138 children with displaced supracondylar distal humerus fractures treated by closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. there were 49 type ii fractures and 89 type iii fractures. three principal pin configurations were used at the surgeon's discretion: 2 lateral pins (42 fractures), 1 medial and 1 lateral pin (37 fractures), and 1 medial and 2 lateral pins (57 fractures). there was no statistically significant difference in clinical stability between these groups. one type iii fracture pinned using two lateral pins showed marked rotational instability. we recommend using two lateral pins when treating type ii fractures. type iii fractures should be treated using two lateral pins initially and, if the elbow demonstrates significant intraoperative rotational instability, a medial pin should be added. if a medial pin is necessary, and the ulnar nerve cannot be identified by palpation, a small incision should be made and the pin placed under direct vision.
whole-cell maldi-tof mass spectrometry and multilocus sequence analysis in the discrimination of pseudomonas stutzeri populations: three novel genomovars an examination of the results of phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of fragments of the 16s rrna, gyrb and rpod genes, and the discrimination of genomovars based on siderophore diversity within the genus pseudomonas, has added important taxonomic tools in the characterization of pseudomonas stutzeri. eighteen reference strains, nine newly identified hydrocarbon-degrading strains and three strains showing relevant physiological characteristics of p. stutzeri, together with the type strains of four related species, were included in the study. a novel genomovar within the species is described. a summary of the methodology used in these studies and the results of our attempts to define a solid internal subdivision of this important species within the genus pseudomonas are presented and discussed.
clinical and pathologic features of h-type bovine spongiform encephalopathy associated with e211k prion protein polymorphism bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cattle, first detected in 1986 in the united kingdom and subsequently in other countries. it is the most likely cause of variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease (vcjd) in humans, but the origin of bse has not been elucidated so far. this report describes the identification and characterization of two cases of bse diagnosed in the united states. case 1 (december 2003) exhibited spongiform changes in the obex area of the brainstem and the presence of the abnormal form of the prion protein, prpsc, in the same brain area, by immunohistochemistry (ihc) and western blot analysis. initial suspect diagnosis of bse for case 2 (november 2004) was made by a rapid elisa-based bse test. case 2 did not exhibit unambiguous spongiform changes in the obex area, but prpsc was detected by ihc and enrichment western blot analysis in the obex. using western blot analysis, prpsc from case 1 showed molecular features similar to typical bse isolates, whereas prpsc from case 2 revealed an unusual molecular prpsc pattern: molecular mass of the unglycosylated and monoglycosylated isoform was higher than that of typical bse isolates and case 2 was strongly labeled with antibody p4, which is consistent with a higher molecular mass. sequencing of the prion protein gene of both bse-positive animals revealed that the sequences of both animals were within the range of the prion protein gene sequence diversity previously reported for cattle.
cost-effectiveness of the third-agent class in treatment-naive human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in portugal setting and objective the antiretroviral therapy (art) cohort collaboration published models predicting progression to aids or death (the complement of aids-free survival) and death (the complement of absolute survival). the objective is to validate the model on independent data from cascade.   study design discrimination was assessed using concordance statistics, and calibration was examined by comparing predicted survival curves with the corresponding kaplan-meier estimates. accuracy was assessed by comparing predicted percentage probability of survival with the kaplan-meier estimate at yearly intervals after start of therapy.   results there was little loss of model discrimination when applying the model to cascade. overall predicted calibration curves agreed with kaplan-meier survival curves. predicted probabilities of aids or death at 3 years after starting haart ranged from 4.3% in the low-risk group to 20.5% in high-risk patients, with corresponding kaplan-meier estimates ranging from 4.0% to 18.3%; for death predictions, the probabilities ranged from 1.2% to 7.3% and estimates from 1.1% to 8.6%.   conclusion the predictions from the model agree with observed outcomes in cascade to within the 95% upper and lower kaplan-meier estimates. the prognostic model appears to be accurate in terms of discrimination and calibration, giving reliable and transportable predictions up to 3 years after the start of haart.
gender differences in molecular remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy. background we tested the hypothesis that long-term administration of the specific angiotensin ii subtype 1 (at1)-receptor blocker bms-186295 will regress hypertrophy and modify left ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) expression in rats with ascending aortic stenosis.   methods and results six weeks after surgery, rats with ascending aortic stenosis were randomized to receive either the at1-receptor blocker bms-186295 50 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 49), amlodipine 2.5 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 48) as a positive control for systemic vasodilation, or no drug (n = 48) and compared with sham-operated rats (n = 39). drug treatment was continued for 15 weeks. left ventricular ace mrna levels were measured by ribonuclease protection assay. the left ventricular/body weight ratio was increased 43% in hearts from rats with untreated left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) versus control hearts (p < .05). however, there was no difference in either the left ventricular/body weight ratio (2.78 +/- 0.08 versus 2.81 +/- 0.20 mg/g; p = ns) or myocyte cross-sectional area in the at1-blocker-treated versus untreated lvh hearts. amlodipine also showed no effect on regression of hypertrophy. in vivo left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly higher in untreated lvh versus sham-operated rats (193 +/- 8 versus 118 +/- 4 mm hg; p < .05), and there was a similar severe elevation of left ventricular systolic pressure in the at1-blocker- and amlodipine-treated lvh groups (189 +/- 9 and 188 +/- 16 mm hg; p = ns versus untreated lvh). in vivo left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher in the untreated lvh than in the sham-operated rats (14.8 +/- 2.3 versus 7.0 +/- 0.5 mm hg; p < .05). left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was lower in the at1-blocker-treated (11.0 +/- 1.7 mm hg) and amlodipine-treated rats (11.5 +/- 1.8 mm hg) and was similar to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the sham-operated rats (p = ns). left ventricular ace mrna levels were elevated in untreated lvh rats but were normalized in both the at1-blocker-treated rats and amlodipine-treated rats.   conclusions long-term at1-receptor blockade did not regress lvh in rats with persistent systolic pressure overload due to ascending aortic stenosis. however, both at1-receptor blockade and amlodipine improved in vivo left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in association with the normalization of left ventricular ace mrna levels.
separating decision and encoding noise in signal detection tasks. rosner and kochanski (2009) noticed an inconsistency in the mathematical statement of the law of categorical judgment and derived "the valid equation, the law of categorical judgment (corrected)" (p. 125). the purpose of this comment is to point out that the law can be corrected in many different ways, leading to substantially different equations. the different versions have different consequences for the predicted distributions of the responses and, hence, for fitting real data. some of these consequences are unexpected and sometimes undesirable. researchers should be aware of the different possibilities as they may lead to pronouncedly different accounts of given data.
robust object tracking via online multiple instance metric learning abstract visual tracking, in essence, deals with non-stationary image streams that change over time. while most existing algorithms are able to track objects well in controlled environments, they usually fail in the presence of significant variation of the object’s appearance or surrounding illumination. one reason for such failures is that many algorithms employ fixed appearance models of the target. such models are trained using only appearance data available before tracking begins, which in practice limits the range of appearances that are modeled, and ignores the large volume of information (such as shape changes or specific lighting conditions) that becomes available during tracking. in this paper, we present a tracking method that incrementally learns a low-dimensional subspace representation, efficiently adapting online to changes in the appearance of the target. the model update, based on incremental algorithms for principal component analysis, includes two important features: a method for correctly updating the sample mean, and a forgetting factor to ensure less modeling power is expended fitting older observations. both of these features contribute measurably to improving overall tracking performance. numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm in indoor and outdoor environments where the target objects undergo large changes in pose, scale, and illumination.
dynamic bilateral trading in networks in a wide range of markets, individual buyers and sellers often trade through intermediaries, who determine prices via strategic considerations. typically, not all buyers and seller shave access to the same intermediaries, and they trade at correspondingly different prices that reflect their relative amounts of power in the market. we model this phenomenon using a game in which buyers, sellers, and traders engage in trade on a graph that represents the access each buyer and seller has to the traders. in this model, traders set prices strategically, and then buyers and sellers react to the prices they are offered. we show that the resulting game always has a subgame perfect nash equilibrium, and that all equilibria lead to an efficient (i.e. socially optimal) allocation of goods. we extend these results to a more general type of matching market, such as one finds in the matching ofjob applicants and employers. finally, we consider how the profits obtained by the traders depend on the underlying graph -- roughly, a trader cancommand a positive profit if and only if it has an "essential" connection in the network structure, thus providing a graph-theoretic basis for quantifying the amount of competition among traders. our work differs from recent studies of how price is affected by network structure through our modeling of price-setting as a strategic activity carried out by a subset of agents in the system, rather than studying prices set via competitive equilibrium or by a truthful mechanism.
greedy term selection for document classification with given minimal precision abstract a significant problem in many information filtering systems is the dependence on the user for the creation and maintenance of a user profile, which describes the user's interests. newsweeder is a netnews-filtering system that addresses this problem by letting the user rate his or her interest level for each article being read (1-5), and then learning a user profile based on these ratings. this paper describes how newsweeder accomplishes this task, and examines the alternative learning methods used. the results show that a learning algorithm based on the minimum description length (mdl) principle was able to raise the percentage of interesting articles to be shown to users from 14% to 52% on average. further, this performance significantly outperformed (by 21%) one of the most successful techniques in information retrieval (ir), term-frequency/inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) weighting.
opposition of carbohydrate in a mouth-rinse solution to the detrimental effect of mouth rinsing during cycling time trials. there is a great demand for perceptual effort ratings in order to better understand man at work. such ratings are important complements to behavioral and physiological measurements of physical performance and work capacity. this is true for both theoretical analysis and application in medicine, human factors, and sports. perceptual estimates, obtained by psychophysical ratio-scaling methods, are valid when describing general perceptual variation, but category methods are more useful in several applied situations when differences between individuals are described. a presentation is made of ratio-scaling methods, category methods, especially the borg scale for ratings of perceived exertion, and a new method that combines the category method with ratio properties. some of the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are discussed in both theoretical-psychophysical and psychophysiological frames of reference.
face shape recovery and recognition using a surface gradient based statistical model in this paper, a new technique for modeling textured 3d faces is introduced. 3d faces can either be generated automatically from one or more photographs, or modeled directly through an intuitive user interface. users are assisted in two key problems of computer aided face modeling. first, new face images or new 3d face models can be registered automatically by computing dense one-to-one correspondence to an internal face model. second, the approach regulates the naturalness of modeled faces avoiding faces with an “unlikely” appearance. starting from an example set of 3d face models, we derive a morphable face model by transforming the shape and texture of the examples into a vector space representation. new faces and expressions can be modeled by forming linear combinations of the prototypes. shape and texture constraints derived from the statistics of our example faces are used to guide manual modeling or automated matching algorithms. we show 3d face reconstructions from single images and their applications for photo-realistic image manipulations. we also demonstrate face manipulations according to complex parameters such as gender, fullness of a face or its distinctiveness.
significant blockade of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases by mgcd516 (sitravatinib), a novel small molecule inhibitor, shows potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of sarcoma purpose the purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with one of 10 different subtypes of advanced sarcoma. patients and methods eligible patients were treated daily with imatinib dosed at 300 mg twice a day (for body-surface area > or = 1.5 m(2)). the primary end point was response (clinical benefit response [cbr]), defined as complete (cr) or partial response (pr) at 2 months, or stable disease, cr, or pr at 4 months. rules for early termination within each disease type were based on a bayesian hierarchical probability model (bhm) accounting for correlation of the responses of the 10 subtypes. available tissue samples were analyzed for molecules within the kit/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) signal transduction pathway. results one hundred eighty-five assessable patients with one of 10 subtypes of sarcoma were treated. one cr and three prs were achieved. a cbr was achieved in 28 patients treated overall and by subtype: two angiosarcomas (n = 16), 0 ewing (n = 13), one fibrosarcoma (n = 12), six leiomyosarcomas (n = 29), seven liposarcomas (n = 31), three malignant fibrous histiocytomas (n = 30), five osteosarcomas (n = 27), one malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor (n = 7), 0 rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), and three synovial sarcomas (n = 22). variable expression and mutations within the kit/pdgfr pathway were observed. conclusion this is the first phase ii study of a new agent in sarcoma to include sufficient patients with each of the common histologic subtypes to permit generalizable conclusions. the bhm is an effective method for studying rare diseases and their subtypes, when it is reasonable to assume that their response rates are exchangeable. although rare dramatic responses were seen, imatinib is not an active agent in advanced sarcoma in these subtypes.
identification of porcine rotavirus-like genotype p[6] strains in taiwanese children. abstract the belgian rotavirus strain b4106, isolated from a child with gastroenteritis, was previously found to have vp7 (g3), vp4 (p[14]), and nsp4 (a genotype) genes closely related to those of lapine rotaviruses, suggesting a possible lapine origin or natural reassortment of strain b4106. to investigate the origin of this unusual strain, the gene sequences encoding vp1, vp2, vp3, vp6, nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5/6 were also determined. to allow comparison to a lapine strain, the 11 double-stranded rna segments of a european g3p[14] rabbit rotavirus strain 30/96 were also determined. the complete genome similarity between strains b4106 and 30/96 was 93.4% at the nucleotide level and 96.9% at the amino acid level. all 11 genome segments of strain b4106 were closely related to those of lapine rotaviruses and clustered with the lapine strains in phylogenetic analyses. in addition, sequence analyses of the nsp5 gene of strain b4106 revealed that the altered electrophoretic mobility of nsp5, resulting in a super-short pattern, was due to a gene rearrangement (head-to-tail partial duplication, combined with two short insertions and a deletion). altogether, these findings confirm that a rotavirus strain with an entirely lapine genome complement was able to infect and cause severe disease in a human child.
improved insulin sensitivity, preserved beta cell function and improved whole-body glucose metabolism after low-dose growth hormone replacement therapy in adults with severe growth hormone deficiency: a pilot study context insulin interacts with the gh-igf system by a reciprocal regulation of igf-binding proteins (igfbp) and gh, which in turn regulate insulin sensitivity via bioactive igf-i. this network is linked to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases.   objective we evaluated the effect of glucose and insulin on igfbp-1-4, particularly igfbp-2, in the regulation of bioactive igf-i and its relation to insulin resistance.   setting the study was conducted at an endocrinology center.   research design and methods twenty-four healthy subjects (12 men; aged 21-72 yr; body mass index 25.9 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) and 19 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (igt; eight men; aged 26-71 yr; body mass index 28.9 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2)) were prospectively studied using oral glucose tolerance test and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.   results during the clamp, insulin decreased igf-i bioactivity in both igt subjects and controls (-16.2 +/- 2.8 and -13.9 +/- 3.3%, respectively; p < 0.01). in addition, insulin increased igfbp-2 and gh and decreased igfbp-1 and -4 but did not alter total igf-i, igf-ii, or igfbp-3 levels. during the oral glucose tolerance test, gh and igfbp-1 were markedly suppressed. subjects with igt showed more pronounced insulin resistance and lower gh, igfbp-1, and igfbp-2 levels (p < 0.05). in multiple regression analysis, igfbp-2 was an independent predictor of insulin sensitivity (beta = 0.36, p < 0.05) and igf-i bioactivity (beta = -0.5, p < 0.05).   conclusions our data indicate that insulin acutely decreases igf-i bioactivity through differential modulation of igfbps. furthermore, igfbp-2 plays a central role in the insulin-igf system cross talk and is closely linked to insulin resistance, thereby providing a further explanation for its association with the metabolic syndrome.
quantitative stereological estimations of structural patterns of the glandular tree in benign hyperplasia of prostate the application of assumption‐free, unbiased stereological techniques for estimation of the volume‐weighted mean nuclear volume, nuclear v̄v, from vertical sections of benign and malignant nuclear aggregates in melanocytic skin tumours is described. combining sampling of nuclei with uniform probability in a physical disector and cavalieri's direct estimator of volume, the unbiased, number‐weighted mean nuclear volume, nuclear v̄n, of the same benign and malignant nuclear populations is also estimated. having obtained estimates of nuclear volume in both the volume‐and number distribution of volume, a detailed investigation of nuclear size variability is possible. benign and malignant nuclear populations show approximately the same relative variability with regard to nuclear volume, and the presented data are compatible with a simple size transformation from the smaller benign nuclei to the larger malignant nuclei. finally, the variance in the volume distribution of nuclear volume is estimated by shape‐independent estimates of the volume‐weighted second moment of the nuclear volume, ***v̄2v, using both a manual and a computer‐assisted approach. the working procedure for the description of 3‐d size variability within benign and malignant nuclear populations can for all practical purposes be reduced to 2‐d measurement of nuclear profile areas. these new powerful stereological estimators of nuclear volume and nuclear size variability provide an attractive approach to quantitative and reproducible malignancy grading of cancers.
clinical performance and management outcomes with the decisiondx-um gene expression profile test in a prospective multicenter study uveal (ocular) melanoma is an aggressive cancer that often forms undetectable micrometastases before diagnosis of the primary tumor. these micrometastases later multiply to generate metastatic tumors that are resistant to therapy and are uniformly fatal. we have previously identified a gene expression profile derived from the primary tumor that is extremely accurate for identifying patients at high risk of metastatic disease. development of a practical clinically feasible platform for analyzing this expression profile would benefit high-risk patients through intensified metastatic surveillance, earlier intervention for metastasis, and stratification for entry into clinical trials of adjuvant therapy. here, we migrate the expression profile from a hybridization-based microarray platform to a robust, clinically practical, pcr-based 15-gene assay comprising 12 discriminating genes and three endogenous control genes. we analyze the technical performance of the assay in a prospective study of 609 tumor samples, including 421 samples sent from distant locations. we show that the assay can be performed accurately on fine needle aspirate biopsy samples, even when the quantity of rna is below detectable limits. preliminary outcome data from the prospective study affirm the prognostic accuracy of the assay. this prognostic assay provides an important addition to the armamentarium for managing patients with uveal melanoma, and it provides a proof of principle for the development of similar assays for other cancers.
processing sparql queries over distributed rdf graphs computations performed by graph algorithms are data driven, and require a high degree of random data access. despite the great progresses made in disk technology, it still cannot provide the level of efficient random access required by graph computation. on the other hand, memory-based approaches usually do not scale due to the capacity limit of single machines. in this paper, we introduce trinity, a general purpose graph engine over a distributed memory cloud. through optimized memory management and network communication, trinity supports fast graph exploration as well as efficient parallel computing. in particular, trinity leverages graph access patterns in both online and offline computation to optimize memory and communication for best performance. these enable trinity to support efficient online query processing and offline analytics on large graphs with just a few commodity machines. furthermore, trinity provides a high level specification language called tsl for users to declare data schema and communication protocols, which brings great ease-of-use for general purpose graph management and computing. our experiments show trinity's performance in both low latency graph queries as well as high throughput graph analytics on web-scale, billion-node graphs.
oncolnc: linking tcga survival data to mrnas, mirnas, and lncrnas various cancer genome projects are underway to identify novel mutations that drive tumorigenesis. while these screens will generate large data sets, the majority of identified missense changes are likely to be innocuous passenger mutations or polymorphisms. as a result, it has become increasingly important to develop computational methods for distinguishing functionally relevant mutations from other variations. we previously developed an algorithm, and now present the web application, canpredict (http://www.canpredict.org/ or http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/research/genentech/canpredict/), to allow users to determine if particular changes are likely to be cancer-associated. the impact of each change is measured using two known methods: sorting intolerant from tolerant (sift) and the pfam-based logr.e-value metric. a third method, the gene ontology similarity score (goss), provides an indication of how closely the gene in which the variant resides resembles other known cancer-causing genes. scores from these three algorithms are analyzed by a random forest classifier which then predicts whether a change is likely to be cancer-associated. canpredict fills an important need in cancer biology and will enable a large audience of biologists to determine which mutations are the most relevant for further study.
unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders: a randomized controlled trial. the hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs) is the most widely used scale for patient selection and follow-up in research studies of treatments of depression. despite extensive study of the reliability and validity of the total scale score, the psychometric characteristics of the individual items have not been well studied. in the only reliability study to report agreement on individual items using a test-retest interview method, most of the items had only fair or poor agreement. because this is due in part to variability in the way the information is obtained to make the various rating distinctions, the structured interview guide for the hdrs (sigh-d) was developed to standardize the manner of administration of the scale. a test-retest reliability study conducted on a series of psychiatric inpatients demonstrated that the use of the sigh-d results in a substantially improved level of agreement for most of the hdrs items.
a corpus-based semantic kernel for text classification by using meaning values of terms in conventional text categorization algorithms, documents are symbolized as “bag of words” (bow) with the fact that documents are supposed to be independent from each other. while this approach simplifies the models, it ignores the semantic information between terms of each document. in this study, we develop a novel method to measure semantic similarity based on higher-order dependencies between documents. we propose a kernel for support vector machines (svm) algorithm using these dependencies which is called higher-order semantic kernel. with the aim of presenting comparative performance of higher-order semantic kernel we performed many experiments not only with our algorithm but also with existing traditional first-order kernels such as polynomial kernel, radial basis function kernel, and linear kernel. the experiments using higher-order semantic kernel on several well-known datasets show that classification performance improves significantly over the first-order methods.
maintenance of antifracture efficacy over 10 years with strontium ranelate in postmenopausal osteoporosis background strontium ranelate, a new oral drug shown to reduce vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, was studied in the treatment of peripheral osteoporosis (tropos) study to assess its efficacy and safety in preventing nonvertebral fractures also.   methods strontium ranelate (2 g/d) or placebo were randomly allocated to 5091 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in a double-blind placebo-controlled 5-yr study with a main statistical analysis over 3 yr of treatment.   findings in the entire sample, relative risk (rr) was reduced by 16% for all nonvertebral fractures (p = 0.04), and by 19% for major fragility fractures (hip, wrist, pelvis and sacrum, ribs and sternum, clavicle, humerus) (p = 0.031) in strontium ranelate-treated patients in comparison with the placebo group. among women at high risk of hip fracture (age > or = 74 yr and femoral neck bone mineral density t score < or = -3, corresponding to -2.4 according to nhanes reference) (n = 1977), the rr reduction for hip fracture was 36% (p = 0.046). rr of vertebral fractures was reduced by 39% (p < 0.001) in the 3640 patients with spinal x-rays and by 45% in the subgroup without prevalent vertebral fracture. strontium ranelate increased bone mineral density throughout the study, reaching at 3 yr (p < 0.001): +8.2% (femoral neck) and +9.8% (total hip). incidence of adverse events (aes) was similar in both groups.   conclusion this study shows that strontium ranelate significantly reduces the risk of all nonvertebral and in a high-risk subgroup, hip fractures over a 3-yr period, and is well tolerated. it confirms that strontium ranelate reduces vertebral fractures. strontium ranelate offers a safe and effective means of reducing the risk of fracture associated with osteoporosis.
resources snapshot model for concurrent transactions in multi-core processors the authors present a compile-time scheduling heuristic called dynamic level scheduling, which accounts for interprocessor communication overhead when mapping precedence-constrained, communicating tasks onto heterogeneous processor architectures with limited or possibly irregular interconnection structures. this technique uses dynamically-changing priorities to match tasks with processors at each step, and schedules over both spatial and temporal dimensions to eliminate shared resource contention. this method is fast, flexible, widely targetable, and displays promising performance. >
reciprocal inhibition and slow calcium decay in perigeniculate interneurons explain changes of spontaneous firing of thalamic cells caused by cortical inactivation the cortico-thalamic influence on spontaneous and visually evoked activity of single cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate (lgn) and perigeniculate (pgn) nuclei were examined in unanesthetized cats with pretrigeminal brainstem transections by means of reversible cooling of cortical areas 17 and 18. the spatio-temporal characteristic of cells' rfs was tested with light spot randomly presented at different points along the receptive field axis. the cessation of cortical input decreased spontaneous activity of most of the lgn cells (64%; as compared to 36% with increased background firing). similarly, their visually evoked responses were reduced (70% cells; compared to 24% with increased response) and extent of central excitatory domains diminished. in contrast, the majority of pgn neurons increased their spontaneous activity (62%; compared to 38% with decreased firing rate). cortical cooling resulted also in a decrease of the on and off central responses of most pgn cells (55%; as compared to 20% with increased responses). the described effects were more pronounced within the population of cells in x than in y pathway. although the removal of descending cortical excitation disturbed the balance of activity within the network of thalamic cells the gain of the geniculate relay was preserved. we conclude that the main role exerted by the cortico-thalamic pathway serves facilitation of the ascending retino-cortical flow of visual information at the level of lateral geniculate nucleus.
weekend‐free scheduled ivf/icsi procedures and single embryo transfer do not reduce live‐birth rates in a general infertile population we used a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (buserelin) and human menopausal gonadotrophin (hmg) for superovulation for in-vitro fertilization (ivf) in 143 patients. the patients were prospectively allocated to two balanced groups. in one group (47 patients) human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) was given when the three largest follicles were greater than or equal to 17 mm in diameter, with consistent levels of plasma oestradiol (standard group). in the second group (96 patients), hcg injection was delayed by 24 h (delayed group). in the delayed group of patients, proportionately more had clinical pregnancies (52.1% versus 34.0%). these results suggest that ivf patients will benefit from delayed administration of hcg. the traditional criteria for hcg administration should be changed when buserelin is used.
biological analysis of herbal medicines used for the treatment of liver diseases. a sensitive and specific hplc method was developed to analyze baicalin in rat plasma. the author had compared the pharmacokinetics of baicalin after oral administration of hljdt decoction or pure baicalin in mcao and sham-operated rats. all the rats were divided into two groups, mcao and sham-operated rats. each group contained two subgroups: hljdt decoction and pure baicalin subgroup. the hljdt subgroup oral administration of hljdt decoction extract 10.00 g/kg according to body weight (containing baicalin 400.00 mg/kg according to body weight), the pure baicalin subgroup received a gavages at a dosage of baicalin 400.00 mg/kg according to body weight too. the pharmacokinetics parameters were analyzed by kinetica. the results indicated that the pharmacokinetics of baicalin in rat plasma was non-linear and there were significant differences between different groups. no matter in mcao or sham-operated rats, pure baicalin had shown better absorption than hljdt decoction. whether administration of pure baicalin or hljdt decoction, the mcao rats show better, quicker absorption of baicalin than sham-operated rats. it was good for baicalin to exert pharmacological effects on healed cerebrovascular diseases. the method had been applied successfully to pharmacokinetics of baicalin in rat plasma after oral administration of pure baicalin or hljdt decoction.
hiv-1 subtype c-infected individuals maintaining high viral load as potential targets for the “test-and-treat” approach to reduce hiv transmission background:estimation of hiv incidence rates is important for timing interventions, planning prevention studies, and monitoring the epidemic. this requires accurate estimation of the “recency period” (also known as the “window period”) between seroconversion and achievement of specific detectable levels of anti-hiv antibody titers, such as the standardized optical density (sod) in the early phase of hiv-1 infection. methods:to obtain a better understanding of interpatient variation of the recency period, prospective measurements of antiviral antibody titers in the early phase of hiv-1 subtype c infection were quantified by vironostika-ls. time of seroconversion was estimated by fiebig staging. results:the profiles of sod values during the first year of infection commonly showed slow initial increase followed by a more rapid increase, although in some patients, sod values increased rapidly soon after seroconversion. using an sod cutoff of 1.0, the average duration of the recency period in subtype c infection in the local epidemic in botswana was estimated to be 151 days (95% confidence interval: 130 to 172 days) post seroconversion. the recency period was significantly associated (p = 0.007) with the level of viral replication during the first 2-3 months post seroconversion. reduction of sod values after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (art) was a dominant pattern in antiretroviral drug (arv)-treated subjects. conclusions:our data suggest that hiv incidence estimation based on sensitive/less sensitive enzyme immunoassay cross-sectional testing could be potentially improved by incorporation of viral load levels at the time of detection of a recent infection.
the conversion to metered-dose inhaler with valved holding chamber to administer inhaled albuterol: a pediatric hospital experience. the aim of this study was to compare albuterol delivery in a neonatal ventilated lung model, using three delivery methods: 1) jet nebulizer; 2) chlorofluorocarbon‐pressurized metered dose inhaler (cfc‐mdi) actuated into an ace® spacer; and 3) hydrofluoroalkane‐pressurized mdi (hfa‐mdi) actuated into an ace® spacer. the bench model consisted of a mechanically ventilated infant test lung with ventilator settings to simulate a very low birth weight neonate with moderate lung disease. albuterol solution (0.5%) was nebulized at the humidifier and temperature port, 125 cm and 30 cm from the y‐piece, respectively. albuterol metered dose inhalers (mdis) were actuated into an ace® spacer that was tested in two positions: 1) inline between the endotracheal (et) tube and the y‐piece; and 2) attached to the et tube and administered by manual ventilation. albuterol was collected on a filter at the distal end of the et tube and was quantitatively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography.
bayesian inference on random simple graphs with power law degree distributions we introduce adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. the method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. the method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. the hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. some connections to related algorithms, on which adam was inspired, are discussed. we also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. empirical results demonstrate that adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. finally, we discuss adamax, a variant of adam based on the infinity norm.
effect of compression on sensor-fingerprint based camera identification the article explains how photo-response nonuniformity (prnu) of imaging sensors can be used for a variety of important digital forensic tasks, such as device identification, device linking, recovery of processing history, and detection of digital forgeries. the prnu is an intrinsic property of all digital imaging sensors due to slight variations among individual pixels in their ability to convert photons to electrons. consequently, every sensor casts a weak noise-like pattern onto every image it takes. this pattern, which plays the role of a sensor fingerprint, is essentially an unintentional stochastic spread-spectrum watermark that survives processing, such as lossy compression or filtering. this tutorial explains how this fingerprint can be estimated from images taken by the camera and later detected in a given image to establish image origin and integrity. various forensic tasks are formulated as a two-channel hypothesis testing problem approached using the generalized likelihood ratio test. the performance of the introduced forensic methods is briefly illustrated on examples to give the reader a sense of the performance.
embedded effort indicators on the california verbal learning test – second edition (cvlt–ii): an attempted cross-validation this study determined whether performance patterns on the california verbal learning test-ii (cvlt-ii) could differentiate participants with traumatic brain injury (tbi) showing adequate effort from those with mild tbi exhibiting poor effort using a case-control design. the tbi group consisted of 124 persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). the poor effort group consisted of 77 persons with mild head injury who were involved in litigation (lg) and failed at least one stand-alone symptom validity measure (svt) and also either a second svt or an effort indicator embedded within a standard clinical test. a total of 18 cvlt-ii variables were investigated using bayesian model averaging (bma) for logistic regression to determine which variables best differentiated the groups. the cvlt-ii variables having the most support were long-delay free recall, total recognition discriminability (d′), and total recall discriminability.
use of corticosteroids in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis* objectives to consider methods and related evidence for evaluating bias in non-randomised intervention studies.   data sources systematic reviews and methodological papers were identified from a search of electronic databases; handsearches of key medical journals and contact with experts working in the field. new empirical studies were conducted using data from two large randomised clinical trials.   methods three systematic reviews and new empirical investigations were conducted. the reviews considered, in regard to non-randomised studies, (1) the existing evidence of bias, (2) the content of quality assessment tools, (3) the ways that study quality has been assessed and addressed. (4) the empirical investigations were conducted generating non-randomised studies from two large, multicentre randomised controlled trials (rcts) and selectively resampling trial participants according to allocated treatment, centre and period.   results in the systematic reviews, eight studies compared results of randomised and non-randomised studies across multiple interventions using meta-epidemiological techniques. a total of 194 tools were identified that could be or had been used to assess non-randomised studies. sixty tools covered at least five of six pre-specified internal validity domains. fourteen tools covered three of four core items of particular importance for non-randomised studies. six tools were thought suitable for use in systematic reviews. of 511 systematic reviews that included non-randomised studies, only 169 (33%) assessed study quality. sixty-nine reviews investigated the impact of quality on study results in a quantitative manner. the new empirical studies estimated the bias associated with non-random allocation and found that the bias could lead to consistent over- or underestimations of treatment effects, also the bias increased variation in results for both historical and concurrent controls, owing to haphazard differences in case-mix between groups. the biases were large enough to lead studies falsely to conclude significant findings of benefit or harm. four strategies for case-mix adjustment were evaluated: none adequately adjusted for bias in historically and concurrently controlled studies. logistic regression on average increased bias. propensity score methods performed better, but were not satisfactory in most situations. detailed investigation revealed that adequate adjustment can only be achieved in the unrealistic situation when selection depends on a single factor.   conclusions results of non-randomised studies sometimes, but not always, differ from results of randomised studies of the same intervention. non-randomised studies may still give seriously misleading results when treated and control groups appear similar in key prognostic factors. standard methods of case-mix adjustment do not guarantee removal of bias. residual confounding may be high even when good prognostic data are available, and in some situations adjusted results may appear more biased than unadjusted results. although many quality assessment tools exist and have been used for appraising non-randomised studies, most omit key quality domains. healthcare policies based upon non-randomised studies or systematic reviews of non-randomised studies may need re-evaluation if the uncertainty in the true evidence base was not fully appreciated when policies were made. the inability of case-mix adjustment methods to compensate for selection bias and our inability to identify non-randomised studies that are free of selection bias indicate that non-randomised studies should only be undertaken when rcts are infeasible or unethical. recommendations for further research include: applying the resampling methodology in other clinical areas to ascertain whether the biases described are typical; developing or refining existing quality assessment tools for non-randomised studies; investigating how quality assessments of non-randomised studies can be incorporated into reviews and the implications of individual quality features for interpretation of a review's results; examination of the reasons for the apparent failure of case-mix adjustment methods; and further evaluation of the role of the propensity score.
interactive exploration of large photo libraries next generation environments will change the way people work and live as they will provide new advances in areas ranging from remote work and education, e-commerce, gaming to information-on-demand. in many of these applications intelligent interpretation of multimedia data such as image, video and audio resources is necessary. in this paper we present an effective approach to handling image repositories providing the user with an intuitive interface of visualising and browsing large collections of pictures. based on the idea of similarity-based organisation of images where images that are visually similar are located close to each other in visualisation space, images are projected onto a sphere with which the user can interact. rotating the sphere reveals images of different colours while tilting operations focus on brighter or darker images. large image collections are handled through a hierarchical approach that brings up similar, previously hidden, images when zooming in on an area. furthermore, the way images are organised can be interactively changed by the user. our next generation browsing environment has been successfully tested on a large database of several thousand images.
a noise-adaptive method for detection of brief episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation a novel method for qrst cancellation during atrial fibrillation (af) is introduced for use in recordings with two or more leads. the method is based on an echo state neural network which estimates the time-varying, nonlinear transfer function between two leads, one lead with atrial activity and another lead without, for the purpose of canceling ventricular activity. the network has different sets of weights that define the input, hidden, and output layers, of which only the output set is adapted for every new sample to be processed. the performance is evaluated on ecg signals, with simulated f-waves added, by determining the root mean square error between the true f-wave signal and the estimated signal, as well as by evaluating the dominant af frequency. when compared to average beat subtraction (abs), being the most widely used method for qrst cancellation, the performance is found to be significantly better with an error reduction factor of 0.24-0.43, depending on f-wave amplitude. the estimates of dominant af frequency are considerably more accurate for all f-wave amplitudes than the af estimates based on abs. the novel method is particularly well suited for implementation in mobile health systems where monitoring of af during extended time periods is of interest.
ectobiotic and endobiotic bacteria associated with eutreptiella sp. isolated from long island sound. the increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. we describe a new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. the core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. this algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. we used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. the reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. for example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcl sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. this new method is implemented in the phyml program, which is freely available on our web page: http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/maas/.
apc/c-mediated multiple monoubiquitination provides an alternative degradation signal for cyclin b1 proteasomes, the primary mediators of ubiquitin–protein conjugate degradation, are regulated through complex and poorly understood mechanisms. here we show that usp14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, can inhibit the degradation of ubiquitin–protein conjugates both in vitro and in cells. a catalytically inactive variant of usp14 has reduced inhibitory activity, indicating that inhibition is mediated by trimming of the ubiquitin chain on the substrate. a high-throughput screen identified a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human usp14. treatment of cultured cells with this compound enhanced degradation of several proteasome substrates that have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. usp14 inhibition accelerated the degradation of oxidized proteins and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. enhancement of proteasome activity through inhibition of usp14 may offer a strategy to reduce the levels of aberrant proteins in cells under proteotoxic stress.
population coding with motion energy filters: the impact of correlations a motion sequence may be represented as a single pattern in x-y-t space; a velocity of motion corresponds to a three-dimensional orientation in this space. motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. we discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. the outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. these responses are then fed into an opponent stage. energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena.
cultural adaptation of a peer-led lifestyle intervention program for diabetes prevention in india: the kerala diabetes prevention program (k-dpp) resumen los comportamientos que ponen en riesgo la salud humana, como el sedentarismo y la dietainadecuada son muy resistentes al cambio. la mayoria de teorias sociocognitivas consideranque la intencion es el mejor predictor del cambio; sin embargo, se sabe que las personas sonmuy inconsistentes con sus intenciones y que la discrepancia entre intencion y accion es funcionde multiples factores. por ejemplo, el surgimiento de barreras o tentaciones inesperadas queevitan a la persona transitar de las intenciones a las acciones significa que existen factores masproximales que deben facilitar el cambio. la autoeficacia percibida y la planificacion estrategicason factores postintencionales que han sido identificados en la literatura como facilitadores de latransicion de la intencion al cambio comportamental y constituyen dimensiones fundamentalespara reducir la brecha intencion/comportamiento. el modelo procesual de accion en salud(del ingles, “health action process approach”, abreviado como “hapa”) propone distinguirentre: a) procesos de motivacion preintencionales que conducen a las intenciones, y b) procesosvolitivos postintencionales que conducen al cambio efectivo en el comportamiento. este articuloanaliza los resultados de siete investigaciones que versan sobre el papel de los mediadoresvolitivos en la iniciacion y adherencia a cinco comportamientos de salud, a saber: ejerciciofisico, autoexamen de mama, uso del cinturon de seguridad, dieta saludable y limpieza bucalcon hilo dental. el objetivo del trabajo es valorar, basado en los siete estudios, la universalidady la aplicabilidad del modelo hapa y su replicabilidad en diferentes comportamientosde salud, en distintos puntos de medicion y en muestras de diferentes culturas y paises. abstract health-compromising behaviors such as physical inactivity and poor dietary habits aredifficult to change. most social-cognitive theories assume that an individual’s intention to change is the best direct predictor of actual change. but people often do not behave inaccordance with their intentions. this discrepancy between intention and behavior is due toseveral reasons. for example, unforeseen barriers could emerge, or people might give in totemptations. therefore, intention needs to be supplemented by other, more proximal factorsthat might compromise or facilitate the translation of intentions into action. some of thesepostintentional factors have been identified, such as perceived self-efficacy and strategicplanning. they help to bridge the intention–behavior gap. the health action process approach(hapa) suggests a distinction between (a) preintentional motivation processes that lead toa behavioral intention, and (b) postintentional volition processes that lead to the actualhealth behavior. in this article, seven studies are reported that examine the role of volitionalmediators in the initiation and adherence to five health behaviors: physical exercise, breastself-examination, seat belt use, dietary behaviors, and dental flossing. the general aim is toexamine the applicability of the hapa and its universality by replicating it across differenthealth behaviors, based on various measures, time spans, and samples from different countries.
haptic pictures, blindness, and tactile beliefs: preliminary analysis of a case-study several behavioural studies have shown that early-blind persons possess superior tactile skills. since neurophysiological data show that early-blind persons recruit visual as well as somatosensory cortex to carry out tactile processing (cross-modal plasticity), blind persons' sharper tactile skills may be related to cortical re-organisation resulting from loss of vision early in their life. to examine the nature of blind individuals' tactile superiority and its implications for cross-modal plasticity, we compared the tactile performance of congenitally totally blind, low-vision and sighted children on raised-line picture identification test and re-test, assessing effects of task familiarity, exploratory strategy and memory recognition. what distinguished the blind from the other children was higher memory recognition and higher tactile encoding associated with efficient exploration. these results suggest that enhanced perceptual encoding and recognition memory may be two cognitive correlates of cross-modal plasticity in congenital blindness.
rnacontext: a new method for learning the sequence and structure binding preferences of rna-binding proteins an rna molecule, particularly a long-chain mrna, may exist as a population of structures. further more, multiple structures have been demonstrated to play important functional roles. thus, a representation of the ensemble of probable structures is of interest. we present a statistical algorithm to sample rigorously and exactly from the boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures. the forward step of the algorithm computes the equilibrium partition functions of rna secondary structures with recent thermodynamic parameters. using conditional probabilities computed with the partition functions in a recursive sampling process, the backward step of the algorithm quickly generates a statistically representative sample of structures. with cubic run time for the forward step, quadratic run time in the worst case for the sampling step, and quadratic storage, the algorithm is efficient for broad applicability. we demonstrate that, by classifying sampled structures, the algorithm enables a statistical delineation and representation of the boltzmann ensemble. applications of the algorithm show that alternative biological structures are revealed through sampling. statistical sampling provides a means to estimate the probability of any structural motif, with or without constraints. for example, the algorithm enables probability profiling of single-stranded regions in rna secondary structure. probability profiling for specific loop types is also illustrated. by overlaying probability profiles, a mutual accessibility plot can be displayed for predicting rna:rna interactions. boltzmann probability-weighted density of states and free energy distributions of sampled structures can be readily computed. we show that a sample of moderate size from the ensemble of an enormous number of possible structures is sufficient to guarantee statistical reproducibility in the estimates of typical sampling statistics. our applications suggest that the sampling algorithm may be well suited to prediction of mrna structure and target accessibility. the algorithm is applicable to the rational design of small interfering rnas (sirnas), antisense oligonucleotides, and trans-cleaving ribozymes in gene knock-down studies.
iga subclass switch recombination in human mucosal and systemic immune compartments ataxia‐telangiectasia (a‐t) and nijmegen breakage syndrome (nbs) are recessive genetic diseases with similar cellular phenotypes that are caused by mutations in the recently described atm (encoding atm) and nbs1 (encoding p95) genes, respectively. both disorders are accompanied by immunodeficiency in a majority of patients, but the mechanism involved has as yet not beenestablished. we demonstrate that in cells from a‐t patients, the switch (s) recombination junctions are aberrant and characterized by a strong dependence on short sequence homologies and devoid of normally occurring mutations around the breakpoint. a low number of s fragments were generated in cells from nbs patients and showed only limited dependence on sequence identity and mutation frequencies were similar to those observed in normal controls. we propose that atm and p95 are both involved in the final step(s) in class switch recombination with related, but disparate, functional roles. thus, the general pathway involved in dna repair also has a major influence on the immunoglobulin isotype switching process.
genomewide comparison and novel ncrnas of aquificales backgroundorthology analysis is an important part of data analysis in many areas of bioinformatics such as comparative genomics and molecular phylogenetics. the ever-increasing flood of sequence data, and hence the rapidly increasing number of genomes that can be compared simultaneously, calls for efficient software tools as brute-force approaches with quadratic memory requirements become infeasible in practise. the rapid pace at which new data become available, furthermore, makes it desirable to compute genome-wide orthology relations for a given dataset rather than relying on relations listed in databases.resultsthe program proteinortho described here is a stand-alone tool that is geared towards large datasets and makes use of distributed computing techniques when run on multi-core hardware. it implements an extended version of the reciprocal best alignment heuristic. we apply proteinortho to compute orthologous proteins in the complete set of all 717 eubacterial genomes available at ncbi at the beginning of 2009. we identified thirty proteins present in 99% of all bacterial proteomes.conclusionsproteinortho significantly reduces the required amount of memory for orthology analysis compared to existing tools, allowing such computations to be performed on off-the-shelf hardware.

comparison of evidence‐based practice between physicians and nurses: a national survey of regional hospitals in taiwan physicians have to deal with a broad range of medical problems in clinical practice, thus making the timely acquisition of relevant information is a critical skill for physicians to improve care quality. the current national study investigates how physicians search for medical information and analyses how they use online medical databases. a structured questionnaire survey was conducted, with 457 valid returns collected. internet-based resources (web portals, online databases, and electronic journals) were more often accessed by physicians to look for medical information than personal or paper ones. almost universally, physicians have accessed online databases. medline was the most frequently accessed database. furthermore, physicians under 50 years old tended to access online databases more often than their elder colleagues (or = 5.27, 95% ci = 1.96–14.14 for age <35; or = 4.68, 95% ci = 2.07–10.60 for ages 35–50). in addition, physicians with faculty position were more often accessing online databases (or = 3.32; 95% ci = 1.75–6.30). other factors — including clinical experience, administrative position, gender, academic degree, and professional specialty — carried no significant differences. these data may assist in determining how to promote the use of online evidence-based medical information for clinical services.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
personal and environmental correlates of active travel and physical activity in a deprived urban population background physical inactivity is a global concern, but diverse physical activity measures in use prevent international comparisons. the international physical activity questionnaire (ipaq) was developed as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity.   methods between 1997 and 1998, an international consensus group developed four long and four short forms of the ipaq instruments (administered by telephone interview or self-administration, with two alternate reference periods, either the "last 7 d" or a "usual week" of recalled physical activity). during 2000, 14 centers from 12 countries collected reliability and/or validity data on at least two of the eight ipaq instruments. test-retest repeatability was assessed within the same week. concurrent (inter-method) validity was assessed at the same administration, and criterion ipaq validity was assessed against the csa (now mti) accelerometer. spearman's correlation coefficients are reported, based on the total reported physical activity.   results overall, the ipaq questionnaires produced repeatable data (spearman's rho clustered around 0.8), with comparable data from short and long forms. criterion validity had a median rho of about 0.30, which was comparable to most other self-report validation studies. the "usual week" and "last 7 d" reference periods performed similarly, and the reliability of telephone administration was similar to the self-administered mode.   conclusions the ipaq instruments have acceptable measurement properties, at least as good as other established self-reports. considering the diverse samples in this study, ipaq has reasonable measurement properties for monitoring population levels of physical activity among 18- to 65-yr-old adults in diverse settings. the short ipaq form "last 7 d recall" is recommended for national monitoring and the long form for research requiring more detailed assessment.
enhanced fast retina keypoint descriptor effective and efficient generation of keypoints from an image is a well-studied problem in the literature and forms the basis of numerous computer vision applications. established leaders in the field are the sift and surf algorithms which exhibit great performance under a variety of image transformations, with surf in particular considered as the most computationally efficient amongst the high-performance methods to date. in this paper we propose brisk1, a novel method for keypoint detection, description and matching. a comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets reveals brisk's adaptive, high quality performance as in state-of-the-art algorithms, albeit at a dramatically lower computational cost (an order of magnitude faster than surf in cases). the key to speed lies in the application of a novel scale-space fast-based detector in combination with the assembly of a bit-string descriptor from intensity comparisons retrieved by dedicated sampling of each keypoint neighborhood.
efficient microaggregation techniques for large numerical data volumes microaggregation is a clustering problem with minimum size constraints on the resulting clusters or groups; the number of groups is unconstrained and the within-group homogeneity should be maximized. in the context of privacy in statistical databases, microaggregation is a well-known approach to obtaining anonymized versions of confidential microdata. optimally solving microaggregation on multivariate data sets is known to be difficult (np-hard). therefore, heuristic methods are used in practice. this paper presents a new heuristic approach to multivariate microaggregation, which provides variable-sized groups (and thus higher within-group homogeneity) with a computational cost similar to the one of fixed-size microaggregation heuristics.
exhaustive expansion: a novel technique for analyzing complex data generated by higher-order polychromatic flow cytometry experiments purpose to measure the cd8+ t-cell response to a melanoma peptide vaccine and to compare an every-2-weeks with an every-3-weeks vaccination schedule.   patients and methods thirty hla-a2-positive patients with resected stage i to iii melanoma were randomly assigned to receive vaccinations every 2 weeks (13 vaccines) or every 3 weeks (nine vaccines) for 6 months. the synthetic, modified gp100 peptide, g209-2m, and a control peptide, hpv16 e7, were mixed in incomplete freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously. peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained before and after vaccination by leukapheresis were analyzed using a fluorescence-based hla/peptide-tetramer binding assay and cytokine flow cytometry.   results vaccination induced an increase in peptide-specific t cells in 28 of 29 patients. the median frequency of cd8+ t cells specific for the g209-2m peptide increased markedly from 0.02% before to 0.34% after vaccination (p <.0001). eight patients (28%) exhibited peptide-specific cd8+ t-cell frequencies greater than 1%, including two patients with frequencies of 4.96% and 8.86%, respectively. interferon alfa-2b-treated patients also had significant increases in tetramer-binding cells (p <.0001). no difference was observed between the every-2-weeks and the every-3-weeks vaccination schedules (p =.59).   conclusion flow cytometric analysis of hla/peptide-tetramer binding cells was a reliable means of quantifying the cd8+ t-cell response to peptide immunization. this assay may be suitable for use in future trials to optimize different vaccination strategies. concurrent interferon treatment did not inhibit the development of a peptide-specific immune response and vaccination every 2 weeks, and every 3 weeks produced similar results.
neuronal diversity in gabaergic long-range projections from the hippocampus the connections between the cortex and the striatum are critically involved in control and execution of voluntary movements. here we focused on the expression of calcium binding protein parvalbumin (pv) in the corticostriatal pathway. injections of fluorogold into the striatum gave rise to retrograde labeling of pv‐positive neurons in the retrosplenial cortex and somatosensory cortex. the pv‐positive corticostriatal projection neurons were mainly found in layer v, but occasionally seen in layers ii, iii, and vi. the pv immunoreactivity of retrogradely labeled cells was weaker than that of nonlabeled cells. although it was rather difficult to analyze the morphology of fluorogold‐labeled neurons that exhibited pv immunoreactivity, some of them showed distinct apical dendrites and were considered pyramidal cells. the main target of pv‐positive cortical afferents was the caudal striatum on the ipsilateral side. next, we tested whether pv‐positive corticostriatal projection neurons were gabaergic or not, because previous studies emphasized that pv was an important marker for cortical gabaergic neurons. unexpectedly, we found that the majority of pv‐positive corticostriatal projection neurons were glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad)‐negative, while some of them were gad‐positive. finally, an anterograde tracer phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (pha‐l) injection into the somatosensory cortex resulted in many pv‐positive corticostriatal terminals that were vesicular glutamate transporter 1‐positive, whereas some of the pv‐positive pha‐l‐labeled terminals were gad‐positive. our results provide anatomical evidence for expression of pv in glutamatergic and gabaergic corticostriatal pathway in mice and suggest that a subset of cortical afferents may exert some inhibitory influence on striatal activity. j. comp. neurol. 477:188–201, 2004. © 2004 wiley‐liss, inc.
hand bacterial communities vary across two different human populations. exposure to specific airborne bacteria indoors is linked to infectious and noninfectious adverse health outcomes. however, the sources and origins of bacteria suspended in indoor air are not well understood. this study presents evidence for elevated concentrations of indoor airborne bacteria due to human occupancy, and investigates the sources of these bacteria. samples were collected in a university classroom while occupied and when vacant. the total particle mass concentration, bacterial genome concentration, and bacterial phylogenetic populations were characterized in indoor, outdoor, and ventilation duct supply air, as well as in the dust of ventilation system filters and in floor dust. occupancy increased the total aerosol mass and bacterial genome concentration in indoor air pm10 and pm2.5 size fractions, with an increase of nearly two orders of magnitude in airborne bacterial genome concentration in pm10. on a per mass basis, floor dust was enriched in bacterial genomes compared to airborne particles. quantitative comparisons between bacterial populations in indoor air and potential sources suggest that resuspended floor dust is an important contributor to bacterial aerosol populations during occupancy. experiments that controlled for resuspension from the floor implies that direct human shedding may also significantly impact the concentration of indoor airborne particles. the high content of bacteria specific to the skin, nostrils, and hair of humans found in indoor air and in floor dust indicates that floors are an important reservoir of human-associated bacteria, and that the direct particle shedding of desquamated skin cells and their subsequent resuspension strongly influenced the airborne bacteria population structure in this human-occupied environment. inhalation exposure to microbes shed by other current or previous human occupants may occur in communal indoor environments.
equivalences between git quotients of landau-ginzburg b-models the existence of a certain type of equivalence between triangulated categories of singularities for varieties of different dimensions is proved. this class of equivalences generalizes the so-called knorrer periodicity. as a consequence, equivalences between the categories of d-branes of type b on landau-ginzburg models of different dimensions are obtained.
identification of secondary structure elements in intermediate-resolution density maps. abstract comparative analysis of capsid protein structures in the eukaryote-infecting herpesviruses (herpesviridae) and the prokaryote-infecting tailed dna bacteriophages (caudovirales) revealed a characteristic fold that is restricted to these two virus lineages and is indicative of common ancestry. this fold not only serves as a major architectural element in capsid stability but also enables the conformational flexibility observed during viral assembly and maturation. on the basis of this and other emerging relationships, it seems increasingly likely that the very diverse collection of extant viruses may have arisen from a relatively small number of primordial progenitors.
traffic matrices: balancing measurements, inference and modeling the traffic matrix of a telecommunications network is an essential input for any kind of network design and capacity planning decision. in this paper we address a debate surrounding traffic matrix estimation, namely whether or not the costs of direct measurement are too prohibitive to be practical. we examine the feasibility of direct measurement by outlining the computation, communication and storage overheads, for traffic matrices defined at different granularity levels. we illustrate that today's technology, that necessitates a centralized solution, does indeed incur prohibitive costs. we explain what steps are necessary to move towards fully distributed solutions, that would drastically reduce many overheads. however, we illustrate that the basic distributed solution, in which flow monitors are on all the time, is excessive and unnecessary. by discovering and taking advantage of a key stability property underlying traffic matrices, we are able to propose a new scheme that is distributed and relies only on a limited use of flow measurement data. our approach is simple, accurate and scalable. furthermore, it significantly reduces the overheads above and beyond the basic distributed solution. our results imply that direct measurement of traffic matrices should become feasible in the near future.
a fuzzy simple additive weighting system under group decision-making for facility location selection with objective/subjective attributes abstract the location selection of distribution center (dc) is one of the most important decision issues for logistics managers. owing to vague concept frequently represented in decision data, a new multiple criteria decision-making method is proposed to solve the distribution center location selection problem under fuzzy environment. in the proposed method, the ratings of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are described by linguistic variables which can be expressed in triangular fuzzy numbers. the final evaluation value of each dc location is also expressed in a triangular fuzzy number. by calculating the difference of final evaluation value between each pair of dc locations, a fuzzy preference relation matrix is constructed to represent the intensity of the preferences of one plant location over another. and then, a stepwise ranking procedure is proposed to determine the ranking order of all candidate locations. finally, a numerical example is solved to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method at the end of this paper.
when abc becomes acb. backgroundplant mads box proteins play important roles in a plethora of developmental processes. in order to regulate specific sets of target genes, mads box proteins dimerize and are thought to assemble into multimeric complexes. in this study a large-scale yeast three-hybrid screen is utilized to provide insight into the higher-order complex formation capacity of the arabidopsis mads box family. sepallata3 (sep3) has been shown to mediate complex formation and, therefore, special attention is paid to this factor in this study.resultsin total, 106 multimeric complexes were identified; in more than half of these at least one sep protein was present. besides the known complexes involved in determining floral organ identity, various complexes consisting of combinations of proteins known to play a role in floral organ identity specification, and flowering time determination were discovered. the capacity to form this latter type of complex suggests that homeotic factors play essential roles in down-regulation of the mads box genes involved in floral timing in the flower via negative auto-regulatory loops. furthermore, various novel complexes were identified that may be important for the direct regulation of the floral transition process. a subsequent detailed analysis of the apetala3, pistillata, and sep3 proteins in living plant cells suggests the formation of a multimeric complex in vivo.conclusionsoverall, these results provide strong indications that higher-order complex formation is a general and essential molecular mechanism for plant mads box protein functioning and attribute a pivotal role to the sep3 'glue' protein in mediating multimerization.
angiotensin stimulates tgf-beta1 and clusterin in the hydronephrotic neonatal rat kidney. chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (uuo) in early development activates the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and leads to profound renal vasoconstriction, renal growth arrest, and interstitial fibrosis. to investigate the response of the at1 and at2 subtypes of the angiotensin ii (ang ii) receptors to uuo, sprague-dawley rats underwent uuo or control sham operation in the first 48 h of life and were studied 1-28 days later. renal mrna for renin, at1 and at2 receptor, and receptor binding and distribution were determined. in contrast to controls, renin mrna increased from 14 to 28 days in the obstructed kidney. after ipsilateral uuo, at1 mrna was suppressed at 1 day, but had increased compared with controls at 28 days. at2 receptor mrna fell rapidly in all kidneys from 1 to 3 days of age, after which it remained undetectable. compared with the intact opposite kidney, at2 mrna was suppressed in the obstructed kidney 1 day after uuo. compared with controls, at1 and at2 receptor binding was decreased by ipsilateral uuo at 1 day, whereas at1 binding was increased at 28 days. renal ang ii content was increased in the obstructed compared with the intact opposite kidney 28 days after uuo. in view of the increase in renal renin and angiotensin ii production resulting from uuo, increased renal at1 mrna and receptor binding are likely to contribute to the vasoconstriction and interstitial fibrosis of the neonatal kidney after prolonged uuo.
differences in pregnancy outcomes and characteristics between insulin- and diet-treated women with gestational diabetes objective we examined whether selected indexes of insulin sensitivity derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (is(ogtt)) or fasting glucose/insulin levels (is(quicki) and is(homa)) can be used to predict insulin sensitivity in women before and during pregnancy.   research design and methods a 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (5 mmol/l glucose, 40 mu. m(-2). min(-1) insulin) and a 120-min oral glucose tolerance test (75 g load pregravid, 100 g pregnant) were repeated on 15 women (10 with normal glucose tolerance [ngt] and 5 with gestational diabetes mellitus [gdm]) pregravid and during both early (12-14 weeks) and late (34-36 weeks) pregnancy. an index of insulin sensitivity derived from the clamp (is(clamp)) was obtained from glucose infusion rates adjusted for change in fat-free mass and endogenous glucose production measured using [6,6(-2)h(2)]glucose.   results univariate analysis using combined groups and periods of pregnancy resulted in significant correlations between is(clamp) and is(ogtt) (r(2) = 0.74, p < 0.0001), is(quicki) (r(2) = 0.64, p < 0.0001), and is(homa) (r(2) = 0.53, p < 0.0001). the is(ogtt) provided a significantly better correlation (p < 0.0001) than either is(quicki) or is(homa.) multivariate analysis showed a significant group effect (p < 0.0003) on the prediction model, and separate equations were developed for the ngt (r(2) = 0.64, p < 0.0001) and gdm (r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.0001) groups. when subdivided by period of pregnancy, the correlation between is(clamp) and is(ogtt) pregravid was r(2) = 0.63 (p = 0.0002), during early pregnancy was r(2) = 0.80 (p < 0.0001), and during late pregnancy was r(2) = 0.64 (p = 0.0002).   conclusions estimates of insulin sensitivity from the is(ogtt) during pregnancy were significantly better than from fasting glucose and insulin values. however, separate prediction equations are necessary for pregnant women with ngt and women with gdm.
integrating multi-objective genetic algorithm based clustering and data partitioning for skyline computation we propose to extend database systems by a skyline operation. this operation filters out a set of interesting points from a potentially large set of data points. a point is interesting if it is not dominated by any other point. for example, a hotel might be interesting for somebody traveling to nassau if no other hotel is both cheaper and closer to the beach. we show how ssl can be extended to pose skyline queries, present and evaluate alternative algorithms to implement the skyline operation, and show how this operation can be combined with other database operations, e.g., join.
validation of lay‐administered mental health assessments in a large army national guard cohort the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (m.i.n.i.) is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by psychiatrists and clinicians in the united states and europe, for dsm-iv and icd-10 psychiatric disorders. with an administration time of approximately 15 minutes, it was designed to meet the need for a short but accurate structured psychiatric interview for multicenter clinical trials and epidemiology studies and to be used as a first step in outcome tracking in nonresearch clinical settings. the authors describe the development of the m.i.n.i. and its family of interviews: the m.i.n.i.-screen, the m.i.n.i.-plus, and the m.i.n.i.-kid. they report on validation of the m.i.n.i. in relation to the structured clinical interview for dsm-iii-r, patient version, the composite international diagnostic interview, and expert professional opinion, and they comment on potential applications for this interview.
genomic prediction using dart-seq technology for yellowtail kingfish seriola lalandi thirteen nuclear-encoded dinucleotide microsatellites were characterized from a genomic dna library of greater amberjack, seriola dumerili. the microsatellites include 12 perfect-repeat motifs and one imperfect-repeat motif. the number of alleles at the 13 microsatellites among a sample of 29 fish ranged from 3 to 25; gene diversity (expected heterozygosity) ranged from 0.296 to 0.948, while observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.276 to 0.897. following bonferroni correction, genotypes at all 13 microsatellites fit expectations of hardy-weinberg equilibrium. one pairwise comparison of microsatellites deviated significantly from expectations of genotypic equilibrium, suggesting that these two microsatellites may be linked. greater amberjack support commercial and recreational fisheries along both the atlantic and gulf coasts of the u.s. and represent a species with potential for worldwide aquaculture. the microsatellites developed will be useful for conservation and population genetic studies of ‘wild’ and domesticated populations of greater amberjack.
improving hierarchical image classification with merged cnn architectures recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. in this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the dense convolutional network (densenet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. whereas traditional convolutional networks with l layers have l connections&#x2014;one between each layer and its subsequent layer&#x2014;our network has l(l+1)/2 direct connections. for each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. densenets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. we evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (cifar-10, cifar-100, svhn, and imagenet). densenets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance. code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liuzhuang13/densenet.
no ocular involvement in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy attr v30m domino liver recipients backgroundautonomic neuropathy is a common and serious complication of diabetes. early detection is essential to enable appropriate interventional therapy and management. dynamic pupillometry has been proposed as a simpler and more sensitive tool to detect subclinical autonomic dysfunction. the aim of this study was to investigate pupil responsiveness in diabetic subjects with and without cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (can) using dynamic pupillometry in two sets of experiments.methodsduring the first experiment, one flash was administered and the pupil response was recorded for 3 s. in the second experiment, 25 flashes at 1-s interval were administered and the pupil response was recorded for 30 s. several time and pupil-iris radius-related parameters were computed from the acquired data. a total of 24 diabetic subjects (16 without and 8 with can) and 16 healthy volunteers took part in the study.resultsour results show that diabetic subjects with and without can have sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, evidenced by diminished amplitude reflexes and significant smaller pupil radius. it suggests that pupillary autonomic dysfunction occurs before a more generalized involvement of the autonomic nervous system, and this could be used to detect early autonomic dysfunction.conclusionsdynamic pupillometry provides a simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive tool to screen high-risk diabetic patients for diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
switchgrass genomic diversity, ploidy, and evolution: novel insights from a network-based snp discovery protocol backgroundrelatively little information is available for sequence variation in the pig. we previously used a combination of short read (25 base pair) high-throughput sequencing and reduced genomic representation to discover > 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in cattle, but the current lack of complete genome sequence limits this approach in swine. longer-read pyrosequencing-based technologies have the potential to overcome this limitation by providing sufficient flanking sequence information for assay design. swine snp were discovered in the present study using a reduced representation of 450 base pair (bp) porcine genomic fragments (approximately 4% of the swine genome) prepared from a pool of 26 animals relevant to current pork production, and a gs-flx instrument producing 240 bp reads.resultsapproximately 5 million sequence reads were collected and assembled into contigs having an overall observed depth of 7.65-fold coverage. the approximate minor allele frequency was estimated from the number of observations of the alternate alleles. the average coverage at the snps was 12.6-fold. this approach identified 115,572 snps in 47,830 contigs. comparison to partial swine genome draft sequence indicated 49,879 snp (43%) and 22,045 contigs (46%) mapped to a position on a sequenced pig chromosome and the distribution was essentially random. a sample of 176 putative snps was examined and 168 (95.5%) were confirmed to have segregating alleles; the correlation of the observed minor allele frequency (maf) to that predicted from the sequence data was 0.58.conclusionthe process was an efficient means to identify a large number of porcine snp having high validation rate to be used in an ongoing international collaboration to produce a highly parallel genotyping assay for swine. by using a conservative approach, a robust group of snps were detected with greater confidence and relatively high maf that should be suitable for genotyping in a wide variety of commercial populations.
non–aids-defining cancer mortality: emerging patterns in the late haart era the increased life expectancy among hiv-infected persons treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (art), risk behaviors, and co-morbidities associated with art place hiv-infected persons at risk for non-hiv-related causes of death. we used the san francisco hiv/aids registry to identify deaths that occurred from january 1996 through december 2011. temporal trends in aids- and non-aids-related mortality rates, the proportion of underlying and contributory causes of death, and the ratio of observed deaths in the study population to expected number of deaths among california men aged 20-79 (standardized mortality ratio [smr]) of underlying causes of death were examined. a total of 5338 deaths were identified. the annual aids-related death rate (per 100 deaths) declined from 10.8 in 1996 to 0.9 in 2011 (p<0.0001), while the annual death rate from non-aids-related causes declined from 2.1 in 1996 to 0.9 in 2011 (p<0.0001). the proportion of deaths due to all types of heart disease combined, all non-aids cancers combined, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse, drug overdose, suicide and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased significantly over time. the smrs for liver diseased decreased significantly over time but remained elevated. our data highlight the importance of age-related causes of death as well as deaths from causes that are, at least in part, preventable.
redox biology of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv: protein-protein interaction between glgb and whib1 involves exchange of thiol-disulfide whib family of protein is emerging as one of the most fascinating group and is implicated in stress response as well as pathogenesis via their involvement in diverse cellular processes. surprisingly, available in vivo data indicate an organism specific physiological role for each of these proteins. the whib proteins have four conserved cysteine residues where two of them are present in a c-x-x-c motif. in thioredoxins and similar proteins, this motif works as an active site and confers thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity to the protein. the recombinant whib1/rv3219 was purified in a single step from escherichia coli using ni(2+)-nta affinity chromatography and was found to exist as a homodimer. mass spectrometry of whib1 shows that the four cysteine residues form two intramolecular disulfide bonds. using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as a measure of redox state, the redox potential of whib1 was calculated as -236+/-2mv, which corresponds to the redox potential of many cytoplasmic thioredoxin-like proteins. whib1 catalyzed the reduction of insulin disulfide thus clearly demonstrating that it functions as a protein disulfide reductase. present study for the first time suggests that whib1 may be a part of the redox network of mycobacterium tuberculosis through its involvement in thiol-disulfide exchange with other cellular proteins.
intake of fruit and vegetables and risk of bladder cancer: a dose–response meta-analysis of observational studies background & aims the association between fruit and vegetable intake and colorectal cancer risk has been investigated by many studies but is controversial because of inconsistent results and weak observed associations. we summarized the evidence from cohort studies in categorical, linear, and nonlinear, dose-response meta-analyses.   methods we searched pubmed for studies of fruit and vegetable intake and colorectal cancer risk that were published until the end of may 2010. we included 19 prospective studies that reported relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals (cis) of colorectal cancer-associated with fruit and vegetable intake. random effects models were used to estimate summary relative risks.   results the summary relative risk for the highest vs the lowest intake was 0.92 (95% ci: 0.86-0.99) for fruit and vegetables combined, 0.90 (95% ci: 0.83-0.98) for fruit, and 0.91 (95% ci: 0.86-0.96) for vegetables (p for heterogeneity=.24, .05, and .54, respectively). the inverse associations appeared to be restricted to colon cancer. in linear dose-response analysis, only intake of vegetables was significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk (summary relative risk=0.98; 95% ci: 0.97-0.99), per 100 g/d. however, significant inverse associations emerged in nonlinear models for fruits (pnonlinearity<.001) and vegetables (pnonlinearity=.001). the greatest risk reduction was observed when intake increased from very low levels of intake. there was generally little evidence of heterogeneity in the analyses and there was no evidence of small-study bias.   conclusions based on meta-analysis of prospective studies, there is a weak but statistically significant nonlinear inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and colorectal cancer risk.
quality estimation of english-hindi machine translation systems translation of a text in one's local language can be very time consuming. same text which needs to be translated, appears several times. this is very taxing for the translator, as she has to provide repetitive translations for same text. this paper shows the design of a translation tool which provided automatic translations for completely or partially reappearing text. this makes the task of the translator much easier, as she has to concentrate only on the text with no similarities.
erk is involved in the reorganization of somatosensory cortical maps in adult rats submitted to hindlimb unloading the aim of this study was to determine if a prolonged period (7 or 14 days) of hypodynamia-hypokinesia (hh) affects the conduction of afferent input and the cortical and spinal responsiveness. acute recordings of cortical and spinal somatosensory evoked potentials (seps) were performed after stimulation of the sciatic nerve in control rats and in rats submitted to 7 or 14 days of hh. hh was obtained by unloading the hindquarter. hh induced some subtle modifications in the sep characteristics. latency was increased for the spinal and cortical seps after 7 days of hh, and restored after 14 days of hh. a decrease in the amplitude was observed after 14 days of hh for the cortical sep only. at the end of the experiment, the compound action potential of the sciatic nerve was recorded in vitro in order to evaluate the mean conduction velocity. results indicate that the nerve velocity was reduced after 14 days of hh. the results also suggest that sensory conduction and/or cortical and spinal excitability are changed after hh.
effectiveness of hiv risk reduction interventions among men who have sex with men in china: a systematic review and meta-analysis abstract a randomized controlled study evaluated an internet-based hiv behavioral intervention for men who have sex with men (msm). hong kong chinese men aged ≥18 having engaged in oral or anal msm behaviors in the last six months were randomly allocated into the intervention (n=140) and the control groups (n=140). participants were interviewed anonymously at the baseline and after six months. interventions included periodic hiv information dissemination, monitoring of risk behaviors and interactive feedback, online peer counseling and provision of a hotline. the control group only received some educational materials. efficacy of the intervention was not supported as no statistically significant between-group differences in background characteristics, hiv risk behaviors and perceptions were observed both at the baseline and after the 6-month period. effectiveness of online interventions should not be taken for granted and evidence-based approach is warranted.
role of the carotid bodies in chemosensory ventilatory responses in the anesthetized mouse. we examined the reliability of whole-body plethysmography (wbp) for determining the ventilatory volume in mice. the degree of agreement of tidal volume (vt) determined consecutively by wbp with that by direct plethysmography (dp) or pneumotachography (pt) was analyzed using urethane-anesthetized young male 129/sv mice. between wbp and dp, the mean difference of vt was 0.000 ml with a 95% confidence interval of -0.003 to 0.002, whereas that between wbp and pt was 0.000 ml (-0.004 to 0.003). the limits of agreement, or mean +/- 2sd of the difference, were -0.008 and 0.008 ml in wbp vs. dp, and -0.011 and 0.010 ml in wbp vs. pt. these values were 5.1-6.6% of the average vt (0.157 ml in wbp and dp, and 0.165 ml in wbp and pt). thus, vt can be determined by wbp without any bias and with a systemic error of less than 7% of that measured by the other direct methods examined. through applying wbp to conscious 129/sv and 129/svj-icr hybrid mice, we further studied the effects of differences in mouse strain, age and sex on respiratory rate (f) and minute volume (v = vt.f), and their reflex changes in responses to systemic hypoxia and hypercapnia. v was significantly greater in young (10-16 weeks old) male 129/sv than in young male 129/svj-icr hybrids (139 +/- 11 and 73 +/- 8 ml/min/100 g, respectively), while the pattern of reflex responses was similar. in aged (32-44 weeks old) male 129/sv, the basal level of v and its reflex increases were all diminished as compared to those in their young counter parts. however, we were unable to find significant differences between aged male and female 129/sv mice. in conclusion, wbp is a useful and reliable method to determine ventilatory parameters in conscious and anesthetized mice. furthermore, there are considerable strain- and age-related differences in baseline ventilation and reflex responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
geometric distortions affect face recognition in chimpanzees (pan troglodytes) and monkeys (macaca mulatta) faces are salient stimuli for primates that rely predominantly on visual cues for recognizing conspecifics and maintaining social relationships. while previous studies have shown similar face discrimination processes in chimpanzees and humans, data from monkeys are unclear. therefore, three studies examined face processing in rhesus monkeys using the face inversion effect, a fractured face task, and an individual recognition task. unlike chimpanzees and humans, the monkeys showed a general face inversion effect reflected by significantly better performance on upright compared to inverted faces (conspecifics, human and chimpanzees faces) regardless of the subjects' expertise with those categories. fracturing faces alters first- and second-order configural manipulations whereas previous studies in chimpanzees showed selective deficits for second-order configural manipulations. finally, when required to individuate conspecific's faces, i.e., matching two different photographs of the same conspecific, monkeys showed poor discrimination and repeated training. these results support evolutionary differences between rhesus monkeys and hominoids in the importance of configural cues and their ability to individuate conspecifics' faces, suggesting a lack of face expertise in rhesus monkeys.
nursing home social services directors who report thriving at work purpose weak empirical evidence exists showing that nursing home staffing levels influence quality of care. we propose that weak findings have resulted in many prior analyses because research models have underspecified the labor composition needed to influence care processes that, in turn, influence quality of care. in this analysis, we specified the nursing home labor composition by using staff stability, use of agency staff, and professional staff mix, in addition to staffing levels.   design and methods data used in this investigation came from surveys of nursing home administrators (n = 6,005); nursing home compare; the online survey, certification and reporting data; and the area resource file. staffing characteristics, quality indicators, facility, and market information from these data sources were all measured in 2004.   results the regression analyses showed that staffing levels alone were weakly associated with the six quality measures examined. however, when the regression models were more fully specified (by including agency staff, stability, and professional staff mix), staffing levels were generally associated with the quality measures (i.e., 15 of the 18 staffing coefficients were significant).   implications simply adding more staff may be a necessary but not sufficient means of improving nursing home quality. some accounting for agency staff, stability, and professional staff mix is also needed.
mapping protein binding sites on the biomolecular corona of nanoparticles. the search for understanding the interactions of nanosized materials with living organisms is leading to the rapid development of key applications, including improved drug delivery by targeting nanoparticles, and resolution of the potential threat of nanotechnological devices to organisms and the environment. unless they are specifically designed to avoid it, nanoparticles in contact with biological fluids are rapidly covered by a selected group of biomolecules to form a corona that interacts with biological systems. here we review the basic concept of the nanoparticle corona and its structure and composition, and highlight how the properties of the corona may be linked to its biological impacts. we conclude with a critical assessment of the key problems that need to be resolved in the near future.
enhancing masculinity by slandering homosexuals two experiments tested whether the relation between automatic prejudice and discriminatory behavior is moderated by 2 conscious processes: conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the authors predicted that, when both conscious processes are deactivated, automatic prejudice would elicit discriminatory behavior. when either of the 2 processes is activated, behavioral bias would be eliminated. the authors assessed participants' automatic attitudes toward gay men, conscious beliefs about gender, behavioral control, and interactions with gay confederates. in experiment 1, men's beliefs about gender were heterogeneous, whereas women's beliefs were mostly egalitarian; men's responses supported the predictions, but women's responses did not. in experiment 2, the authors recruited a sample with greater diversity in gender-related beliefs. results showed that, for both sexes, automatic prejudice produced biased behavior in the absence of conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the presence of either conscious process eliminated behavioral bias.
analysis of simian hemorrhagic fever virus proteins and the host cell responses of disease resistant and susceptible primates abstract    as with a number of other viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) has been shown to induce apoptosis, although the mechanism(s) involved remain unknown. in this study we have characterized the apoptotic pathways activated by prrsv infection. prrsv-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis including phosphatidylserine exposure, chromatin condensation, dna fragmentation, caspase activation (including caspase-8, 9, 3), and parp cleavage. dna fragmentation was dependent on caspase activation but blocking apoptosis by a caspase inhibitor did not affect prrsv replication. upregulation of bax expression by prrsv infection was followed by disruption of the mitochondria transmembrane potential, resulting in cytochrome c redistridution to the cytoplasm and subsequent caspase-9 activation. a crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways was demonstrated by dependency of caspase-9 activation on active caspase-8 and by bid cleavage. furthermore, in this study we provide evidence of the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species (ros)-mediated oxidative stress in apoptosis induced by prrsv. our data indicated that cell death caused by prrsv infection involves necrosis as well as apoptosis. in summary, these findings demonstrate mechanisms by which prrsv induces apoptosis and will contribute to an enhanced understanding of prrsv pathogenesis.
effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy for the treatment of catastrophisation in patients with fibromyalgia: a randomised controlled trial objective the aim of this pilot study was to examine the practicality of delivering a package of nonpharmacologic, behavioral-based treatment, previously found to be effective in chronic back pain, to patients with fibromyalgia (fm) and to assess the efficacy of the intervention using a range of outcome measures up to 4 months posttreatment.   methods participants with fm (n = 28) formed a single group for 8 sessions at weekly intervals. each session comprised an education/cognitive-behavioral component, formal relaxation/meditation training, and instruction in a chinese movement therapy (qi gong).   results twenty of 28 subjects completed at least 5 of the 8 sessions. significant improvement was seen in the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire and a range of other outcome measures including tender points and pain threshold. improvement was sustained 4 months after the end of the intervention.   conclusion a simple behavioral intervention using large groups can be administered to subjects with fm and appears to produce sustained benefit in a range of outcomes. controlled trials are currently being planned.
whole-cell maldi-tof mass spectrometry and multilocus sequence analysis in the discrimination of pseudomonas stutzeri populations: three novel genomovars an examination of the results of phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of fragments of the 16s rrna, gyrb and rpod genes, and the discrimination of genomovars based on siderophore diversity within the genus pseudomonas, has added important taxonomic tools in the characterization of pseudomonas stutzeri. eighteen reference strains, nine newly identified hydrocarbon-degrading strains and three strains showing relevant physiological characteristics of p. stutzeri, together with the type strains of four related species, were included in the study. a novel genomovar within the species is described. a summary of the methodology used in these studies and the results of our attempts to define a solid internal subdivision of this important species within the genus pseudomonas are presented and discussed.
forethought in youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: an fmri study of sex-specific differences a 14-min continuous performance test (cpt) requiring a high rate of responding was administered to a probability-weighted random sample of 816 9–17-year-old children drawn from a population of 17,117 children in an ongoing epidemiological and longitudinal study in western north carolina. systematic main effects of improved performance with older age were found in this age range for all variables, including reaction time (rt), rt standard error, errors of omission, errors of commission, and signal detection parameters (d' and β). significant gender main effects included more impulsive errors, less variability, and faster rt by males, with no interactions between age and gender. there were no main effects of ethnicity or interactions of ethnicity with age and/or gender. large main effects of interstimulus interval (isi; 1, 2, or 4-s intervals) and time block were present for most cpt performance measures. the normative data from the cpt should provide a useful framework for interpreting similar data in future studies of child and adolescent psychopathology.
crystal structures of t. b. rhodesiense adenosine kinase complexed with inhibitor and activator: implications for catalysis and hyperactivation this paper reviews the mathematical basis of maximum likelihood. the likelihood function for macromolecular structures is extended to include prior phase information and experimental standard uncertainties. the assumption that different parts of a structure might have different errors is considered. a method for estimating sigma(a) using 'free' reflections is described and its effects analysed. the derived equations have been implemented in the program refmac. this has been tested on several proteins at different stages of refinement (bacterial alpha-amylase, cytochrome c', cross-linked insulin and oligopeptide binding protein). the results derived using the maximum-likelihood residual are consistently better than those obtained from least-squares refinement.
ambiguous loss in families of children with autism spectrum disorders the ces-d scale is a short self-report scale designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. the items of the scale are symptoms associated with depression which have been used in previously validated longer scales. the new scale was tested in household interview surveys and in psychiatric settings. it was found to have very high internal consistency and adequate test- retest repeatability. validity was established by pat terns of correlations with other self-report measures, by correlations with clinical ratings of depression, and by relationships with other variables which support its construct validity. reliability, validity, and factor structure were similar across a wide variety of demographic characteristics in the general population samples tested. the scale should be a useful tool for epidemiologic studies of de pression.
regulation of myocardial fatty acid oxidation by substrate supply. the contribution of glycolysis and oxidative metabolism to atp production was determined in isolated working hypertrophied hearts perfused with krebs-henseleit buffer containing 3% albumin, 0.4 mm palmitate, 0.5 mm lactate, and 11 mm glucose. glycolysis and glucose oxidation were directly measured by perfusing hearts with [5-3h/u-14c]glucose and by measuring 3h2o and 14co2 production, respectively. palmitate and lactate oxidation were determined by simultaneous measurement of 3h2o and 14co2 in hearts perfused with [9,10-3h]palmitate and [u-14c]lactate. at low workloads (60 mmhg aortic after-load), rates of palmitate oxidation were 47% lower in hypertrophied hearts than in control hearts, but palmitate oxidation remained the primary energy source in both groups, accounting for 55 and 69% of total atp production, respectively. the contribution of glycolysis to atp production was significantly higher in hypertrophied hearts (19%) than in control hearts (7%), whereas that of glucose and lactate oxidation did not differ between groups. during conditions of high work (120 mmhg aortic afterload), the extra atp production required for mechanical function was obtained primarily from an increase in the oxidation of glucose and lactate in both groups. the contribution of palmitate oxidation to overall atp production decreased in hypertrophied and control hearts (to 40 and 55% of overall atp production, respectively) and was no longer significantly depressed in hypertrophied hearts. glycolysis, on the other hand, was accelerated in control hearts to rates seen in the hypertrophied hearts. thus a reduced contribution of fatty acid oxidation to energy production in hypertrophied rat hearts is accompanied by a compensatory increase in glycolysis during low work conditions.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
irg and gbp host resistance factors target aberrant, “non-self” vacuoles characterized by the missing of “self” irgm proteins dendritic cells (dcs) have the striking ability to cross-present exogenous antigens in association with major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i to cd8(+) t cells. however, the intracellular pathways underlying cross-presentation remain ill defined. current models involve cytosolic proteolysis of antigens by the proteasome and peptide import into endoplasmic reticulum (er) or phagosomal lumen by the transporters associated with antigen processing (tap1 and tap2). here, we show that dcs expressed an er-resident 47 kda immune-related gtpase, igtp (irgm3). igtp resides on er and lipid body (lb) membranes where it binds the lb coat component adfp. inactivation of genes encoding for either igtp or adfp led to defects in lb formation in dcs and severely impaired cross-presentation of phagocytosed antigens to cd8(+) t cells but not antigen presentation to cd4(+) t cells. we thus define a new role for lb organelles in regulating cross-presentation of exogenous antigens to cd8(+) t lymphocytes in dcs.
history and fate of a small isolated population of weddell seals at white island, antarctica ldne is a program with a visual basic interface that implements a recently developed bias correction for estimates of effective population size (ne) based on linkage disequilibrium data. the program reads genotypic data in standard formats and can accommodate an arbitrary number of samples, individuals, loci, and alleles, as well as two mating systems: random and lifetime monogamy. ldne calculates separate estimates using different criteria for excluding rare alleles, which facilitates evaluation of data for highly polymorphic markers such as microsatellites. the program also introduces a jackknife method for obtaining confidence intervals that appears to perform better than parametric methods currently in use.
the discourse of sibling violence domestic violence professionals have debated whether all physical assaults by partners should be labeled abuse. this study examined the use of labels such as “abuse,” “victim,” and “battered woman” in a sample of women (n = 78) who had sustained at least one physical assault in their current or most recent relationship. self-labeling followed a differentiating strategy, that is, women experiencing more frequent and more severe assaults were more likely to apply labels. lower partner income, being black, lower relationship commitment, and having ended the relationship also were associated with increased self-labeling. labeling of hypothetical acts followed an inclusive strategy, that is, all assaults were considered abusive. these results suggest that contextual factors influence labeling. prevention and intervention programs may be able to increase their effectiveness by including more situational context in their messages.
quality evaluation of persian nutrition and diet therapy websites webqual is an instrument for assessing the quality of internet sites from the perspective of the customer. earlier versions of webqual focused on information and interaction quality. this paper reports on a new version of webqual that incorporates three quality dimensions: information quality, interaction quality and web site design quality. webqual is applied in the domain of internet auctions and the results are used to assess the reliability of the instrument for assessing the quality of web sites. three auction sites (amazon, ebay and qxl) are evaluated through an intervention that involves buying and selling at auction. the results of the intervention are analyzed quantitatively to assess the validity of the webqual instrument and supplemented by qualitative data that is used to consider the relative merits of the three sites evaluated.
the effects of tio2 nanodot films with rgd immobilization on light-induced cell sheet technology the phenomenon of light-induced cell detachment is reported. mouse calvaria-derived, pre-osteoblastic (mc3t3-e1) cells were cultured on a tio(2) nanodot-coated quartz substrate. after 20 min of uv365 illumination, over 90% of the cells would detach from the surface. moreover, intact cell sheets could be obtained in the same way. it was found that the as-obtained cells showed good viability, and could be used for further culture processes and other applications. also, biocompatibility and safety characterizations indicated that the use of tio(2) nanodots and uv365 illumination was safe for such cell detachment. it is suggested that adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins play key roles in developing cell sheets and ensuring biocompatibility. the present light-induced cell detachment method demonstrates a promising way for rapid cell/cell sheet harvesting.
effects of mechanical properties of muscle and tendon on performance in long distance runners the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of static and dynamic training on the stiffness and blood volume of the human tendon in vivo. ten subjects completed 12 wk (4 days/wk) of a unilateral training program for knee extensors. they performed static training on one side [st; 70% of maximum voluntary contraction (mvc)] and dynamic training on the other side (dt; 80% of one repetition maximum). before and after training, mvc, neural activation level (by interpolated twitch), muscle volume (by magnetic resonance imaging), stiffness of tendon-aponeurosis complex and patella tendon (by ultrasonography), and blood volume of patella tendon (by red laser lights) were measured. both protocols significantly increased mvc (49% for st, 32% for dt; both p < 0.001), neural activation level (9.5% for st, 7.6% for dt; both p < 0.01), and muscle volume (4.5% for st, 5.6% for dt; both p < 0.01). the stiffness of tendon-aponeurosis complex increased significantly after st (55%; p = 0.003) and dt (30%; p = 0.033), while the stiffness of patella tendon increased significantly after st (83%; p < 0.001), but not for dt (p = 0.110). the blood volume of patella tendon increased significantly after dt (47%; p = 0.016), but not for st (p = 0.205). these results implied that the changes in the blood volume of tendon would be related to differences in the effects of resistance training on the tendon properties.
graph theory enables drug repurposing – how a mathematical model can drive the discovery of hidden mechanisms of action this chapter introduces the field of computational scientific discovery and provides a brief overview thereof. we first try to be more specific about what scientific discovery is and also place it in the broader context of the scientific enterprise. we discuss the components of scientific behavior, that is, the knowledge structures that arise in science and the processes that manipulate them. we give a brief historical review of research in computational scientific discovery and discuss the lessons learned, especially in relation to work in data mining that has recently received substantial attention. finally, we discuss the contents of the book and how it fits in the overall framework of computational scientific discovery.
fatigue rating scales critique and recommendations by the movement disorders society task force on rating scales for parkinson's disease objective: to determine whether post lyme syndrome (pls) is antibiotic responsive. methods: the authors conducted a single-center randomized double-masked placebo-controlled trial on 55 patients with lyme disease with persistent severe fatigue at least 6 or more months after antibiotic therapy. patients were randomly assigned to receive 28 days of iv ceftriaxone or placebo. the primary clinical outcomes were improvement in fatigue, defined by a change of 0.7 points or more on an 11-item fatigue questionnaire, and improvement in cognitive function (mental speed), defined by a change of 25% or more on a test of reaction time. the primary laboratory outcome was an experimental measure of csf infection, outer surface protein a (ospa). outcome data were collected at the 6-month visit. results: patients assigned to ceftriaxone showed improvement in disabling fatigue compared to the placebo group (rate ratio, 3.5; 95% ci, 1.50 to 8.03; p = 0.001). no beneficial treatment effect was observed for cognitive function or the laboratory measure of persistent infection. four patients, three of whom were on placebo, had adverse events associated with treatment, which required hospitalization. conclusions: ceftriaxone therapy in patients with pls with severe fatigue was associated with an improvement in fatigue but not with cognitive function or an experimental laboratory measure of infection in this study. because fatigue (a nonspecific symptom) was the only outcome that improved and because treatment was associated with adverse events, this study does not support the use of additional antibiotic therapy with parenteral ceftriaxone in post-treatment, persistently fatigued patients with pls.
phase angle and onodera's prognostic nutritional index in critically ill patients. based on assessment of 200 malnourished cancer patients of digestive organs, a multiparameter index of nutritional status was defined to relating the risk of postoperative complications to base line nutritional status. the linear predictive model relating the risk of operative complication, mortality or both to nutritional status is given by the relation: prognostic nutritional index (pni) = 10 alb. + 0.005 lymph. c., where alb. is serum albumin level (g/100 ml) and lymph. c. is total lymphocytes count/mm3 peripheral blood. when applied prospectively to 189 gastrointestinal surgical patients those who were malnourished and treated by tpn preoperatively, this index provided an accurate, quantitative estimate of operative risk. in general, resection and anastomosis of gastrointestinal tract can be safely practiced when the index is over 45. the same procedure may be dangerous between 45 and 40. in below 40, this kind of operation may be contraindicated. the prognostic nutritional index is useful also to know the prognosis of patients with terminal cancer. despite practicing tpn to cancer patients with near terminal stages, if the pni remains below 40 and total lymphocytes count remains below 1,000/mm3, the patients has high possibility to die within the next two months.
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
leakage-resilient public-key cryptography in the bounded-retrieval model we propose two improvements to the fiat shamir authentication and signature scheme. we reduce the communication of the fiat shamir authentication scheme to a single round while preserving the efficiency of the scheme. this also reduces the length of fiat shamir signatures. using secret keys consisting of small integers we reduce the time for signature generation by a factor 3 to 4. we propose a variation of our scheme using class groups that may be secure even if factoring large integers becomes easy.
turning 21: induction of mir-21 as a key switch in the inflammatory response glucan particles (gps) are hollow, porous 2–4 μm microspheres derived from the cell walls of baker's yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). the 1,3-β-glucan outer shell provides for receptor-mediated uptake by phagocytic cells expressing β-glucan receptors. gps have been used for macrophage-targeted delivery of soluble payloads (dna, sirna, protein, and small molecules) encapsulated inside the hollow gps via core polyplex and layer-by-layer (lbl) synthetic strategies. in this communication, we report the incorporation of nanoparticles as cores inside gps (gp-np) or electrostatically bound to the surface of chemically derivatized gps (np-gp). gp nanoparticle formulations benefit from the drug encapsulation properties of nps and the macrophage-targeting properties of gps. gp nanoparticle formulations were synthesized using fluorescent anionic polystyrene nanoparticles allowing visualization and quantitation of np binding and encapsulation. mesoporous silica nanoparticles (msns) containing the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (dox) were bound to cationic gps. dox-msn-gps efficiently delivered dox into gp phagocytic cells resulting in enhanced dox-mediated growth arrest.
mouse tenm4 is required for mesoderm induction mouse otx2 is a bicoid-class homeobox gene, related to the drosophila orthodenticle (otd) gene. expression of this gene is initially widespread in the epiblast at embryonic day 5.5 but becomes progressively restricted to the anterior end of the embryo at the headfold stage. in flies, loss of function mutations in otd result in deletion of pre-antennal and antennal segments; which leads to the absence of head structures derived from these segments. to study the function of otx2 in mice, we have generated a homeobox deletion mutation in this gene. mice homozygous for this mutation show severe defects in gastrulation and in formation of axial mesoderm and loss of anterior neural tissues. these results demonstrate that otx2 is required for proper development of the epiblast and patterning of the anterior brain in mice, and supports the idea of evolutionary conservation of the function of otd/otx genes in head development in flies and mice.
quorum-sensing-deficient (lasr) mutants emerge at high frequency from a pseudomonas aeruginosa muts strain. we reported recently that the human opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pa14 kills caenorhabditis elegans and that many p. aeruginosa virulence factors (genes) required for maximum virulence in mouse pathogenicity are also required for maximum killing of c. elegans. here we report that among eight p. aeruginosa pa14 tnphoa mutants isolated that exhibited reduced killing of c. elegans, at least five also exhibited reduced virulence in mice. three of the tnphoa mutants corresponded to the known virulence-related genes lasr, gaca, and lema. three of the mutants corresponded to known genes (aefa from escherichia coli, pstp from azotobacter vinelandii, and mtrr from neisseria gonorrhoeae) that had not been shown previously to play a role in pathogenesis, and two of the mutants contained tnphoa inserted into novel sequences. these data indicate that the killing of c. elegans by p. aeruginosa can be exploited to identify novel p. aeruginosa virulence factors important for mammalian pathogenesis.
large‐scale bone mineral histomorphometry – report of a simplified technique this study analyses changes in the bony architecture of the femoral head and neck in osteoarthritis. five osteoarthritic hips were obtained from female patients undergoing total hip replacement and were compared to non‐arthritic control specimens from the dissecting room. analysis was carried out on a coronal bony slice of the femoral head and on a transverse section of the upper femoral neck. the results indicated that in the region of the compressive trabeculae the intertrabecular areas were generally smaller in the osteoarthritic specimens and that the inferior part of the cortex of the femoral neck had thickened. our data thus quantified changes consistent with the thickening of compressive trabeculae reported by others and with thickening of the region of the femoral neck on which they converge. we found less trabecular bone in non‐weight‐bearing regions of the lower femoral head and in the medulla of the upper neck in the osteoarthritic specimens consistent with loss of tensile trabeculae. scanning electron microscopy suggested that bone resorption activity was higher in the subchondral and non‐weight‐bearing regions of the osteoarthritic femoral heads than in the controls. clin. anat. 17:378–391, 2004. © 2004 wiley‐liss, inc.
changes in trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture at peripheral sites associated with 18 months of teriparatide therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis bone strength is a fundamental contributor to fracture risk, and with the recent development of in vivo 3d bone micro-architecture measurements by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, the finite element (fe) analysis may provide a means to assess patient bone strength in the distal radius. the purpose of this study was to determine an appropriate fe procedure to estimate bone strength by comparison with experimental data. models based on a homogeneous tissue modulus or a modulus scaled according to computed tomography attenuation were assessed, and these were solved by linear and non-linear fe analyses to estimate strength. the distal radius from fresh, human cadaver forearms (5 male/5 female, ages 55 to 93) was dissected free and four 9.1 mm sections were cut beginning at the subchondral plate to provide 40 test specimens. the sections were scanned using an in vivo protocol providing 3d image data with an 82 microm voxel size. all specimens were mechanically tested in uniaxial compression, and elastic and yield properties were determined. linear fe analyses were performed on all specimens (n=40), and non-linear analyses using an asymmetric, bilinear yield strain criteria were performed on a sub-sample (n=10) corresponding to the normal clinical measurement site. experimentally determined apparent elastic properties correlated highly with ultimate stress (r2=0.977, p<0.05, n=31) for the 31 specimens tested to failure. subsequently, a linear fe analysis estimating apparent elastic properties also correlated highly with failure, and the correlation was higher when moduli were determined from scaled ct-attenuation values than a homogeneous modulus (r2=0.983 vs. r2=0.972, p<0.05, n=31). a non-linear analysis based on tensile and compressive yield strains of 0.0295 and 0.0493 for homogeneous models, and 0.0127 and 0.0212 for scaled models directly estimated ultimate stress, and correlated highly (r2=0.951 vs. r2=0.937, p<0.05, n=5). the linear relation between stiffness and strength may be unique to radius compressive loading. it supports the use of a linear fe analysis to determine bone strength by regression equations established here. scaled tissue modulus models performed better than homogeneous modulus models, and the advantage of a scaled model is its potential to account for mineralization changes. the combined numerical-experimental procedure for fe model validation on the patient micro-ct technology demonstrated that bone strength can be estimated non-invasively, and this may provide important insight into fracture risk in patient populations.
tlr signaling in mast cells: common and unique features mammalian immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity. furthermore, much evidence has demonstrated that activation of innate immunity is a prerequisite to induction of acquired immunity. this paradigm shift has changed our thinking on the pathogenesis and treatment of infections, immune diseases, allergy, and cancers.
