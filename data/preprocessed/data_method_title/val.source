antifolate drug resistance: novel mutations and haplotype distribution in dhps and dhfr from northeast india as chloroquine resistance spreads across africa, the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) inhibitors pyrimethamine and proguanil are being used as alternative first-line drugs for the treatment and prevention of plasmodium falciparum malaria. resistance to these drugs is conferred by point mutations in parasite dhfr. these point mutations can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, but better methods for sample collection, dna extraction, and a diagnostic pcr are needed to make these assays useful in malaria-endemic areas. here we report methods for collecting fingerstick blood onto filter paper strips that are air-dried, then stored and transported at room temperature. cell lysis and dna extraction are accomplished by boiling in chelex-100. we also report a nested pcr technique that has improved sensitivity and specificity. these procedures readily detect mixed infections of parasites with both sensitive and resistant genotypes (confirmed by direct sequencing) and are reliable at parasite densities less than 250/mm3 in field surveys.
a phase‐variable mechanism controlling the campylobacter jejuni flgr response regulator influences commensalism campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans in developed countries throughout the world. this bacterium frequently promotes a commensal lifestyle in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals including birds and consumption or handling of poultry meats is a prevalent source of c. jejuni for infection in humans. to understand how the bacterium promotes commensalism, we used signature‐tagged transposon mutagenesis and identified 29 mutants representing 22 different genes of c. jejuni strain 81–176 involved in colonization of the chick gastrointestinal tract. among the determinants identified were two adjacent genes, one encoding a methyl‐accepting chemotaxis protein (mcp), presumably required for proper chemotaxis to a specific environmental component, and another gene encoding a putative cytochrome c peroxidase that may function to reduce periplasmic hydrogen peroxide stress during in vivo growth. deletion of either gene resulted in attenuation for growth throughout the gastrointestinal tract. further examination of 10 other putative mcps or mcp‐domain containing proteins of c. jejuni revealed one other required for wild‐type levels of caecal colonization. this study represents one of the first genetic screens focusing on the bacterial requirements necessary for promoting commensalism in a vertebrate host.
dynamic asymmetries in disparity convergence eye movements experiments are described in which monocular accommodation response/stimulus curves were measured with snellen targets over the stimulus range from +1.0 to -5.0 d, using artificial pupils with diameters of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 mm and a constant retinal illuminance of 600 td. the results agree with those of earlier authors in showing a diminished response with smaller pupils. the slopes of the quasi-linear central portions of the response/stimulus curves are well described in terms of a geometrical optical approximation in which the accommodation system works to produce a retinal blur circle whose diameter is a linear function of the dioptric difference between the magnitudes of the stimulus and the accommodative resting state, this blur circle diameter being independent of the pupil diameter. further consideration of diffractive effects suggests that contrast changes in the intermediate spatial frequency components (approximately 5 c/deg) of the retinal image may play a dominant role in guiding the response.
improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
domain-dependent identification of multiword expressions much work on idioms has focused on type identification, i.e., determining whether a sequence of words can form an idiomatic expression. since an idiom type often has a literal interpretation as well, token classification of potential idioms in context is critical for nlp. we explore the use of informative prior knowledge about the overall syntactic behaviour of a potentially-idiomatic expression (type-based knowledge) to determine whether an instance of the expression is used idiomatically or literally (token-based knowledge). we develop unsupervised methods for the task, and show that their performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art supervised techniques.
process and outcomes from a youth-led campaign to address healthy eating in an urban high school objectives we assessed the statewide impact of the 2004 texas public school nutrition policy on foods and beverages served or sold in schools.   methods we collected lunch food production records from 47 schools in 11 texas school districts for the school years before (2003-2004) and after (2004-2005) policy implementation. cafeteria servings of fruit, vegetables (regular and fried), and milk served each day were calculated. twenty-three schools from 5 districts provided records of à la carte sales of candy, chips, desserts, drinks, ice cream, and water. we examined aggregated school-level differences in total items served or sold per day per student between study years.   results school demographics were similar to state data. regardless of district and school size, cafeterias served significantly fewer high-fat vegetable items per student postpolicy (p < .001). postpolicy snack bar sales of large bags of chips were significantly reduced (p = .006), and baked chips sales significantly increased (p = .048).   conclusions school food policy changes have improved foods served or sold to students. it is not known whether improved lunch choices influence consumption for the whole day.
statistical energy potential: reduced representation of dehouck–gilis–rooman function by selecting against decoy datasets we describe predictions made using the rosetta structure prediction methodology for both template‐based modeling and free modeling categories in the seventh critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction. for the first time, aggressive sampling and all‐atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the rosetta@home distributed computing network. template‐based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. free modeling methods gave near‐atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. these results indicate that refinement with an all‐atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions. proteins 2007. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
dextrose prolotherapy: a narrative review of basic science, clinical research, and best treatment recommendations. flaws in the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of randomised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated. the cochrane collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more accurate
visual analytics for evaluating clinical pathways under the umbrella of buzzwords such as “business activity monitoring” (bam) and “business process intelligence” (bpi) both academic (e.g., emit, little thumb, inwolve, process miner, and minson) and commercial tools (e.g., aris ppm, hp bpi, and ilog jviews) have been developed. the goal of these tools is to extract knowledge from event logs (e.g., transaction logs in an erp system or audit trails in a wfm system), i.e., to do process mining. unfortunately, tools use different formats for reading/storing log files and present their results in different ways. this makes it difficult to use different tools on the same data set and to compare the mining results. furthermore, some of these tools implement concepts that can be very useful in the other tools but it is often difficult to combine tools. as a result, researchers working on new process mining techniques are forced to build a mining infrastructure from scratch or test their techniques in an isolated way, disconnected from any practical applications. to overcome these kind of problems, we have developed the prom framework, i.e., an “pluggable” environment for process mining. the framework is flexible with respect to the input and output format, and is also open enough to allow for the easy reuse of code during the implementation of new process mining ideas. this paper introduces the prom framework and gives an overview of the plug-ins that have been developed.
relative influence of meteorological conditions and aerosols on the lifetime of mesoscale convective systems we estimate the extent of upper tropospheric aerosol layers (ut als) surrounding mesoscale convective systems (mcss) and explore the relationships between ut al extent and the morphology, location, and developmental stage of collocated mcss in the tropics. our analysis is based on satellite data collected over equatorial africa, south asia, and the amazon basin between june 2006 and june 2008. we identify substantial variations in the relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport by region and stage of convective development. the most extensive ut als over equatorial africa are associated with mature mcss, while the most extensive ut als over south asia and the amazon are associated with growing mcss. convective aerosol transport over the amazon is weaker than that observed over the other two regions despite similar transport frequencies, likely due to the smaller sizes and shorter mean lifetimes of mcss over the amazon. variations in ut als in the vicinity of tropical mcss are primarily explained by variations in the horizontal sizes of the associated mcss and are largely unrelated to aerosol loading in the lower troposphere. we also identify potentially important relationships with the number of convective cores, vertical wind shear, and convective fraction during the growing and mature stages of mcs development. relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport are relatively weak during the decaying stage of convective development. our results provide an interpretive framework for devising and evaluating numerical model experiments that examine relationships between convective properties and als in the upper troposphere.
impacts from control operations on a recreationally hunted feral swine population at a large military installation in florida summaryin the last decades, wild boar (sus scrofa) distribution has increased world-wide, the iberian peninsula being no exception. the wild boar now inhabits almost the entire iberian territory, where today it is one of the most important big game species. in this paper, for the first time, bag analysis from two ecological different regions are presented and compared to the employed hunting techniques. one represents the well-preserved mediterranean forests of south-western spain, the other, located in the south of portugal, is a farmland with interspersed forest areas. our results indicate a stronger hunting intensity and also a higher wild boar population density in the portuguese study areas. the stronger hunting intensity may result in a younger wild boar population. we also found considerable differences between the shooting techniques used in both regions and those employed in the north-east of the peninsula. it does therefore not seem advisable to directly compare bag statistics from different regions of the iberian peninsula.zusammenfassungin den letzten jahrzehnten hat das wildschwein (sus scrofa) sein vebreitungsgebiet weltweit ausgedehnt. die iberische halbinsel bildet diesbezüglich keine ausnahme. das wildschwein kommt dort gegenwärtig nahezu überall vor und stellt eine der wichtigsten gro\wildarten dar. in dieser arbeit werden erstmals streckenanalysen aus zwei ökologisch unterschiedlichen regionen der iberischen halbinsel vorgelegt und im hinblick auf die eingesetzten jagdmethoden verglichen. eine region repräsentiert die gut erhaltenen mediterranen wälder südwest-spaniens. die andere, im süden portugals gelegene untersuchungsregion ist ein agrargebiet mit eingestreuten wäldern. unsere ergebnisse weisen auf einen höheren jagddruck sowie eine grö\ere populationsdichte der wildschweine im portugiesischen untersuchungsgebiet hin. der grö\ere jagddruck kann ursache für ein im mittel geringeres alter der dortigen wildschwein-population sein. es wurden ferner beachtliche unterschiede in den bejagungsmethoden zwischen den beiden untersuchungsgebieten und dem nordosten iberiens beobachtet. wegen dieser unterschiede erscheint ein direkter vergleich von streckenergebnissen aus verschiedenen regionen der iberischen halbinsel nicht ratsam.résuméau cours des dernières décennies, la distribution mondiale du sanglier (sus scrofa) a fortement augmenté, la péninsule ibérique ne faisant pas exception à cet égard. le sanglier colonise pratiquement l'entièreté du territoire ibérique où il représente aujourd'hui une des espèces-gibier les plus importantes. dans cette contribution, pour la première fois, l'analyse des tableaux de tir réalisés dans deux régions écologiquement différentes est présentée et rapportée aux techniques cynégétiques utilisées. l'une correspond aux forêts méditerranéennes bien conservées du sud-ouest de l'espagne, l'autre, située au sud du portugal, est constituée d'une alternance de terres agricoles et de forêts. nos résultats indiquent une pression cynégétique plus intense de même qu'une densité de population en sangliers plus élevée dans la partie portugaise de l'aire d'étude. la pression cynégétique plus forte peut donner lieu à une population de sangliers plus jeune. nous avons également constaté des différences considérables entre les techniques de tir utilisées dans les deux régions et celles utilisées dans le nord-est de la péninsule. il ne semble dès lors pas recommandable de comparer directement les statistiques de tir de différentes régions de la péninsule ibérique.
statistical modelling of gaze behaviour as categorical time series: what you should watch to save soccer penalties it is still not known what underlies successful performance in goaltending. some studies have reported that advanced cues from the shooter's body (hip, kicking leg or support leg) are most important (savelsbergh, g. j. p., williams, a. m., van der kamp, j., & ward, p. (2002). visual search, anticipation and expertise in soccer goalkeepers. journal of sports sciences, 20, 279-287; savelsbergh, g. j. p., williams, a. m., van der kamp, j., & ward, p. (2005). anticipation and visual search behaviour in expert soccer goalkeepers. ergonomics, 48, 1686-1697; williams, a. m., & burwitz, l. (1993). advanced cue utilization in soccer. in t. reilly, j. clarys, & a. stibbe (eds.), science and football ii (pp. 239-243). london, england: e&fn spon), while others have found that the early tracking of the object prior to and during flight is most critical (bard, c., & fleury, m. (1981). considering eye movement as a predictor of attainment. in: i. m. cockerill, & w. m. macgillvary (eds.), vision and sport (pp. 28-41). cheltenham, england: stanley thornes (publishers) ltd.). these results are similar to those found in a number of interceptive timing studies (land, m. f., & mcleod, p. (2000). from eye movements to actions: how batsmen hit the ball. nature neuroscience, 3, 1340-1345; ripoll and fleurance, 1988; vickers, j. n., & adolphe, r. m. (1997). gaze behaviour during a ball tracking and aiming skill. international journal of sports vision, 4, 18-27). the coupled gaze and motor behavior of elite goaltenders were determined while responding to wrist shots taken from 5 m and 10 m on ice. the results showed that the goalies faced shots that were significantly different in phase durations due to distance (5 versus 10 m), but this was not a factor in making saves. instead, the ability to stop the puck was dependent on the location, onset and duration of the final fixation/tracking gaze (or quiet eye) prior to initiating the saving action. the relative onset of quiet eye was significantly (p<.001) earlier (8.6%) and the duration was longer on saves (m=80.5%; 952.3 ms) compared to goals (onset 18.86%; m=70.1%, 826.1 ms). the quiet eye was located on the puck/stick during the preparation and execution of the shot in 70.53% of all trials, or on the ice in front of the release point of the puck (25.68%) and rarely on the body of the shooter (2.1%). the results are discussed within the context of current research on goaltending with specific emphasis on the timing of critical cues and the effect of tasks constraints.
peak exercise oxygen uptake and left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and arterial mechanics in healthy young men objectives the study was done to evaluate reliability of echocardiographic left ventricular (lv) mass.   background echocardiographic estimation of lv mass is affected by several sources of variability.   methods we assessed intrapatient reliability of lv mass measurements in 183 hypertensive patients (68% men, 65 +/- 9 years) enrolled in the prospective randomized enalapril study evaluating regression of ventricular enlargement (preserve) trial after a screening echocardiogram (echo) showed lv hypertrophy. a second echo was repeated at randomization (45 +/- 25 days later). two-dimensional (2d)-guided m-mode or 2d linear measurements of lv cavity and wall dimensions were verified by one experienced reader.   results mean lv mass was similar at first and second echo (243 +/- 53 vs. 241 +/- 54 g) and showed high reliability as estimated by intraclass correlation coefficient (rho) = 0.93. within-patient 5th, 10th, 90th and 95th percentiles of between-study difference in lv mass were -32 g, -28 g, +25 g and +35 g. mean lv mass fell less from the first to the second echo than expected from a formula to predict regression to the mean (2 +/- 19 vs. 17 +/- 12 g, p < 0.001). reliability was also high for lv internal diameter (rho = 0.87), septal (rho = 0.85) and posterior wall thickness (rho = 0.83). substantial or moderate reliability was observed for measures of lv systolic function and diastolic filling (rho from 0.71 to 0.57).   conclusions left ventricular mass had high reliability and little regression to the mean; between-study lv mass change of +/-35 g or +/-17 g had > or = 95% or > or = 80% likelihood of being true change.
physics of the nucleon sea quark distributions r � the quark and gluon distributions of the photon are determined in leading and higher order by imposing a vector-meson dominance (vmd) valencelike structure at a low resolution scale adopted from the pion. this leaves only one free parameter, not sufficiently constrained by vmd, to be fixed by experiment. our predictions are in agreement with presently available data for {ital f}{sub 2}{sup {gamma}}({ital x},{ital q}{sup 2}). simple parametri- zations of the resulting parton distributions are presented in the range 10{sup {minus}5}{approx lt}{ital x}{lt}1, 0.3{approx lt}{ital q}{sup 2}{approx lt}10{sup 6} gev{sup 2} as obtained from the leading- and higher-order evolution equations.
patients with spinal deformity over the age of 75: a retrospective analysis of operative versus non-operative management purpose of the study parameters determining sagittal balance are essential for optimal analysis and treatment of many spinal disorders. the purpose of this work was to validate a software designed to measure the principal parameters involved in sagittal balance of the spine.   material and methods six parameters (lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, sagittal tilt at t9, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, slope of the sacrum) were measured on lateral views of the spine from 100 healthy volunteers free of any spinal disease. two measurement techniques were used: manual measurement and automatic computerized measurement with this software. we hypothesized that manual measures could be accepted as reference values because they are currently the most widely used and because the computerized measurements were obtained using digitalized images that may have modified interpretation. the software was therefore validated by comparing the angles measured manually with the computer output. inter- and intraobserver coefficients of variation were calculated for the two measurement techniques. one operator performed both series of measurements (manual and computerized). two other operators preformed two series of independent measures using one of the measurement techniques. finally, two new operators performed a complete series of measurements using both measurement techniques. comparisons were performed with the t test for paired variables with calculation of the coefficients of correlation. intraclass coefficients of correlation were determined for inter- and intra-observer variability.   results there was an excellent correlation between the manual measurements and the computerized measurements with intra-class coefficients of correlation varying from 0.82 to 0.96. inter- and intra-observer variabilities were comparable for the two measurement techniques used to determine thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, and slope of the sacrum. inter- and intra-observer variability was lower when the sagittal tilt was measured with the software specially designed.   conclusion this comparison between two techniques for measuring pelvic and spinal parameters of sagittal balance of the spine demonstrated a good correlation between manual and the computerized measurements obtained with the software to be evaluated. computer-assisted measurements not only provided a saving in time but also minimized inter- and intra-observer variability for the estimation of certain parameters.
the use of colour in reference production: a comparison between dutch and greek we examine the problem of generating definite noun phrases that are appropriate referring expressions; that is, noun phrases that (a) successfully identify the intended referent to the hearer whilst (b) not conveying to him or her any false conversational implicatures (grice, 1975). we review several possible computational interpretations of the conversational implicature maxims, with different computational costs, and argue that the simplest may be the best, because it seems to be closest to what human speakers do. we describe our recommended algorithm in detail, along with a specification of the resources a host system must provide in order to make use of the algorithm, and an implementation used in the natural language generation component of the idas system.
integrative analysis with chip-seq advances the limits of transcript quantification from rna-seq. histones are frequently decorated with covalent modifications. these histone modifications are thought to be involved in various chromatin-dependent processes including transcription. to elucidate the relationship between histone modifications and transcription, we derived quantitative models to predict the expression level of genes from histone modification levels. we found that histone modification levels and gene expression are very well correlated. moreover, we show that only a small number of histone modifications are necessary to accurately predict gene expression. we show that different sets of histone modifications are necessary to predict gene expression driven by high cpg content promoters (hcps) or low cpg content promoters (lcps). quantitative models involving h3k4me3 and h3k79me1 are the most predictive of the expression levels in lcps, whereas hcps require h3k27ac and h4k20me1. finally, we show that the connections between histone modifications and gene expression seem to be general, as we were able to predict gene expression levels of one cell type using a model trained on another one.
in silico, experimental, mechanistic model for extended-release felodipine disposition exhibiting complex absorption and a highly variable food interaction absorption models used in the estimation of pharmacokinetic drug characteristics from plasma concentration data are generally empirical and simple, utilizing no prior information on gastro-intestinal (gi) transit patterns. our aim was to develop and evaluate an estimation strategy based on a mechanism-based model for drug absorption, which takes into account the tablet movement through the gi transit. this work is an extension of a previous model utilizing tablet movement characteristics derived from magnetic marker monitoring (mmm) and pharmacokinetic data. the new approach, which replaces mmm data with a gi transit model, was evaluated in data sets where mmm data were available (felodipine) or not available (diclofenac). pharmacokinetic profiles in both datasets were well described by the model according to goodness-of-fit plots. visual predictive checks showed the model to give superior simulation properties compared with a standard empirical approach (first-order absorption rate + lag-time). this model represents a step towards an integrated mechanism-based nlme model, where the use of physiological knowledge and in vitro–in vivo correlation helps fully characterize pk and generate hypotheses for new formulations or specific populations.
biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass. abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
characteristics of the bovicin hj 50 gene cluster in streptococcus bovis hj 50 three thermosensitive (ts) suicide vectors, pset4s, pset5s, and pset6s, have been constructed for gene replacement in streptococcus suis. each vector contains an antibiotic-resistance gene (spc or cat), a ts replication origin of pwv01 lineage, multiple cloning sites, lacz', and the cole1 replication origin of puc19. these vectors could be propagated at 37 degrees c in escherichia coli, but their replication was blocked above 37 degrees c in s. suis. moreover, the thermosensitivity of the replication origin was confirmed in s. equi ssp. equi, s. equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and s. dysgalactiae by using pset4s. for inactivation of the sly gene, which encodes a thiol-activated hemolysin of s. suis, pslyk, in which the sly gene was interrupted by the cat gene, was constructed using pset4s and introduced into s. suis dat2. after growth at the nonpermissive temperature under the antibiotic pressure, the chromosomal sly gene was replaced with the sly::cat gene of pslyk by a double-crossover event at a rate of 2.6% among chloramphenicol-resistant cells. moreover, complementation of the sly gene by use of the previously reported s. suis-e. coli shuttle vector pset2 was demonstrated. these results indicate that the ts suicide vectors described here will facilitate the genetic analysis of s. suis and other streptococci of veterinary importance by means of allelic exchange of the genes of interest via homologous recombination.
nutrient intake and nutritional status of newly diagnosed patients with cancer from the east coast of peninsular malaysia arm muscle area (ama, cm2) is currently calculated from triceps skinfold thickness (tsf, cm), and midarm circumference (mac, cm). in assessing the accuracy of the current equation by comparison to ama measured by computerized axial tomography, error in each of the four approximations made was found to result in a 20 to 25% overestimate of ama. two correctible error sources were: a 10 to 15% overestimation caused by assuming a circular midarm muscle compartment and a 5 to 10% overestimation due to inclusion of midarm cross-sectional bone area. corrected ama equations for men and women were respectively: [(mac - pi x tsf)2/4 pi] - 10, and [mac - pi x tsf)2/4 pip] - 6.5. with two additional study groups, the overall improved accuracy of the new equations was confirmed, although the average error for a given patient was 7 to 8%; the relationship between corrected ama and total body muscle mass was established [muscle mass (kg) = (ht, cm2) (0.0264 + 0.0029 x corrected ama)]; and the minimal range of corrected ama values compatible with survival (9 to 11 cm2) was defined. bedside estimates of undernutrition severity and prognosis can therefore be calculated from two simple measurements, tsf and mac.
dietary red meat aggravates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice whereas resistant starch attenuates inflammation background: we have previously demonstrated that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (dp) activity partially attenuates dextran sulfate sodium (dss) colitis in mice. the aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanisms of this protection. materials and methods: wildtype (wt) and dpiv−/− mice consumed 2% dss in drinking water for 6 days to induce colitis. mice were treated with saline or the dp inhibitors ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa or ile‐thia. dp mrna and enzyme levels were measured in the colon. glucagon‐like peptide (glp)‐2 and glp‐1 concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay, regulatory t‐cells (tregs) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (facs) on foxp3+t cells in blood, and neutrophil infiltration assessed by myeloperoxidase (mpo) assay. results: dp8 and dp2 mrna levels were increased (p < 0.05) in wt+saline mice compared to untreated wt mice with colitis. cytoplasmic dp enzyme activity was increased (p < 0.05) in dpiv−/− mice at day 6 of dss, while dp2 activity was increased (p < 0.05) in wt mice with colitis. glp‐1 (63%) and glp‐2 (50%) concentrations increased in wt+ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa mice compared to day‐0 controls. mpo activity was lower in wt+ile‐thia and wt+ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa treated mice compared to wt+saline (p < 0.001) at day 6 colitis. conclusions: dp expression and activity are differentially regulated during dss colitis, suggesting a pathophysiological role for these enzymes in human inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). dp inhibitors impaired neutrophil recruitment and maintenance of the treg population during dss‐colitis, providing further preclinical evidence for the potential therapeutic use of these inhibitors in ibd. finally, dpiv appears to play a critical role in mediating the protective effect of dp inhibitors. inflamm bowel dis 2010
double auction-inspired meta-scheduling of parallel applications on global grids many research and engineering fields, like bioinformatics or particle physics, are confident about the development of grid technologies to provide the huge amounts of computational and storage resources they require. although several projects are working on creating a reliable infrastructure consisting of persistent resources and services, the truth is that the grid will be a more and more dynamic entity as it grows. in this paper, we present a new tool that hides the complexity and dynamicity of the grid from developers and users, allowing the resolution of large computational experiments in a grid environment by adapting the scheduling and execution of jobs to the changing grid conditions and application dynamic demands.
muscle na+-k+-atpase response during 16 h of heavy intermittent cycle exercise. the purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that a single, extended session of heavy exercise would be effective in inducing adaptations in energy metabolism during exercise in the absence of increases in oxidative potential. ten healthy males [maximal aerobic power (vo(2 peak)) = 43.4 +/- 2.2 (se) ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)] participated in a 16-h training session involving cycling for 6 min each hour at approximately 90% of maximal oxygen consumption. measurements of metabolic changes were made on tissue extracted from the vastus lateralis during a two-stage standardized submaximal cycle protocol before (pre) and 36-48 h after (post) the training session. at pre, creatine phosphate (pcr) declined (p < 0.05) by 32% from 0 to 3 min and then remained stable until 20 min of exercise at 60% vo(2 peak) before declining (p < 0.05) by a further 35% during 20 min of exercise at 75% vo(2 peak). muscle lactate (mmol/kg dry wt) progressively increased (p < 0.05) from 4.59 +/- 0.64 at 0 min to 17.8 +/- 2.7 and 30.9 +/- 5.3 at 3 and 40 min, respectively, whereas muscle glycogen (mmol glucosyl units/kg dry wt) declined (p < 0.05) from a rest value of 360 +/- 24 to 276 +/- 31 and 178 +/- 36 at similar time points. during exercise after the training session, pcr and glycogen were not as depressed (p < 0.05), and increases in muscle lactate were blunted (p < 0.05). all of these changes occurred in the absence of increases in oxidative potential as measured by the maximal activities of citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase. these findings are consistent with other studies, namely, that muscle metabolic adaptations to regular exercise are an early adaptive event that occurs before increases in oxidative potential.
protecting personalized privacy against sensitivity homogeneity attacks over road networks in mobile services in this paper we discuss a new type of query in spatial databas es, called the trip planning query (tpq). given a set of points of interestp in space, where each point belongs to a specific category, a star ting points and a destinatione, tpq retrieves thebesttrip that starts at s, passes through at least one point from each category, and ends at e. for example, a driver traveling from boston to providence might want to stop to a gas station, a ban k and a post office on his way, and the goal is to provide him with the best possibl e route (in terms of distance, traffic, road conditions, etc.). the difficulty of this query lies in the existence of multiple choices per category. in this paper, w study fast approximation algorithms for tpq in a metric space. we provide a numb er of approximation algorithms with approximation ratios that depend o either the number of categories, the maximum number of points per category or b oth. therefore, for different instances of the problem, we can choose the alg orithm with the best approximation ratio, since they all run in polynomial time. furthermore, we use some of the proposed algorithms to derive efficient heuristi cs for large datasets stored in external memory. finally, we give an experimental ev luation of the proposed algorithms using both synthetic and real datasets .
the amount and integrity of mtdna in maize decline with development in maize (zea mays l.), chloroplast development progresses from the basal meristem to the mature leaf tip, and light is required for maturation to photosynthetic competence. during chloroplast greening, it was found that chloroplast dna (cpdna) is extensively degraded, falling to undetectable levels in many individual chloroplasts for three maize cultivars, as well as zea mexicana (the ancestor of cultivated maize) and the perennial species zea diploperennis. in dark-grown maize seedlings, the proplastid-to-etioplast transition is characterized by plastid enlargement, cpdna replication, and the retention of high levels of cpdna. when dark-grown seedlings are transferred to white light, the dna content per plastid increases slightly during the first 4 h of illumination and then declines rapidly to a minimum at 24 h during the etioplast-to-chloroplast transition. plastid autofluorescence (from chlorophyll) continues to increase as cpdna declines, whereas plastid size remains constant. it is concluded that the increase in cpdna that accompanies plastid enlargement is a consequence of cell and leaf growth, rather than illumination, whereas light stimulates photosynthetic capacity and cpdna instability. when cpdna from total tissue was monitored by blot hybridization and real-time quantitative pcr, no decline following transfer from dark to light was observed. the lack of agreement between dna per plastid and cpdna per cell may be attributed to nupts (nuclear sequences of plastid origin).
pilot implementation of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy in a university health setting objective while considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.   measurements the patient health questionnaire (phq) is a self-administered version of the prime-md diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. the phq-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 dsm-iv criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). the phq-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. construct validity was assessed using the 20-item short-form general health survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (mhp) interview in a sample of 580 patients.   results as phq-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 sf-20 subscales. also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. using the mhp reinterview as the criterion standard, a phq-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. phq-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.   conclusion in addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the phq-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. these characteristics plus its brevity make the phq-9 a useful clinical and research tool.
α2-adrenoreceptor constraint of catecholamine release and blood pressure is enhanced in female spontaneously hypertensive rats α2-adrenoceptors (ar) lower central sympathetic output and peripheral catecholamine release, thereby protecting against sympathetic hyperactivity and hypertension. norepinephrine re-uptake–transporter effectively (net) removes norepinephrine from the synapse. overflow to plasma will therefore not reflect release. here we tested if inhibition of re-uptake allowed presynaptic α2ar release control to be reflected as differences in norepinephrine overflow in anesthetized hypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) and normotensive rats (wky). we also tested if α2ar modulated the experiment-induced epinephrine secretion, and a phenylephrine-induced, α1-adrenergic vasoconstriction. blood pressure was recorded through a femoral artery catheter, and cardiac output by ascending aorta flow. after pre-treatment with net inhibitor (desipramine), and/or α2ar antagonist (yohimbine, l-659,066) or agonist (clonidine, st-91), we injected phenylephrine. arterial blood was sampled 15 min later. plasma catecholamine concentrations were not influenced by phenylephrine, and therefore reflected effects of pre-treatment. desipramine and α2ar antagonist separately had little effect on norepinephrine overflow. combined, they increased norepinephrine overflow, particularly in shr. clonidine, but not st-91, reduced, and pertussis toxin increased norepinephrine overflow in shr and epinephrine secretion in both strains. l-659,066 + clonidine (central α2ar-stimulation) normalized the high blood pressure, heart rate, and vascular tension in shr. α2ar antagonists reduced phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction equally in wky and shr. conclusions: α2aar inhibition increased norepinephrine overflow only when re-uptake was blocked, and then with particular efficacy in shr, possibly due to their high sympathetic tone. α2aar inhibited epinephrine secretion, particularly in shr. α2aar supported α1ar-induced vasoconstriction equally in the two strains. α2ar malfunctions were therefore not detected in shr under this basal condition.
muscle cocontraction following dynamics learning cocontraction (the simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles around a joint) provides the nervous system with a way to adapt the mechanical properties of the limb to changing task requirements-both in statics and during movement. however, relatively little is known about the conditions under which the motor system modulates limb impedance through cocontraction. the goal of this study was to test for a possible relationship between cocontraction and movement accuracy in multi-joint limb movements. the electromyographic activity of seven single- and double-joint shoulder and elbow muscles was recorded using surface electrodes while subjects performed a pointing task in a horizontal plane to targets that varied randomly in size. movement speed was controlled by providing subjects with feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. measures of cocontraction were estimated both during movement and during a 200-ms window immediately following movement end. we observed an inverse relationship between target size and cocontraction: as target size was reduced, cocontraction activity increased. in addition, trajectory variability decreased and endpoint accuracy improved. this suggests that, although energetically expensive, cocontraction may be a strategy used by the motor system to facilitate multi-joint arm movement accuracy. we also observed a general trend for cocontraction levels to decrease over time, supporting the idea that cocontraction and associated limb stiffness are reduced over the course of practice.
silencing, positive selection and parallel evolution: busy history of primate cytochromes c rates of molecular evolution vary over time and, hence, among lineages. in contrast, widely used methods for estimating divergence times from molecular sequence data assume constancy of rates. therefore, methods for estimation of divergence times that incorporate rate variation are attractive. improvements on a previously proposed bayesian technique for divergence time estimation are described. new parameterization more effectively captures the phylogenetic structure of rate evolution on a tree. fossil information and other evidence can now be included in bayesian analyses in the form of constraints on divergence times. simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of divergence time estimation is substantially enhanced when constraints are included.
biomechanical analysis of defensive cutting actions during game situations: six cases in collegiate soccer competitions in many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. however, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. the aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. a laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. this provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. the test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 hz motion analysis system. root mean square (rms) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. rms velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the rms differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. in conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. the kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. this method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.
intensity-dependent effect of body tilt angle on calf muscle fatigue in humans to explore the effect of posture on muscle performance, we tested the effects of body tilt angle on the strength, endurance, and fatigue of, and blood flow into, the plantar flexors. human subjects were fixed to a tilt table that could tilt them from the horizontal (0 degrees ) to upright (90 degrees ) position and enabled force to be applied to a footplate through isometric action of the right calf muscle. in experiment 1, six subjects performed a strength test and graded test (intermittent contractions) to the point of failure at three tilt angles (0, 47, and 90 degrees ). in experiment 2, seven subjects performed a strength test and constant-force test [70% maximum force (f(max)); intermittent contractions] to the point of failure in the horizontal and three inclined positions (32, 47, and 67 degrees ). in experiment 3, leg blood flow was assessed during constant-force exercise at two intensities (30 and 70% f(max)) and two tilt angles (0 and 67 degrees ) in six subjects. strength was not affected (p > 0.05) by tilt angle. time to failure during the graded test was significantly higher at 47 degrees (25.9 +/- 2.0 min) and 90 degrees (25.1 +/- 3.0 min) than 0 degrees (22.2 +/- 2.6 min). time to failure during the constant-force test was also significantly higher at 32 degrees (7.1 +/- 3.6 min), 47 degrees (8.0 +/- 5.2 min), and 67 degrees (8.6 +/- 5.6 min) compared with 0 degrees (4.0 +/- 2.6 min). when graded or constant-force exercise was performed with arterial flow to the leg eliminated, there were no differences in exercise time between the horizontal and an inclined position. during nonischemic exercise, leg blood flow was significantly higher during exercise in the inclined position. these results demonstrate that head-up tilt improves endurance of the plantar flexors, that this effect occurs in the absence of an effect on strength, and that it depends on an intact peripheral circulation. moreover, the postural effect on muscle endurance appears to be due to a greater blood flow into the leg, an effect that is established during the initial contractions.
activity group localization by modeling the relations among participants in this paper we present a framework for the recognition of collective human activities. a collective activity is defined or reinforced by the existence of coherent behavior of individuals in time and space. we call such coherent behavior ‘crowd context’. examples of collective activities are “queuing in a line” or “talking”. following [7], we propose to recognize collective activities using the crowd context and introduce a new scheme for learning it automatically. our scheme is constructed upon a random forest structure which randomly samples variable volume spatio-temporal regions to pick the most discriminating attributes for classification. unlike previous approaches, our algorithm automatically finds the optimal configuration of spatio-temporal bins, over which to sample the evidence, by randomization. this enables a methodology for modeling crowd context. we employ a 3d markov random field to regularize the classification and localize collective activities in the scene. we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the proposed framework in a number of experiments and show that our method outperforms state-of-the art action classification techniques [7, 19].
stable, congestion-controlled application-layer multicasting in pedestrian ad-hoc networks we describe a new scalable application-layer multicast protocol, specifically designed for low-bandwidth, data streaming applications with large receiver sets. our scheme is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the application-layer multicast peers and can support a number of different data delivery trees with desirable properties.we present extensive simulations of both our protocol and the narada application-layer multicast protocol over internet-like topologies. our results show that for groups of size 32 or more, our protocol has lower link stress (by about 25%), improved or similar end-to-end latencies and similar failure recovery properties. more importantly, it is able to achieve these results by using orders of magnitude lower control traffic.finally, we present results from our wide-area testbed in which we experimented with 32-100 member groups distributed over 8 different sites. in our experiments, average group members established and maintained low-latency paths and incurred a maximum packet loss rate of less than 1% as members randomly joined and left the multicast group. the average control overhead during our experiments was less than 1 kbps for groups of size 100.
dependency-based long short term memory network for drug-drug interaction extraction syntactic features play an essential role in identifying relationship in a sentence. previous neural network models directly work on raw word sequences or constituent parse trees, thus often suffer from irrelevant information introduced when subjects and objects are in a long distance. in this paper, we propose to learn more robust relation representations from shortest dependency paths through a convolution neural network. we further take the relation directionality into account and propose a straightforward negative sampling strategy to improve the assignment of subjects and objects. experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart approaches on the semeval-2010 task 8 dataset.
a memory-efficient bit-split parallel string matching using pattern dividing for intrusion detection systems due to the advantages of easy re-configurability and scalability, the memory-based string matching architecture is widely adopted by network intrusion detection systems (nids). in order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful nids system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. in this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement. for total snort string patterns, the new algorithm achieves 29% of memory reduction compared with the traditional aho-corasick algorithm [5]. moreover, since our approach is orthogonal to other memory reduction approaches, we can obtain substantial gain even after applying the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. for example, after applying the bit-split algorithm [9], we can still gain an additional 22% of memory reduction.
a coupled deformable model for tracking myocardial borders from real-time echocardiography using an incompressibility constraint this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
computational linguistics harnessing the statistical power of neural networks to perform language understanding and symbolic reasoning is difficult, when it requires executing efficient discrete operations against a large knowledge-base. in this work, we introduce a neural symbolic machine, which contains (a) a neural “programmer”, i.e., a sequence-to-sequence model that maps language utterances to programs and utilizes a key-variable memory to handle compositionality (b) a symbolic “computer”, i.e., a lisp interpreter that performs program execution, and helps find good programs by pruning the search space. we apply reinforce to directly optimize the task reward of this structured prediction problem. to train with weak supervision and improve the stability of reinforce, we augment it with an iterative maximum-likelihood training process. nsm outperforms the state-of-the-art on the webquestionssp dataset when trained from question-answer pairs only, without requiring any feature engineering or domain-specific knowledge.
a mathematical model of neonatal rat atrial monolayers with constitutively active acetylcholine-mediated k+ current 1. voltage clamp studies of the excitatory sodium current, ina, were carried out in rabbit cardiac purkinje fibres using th two‐micro‐electrode technique. previous work has shown the rabbit purkinje fibre to have relatively simple morphology (sommer & johnson, 1968) and electrical structure (colatsky & tsien, 1979a) compared to other cardiac preparations. 2. non‐uniformities in membrane potential were kept small by reducing the size of ina to less than 50 microa/cm2 of total membrane surface area through prepulse inactivation or removal of external sodium, nao. temporal resolution was improved by cooling to 10‐26 degrees c. these adjustments did not greatly alter the measured properties of the sodium channel. 3. under these conditions, sodium currents were recorded satisfying a number of criteria for adequate voltage control. direct measurement of longitudinal non‐uniformity using a second voltage electrode showed only small deviations at the time of peak current. 4. the properties of the sodium channel were examined using conventional protocols. both peak sodium permeability, pna, and steady‐state sodium inactivation, h infinity, showed a sigmoidal dependence on membrane potential. pna rose steeply with small depolarizations, increasing roughly e‐fold per 3.2 mv, and reaching half‐maximal activation at ‐30 +/‐ 2 mv. the h infinity ‐v curve had a midpoint of ‐74.9 +/‐ 2 mv and a reciprocal slope of 4.56 +/‐ 0.13 mv at temperatures of 10‐19.5 degrees c, and showed a dependence on temperature, shifting to more negative potentials with cooling (approximately 3 mv/10 degrees c). recovery of ina from inactivation in double pulse experiments followed a single exponential time course with time constants of 108‐200 msec at 19 degrees c for holding potentials near ‐80 mv. no attempt was made to describe the activation kinetics because of uncertainties about the early time course of the current. 5. these data predict a maximum duration for ina of less than 1‐2 msec and a maximum peak current density of about 500 microa/cm2 under physiological conditions, i.e. 37 degrees c and 150 mm‐nao. this current magnitude is sufficient to discharge the membrane capacitance at rates comparable to those measured experimentally (311 +/‐ 27 v/sec, colatsky & tsien, 1979a). 6. the limitations of the method are discussed. the major problem is the longitudinal cable delay which limits the speed of voltage control. this makes it difficult to separate the activation of ina from the decay of the capacity transient for potentials positive to ‐15 mv. 7. it is concluded that the approach described is valid for measurements of sodium currents in the potential range where action potentials are initiated, making it possible to study cardiac sodium channels in an adult mammalian preparation which is free of enzymatic treatment.

callous-unemotional traits and antisocial behavior among adolescents: the role of self-serving cognitions this study investigates the relationship between the self-report youth psychopathic traits inventory (ypi) and the clinician-rated psychopathy checklist: youth version (pcl:yv). a representative sample of 92 girls and 70 boys, 12 to 20 years of age (mean age, 17 years), who received services at a clinic for adolescents with substance misuse problems, was studied. moderate correlations (r =.30—.51) were found between conceptually corresponding ypi and pcl:yv factor scores among both boys and girls, whereas correlations between individual subscales of the ypi and items of the pcl:yv were not as consistent. a cross-tabulation of groupings based on the three-factor models of the two instruments largely supported the categorical convergent validity of the ypi, particularly for low and high scorers. although more studies with larger samples are needed, results indicate that the ypi is a cost-effective measure of psychopathic traits in adolescents in research settings.
recurrent plot analysis of leakage current on flashover performance of rime-iced composite insulator due to the widespread use of polymeric insulating materials in radiation environments, there is an increasing demand to evaluate the radiation effects on the surface dielectric characteristics of polymeric insulating materials. this paper presents a recurrence plot approach to analyze the surface discharge of gamma-ray irradiated polymeric insulating materials based on the tracking test described in iec60112. because the resulting comparative tracking index has wide variation, an attempt has been made to evaluate the resistance to tracking more consistently. in this research, for different dosages of gamma-ray irradiation, the discharge currents are detected when the discharge occurs on the sample surface. recurrence plots of the discharge currents are derived. it is found that the resistance to tracking could be projected on a map as a function of the dosage of irradiation. the recurrence plots are sensitive and give visual methods for identification of the dosage of irradiation effects on the resistance to tracking. results obtained show that with the increase of dosage of irradiation, the resistance to tracking of polybutylene terephthalate decreases, but increases for polyethylene terephthalate.
explicit conjunctions without compilation: computing hff(pic) in polynomial time heuristic functions based on the delete relaxation compute upper and lower bounds on the optimal delete-relaxation heuristic h+, and are of paramount importance in both optimal and satisficing planning. here we introduce a principled and flexible technique for improving h+, by augmenting delete-relaxed planning tasks with a limited amount of delete information. this is done by introducing special fluents that explicitly represent conjunctions of fluents in the original planning task, rendering h+ the perfect heuristic h* in the limit. previous work has introduced a method in which the growth of the task is potentially exponential in the number of conjunctions introduced. we formulate an alternative technique relying on conditional effects, limiting the growth of the task to be linear in this number. we show that this method still renders h+ the perfect heuristic h* in the limit. we propose techniques to find an informative set of conjunctions to be introduced in different settings, and analyze and extend existing methods for lower-bounding and upperbounding h+ in the presence of conditional effects. we evaluate the resulting heuristic functions empirically on a set of ipc benchmarks, and show that they are sometimes much more informative than standard delete-relaxation heuristics.
a social linkage view on the business value of it as interest into the nature and value of electronic data interchange (edi) within organizations continues to grow, it becomes increasingly desirable to establish a tactical linkage between the strategic value of edi and observed operational benefits. this article provides such a tactical linkage by presenting an approach to edi measurement consisting of four facets: volume, diversity, breadth, and depth of a firm's edi initiatives. each of these facets is defined and then described through its application within the contexts of seven case sites, where each case site represents a strategic business unit having a long, successful history of edi use. the article concludes with suggestions for both practice and research.
simple representation and approximate search of feature vectors for large-scale object recognition stable local feature detection and representation is a fundamental component of many image registration and object recognition algorithms. mikolajczyk and schmid (june 2003) recently evaluated a variety of approaches and identified the sift [d. g. lowe, 1999] algorithm as being the most resistant to common image deformations. this paper examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor used by sift. like sift, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the image gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead of using sift's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply principal components analysis (pca) to the normalized gradient patch. our experiments demonstrate that the pca-based local descriptors are more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more compact than the standard sift representation. we also present results showing that using these descriptors in an image retrieval application results in increased accuracy and faster matching.
adversarial personalized ranking for recommendation we present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. we describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. we give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. we experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
distributed dynamic pricing with alternating decision making of market players distributed optimal power flow (opf) is a challenging non-linear, non-convex problem of central importance to the future power grid. although many approaches are currently available in the literature, these require some form of central coordination to properly work. in this paper a fully distributed and robust algorithm for opf is proposed which does not require any form of central coordination. the algorithm is based upon the alternating direction multiplier method (admm) in a form recently proposed by the author, which, in turn, builds upon the work of schizas the approach is customized as a region-based optimization procedure, and it is tested in meaningful scenarios.
a comparative analysis of social sciences citation tools the web of science is no longer the only database which offers citation indexing of the social sciences. scopus, csa illumina and google scholar are new entrants in this market. the holdings and citation records of these four databases were assessed against two sets of data one drawn from the 2001 research assessment exercise and the other from the international bibliography of the social sciences. initially, csa illumina's coverage at journal title level appeared to be the most comprehensive. but when recall and average citation count was tested at article level and rankings extrapolated by submission frequency to individual journal titles, scopus was ranked first. when issues of functionality, the quality of record processing and depth of coverage are taken into account, scopus and web of science have a significant advantage over the other two databases. from this analysis, scopus offers the best coverage from amongst these databases and could be used as an alternative to the web of science as a tool to evaluate the research impact in the social sciences.
the effect of individual differences, tasks, and decision models on user acceptance of decision support systems this paper describes a microeconomic theory-based tool, called cost analysis, which can be used in mis research to develop guidance for systems analysts and information resource managers. an example of this guidance is a matrix of decision making contexts versus appropriate mis/dss support. systems analysts can use this matrix to help identify appropriate mis/dss design alternatives. information resource managers can use this matrix to help plan for the proper evolution of mis/dss support. introduction to reduce the average decision quality produced. this quality can be increased to its initial level via increased this paper describes an approach for determining what investment in mis (e.g., more sophisticated mis) and/or kind of management information systems (mis) or deciin management (e.g., spending for management training sion support systems (dss) are appropriate for various or hiring more competent managers). thus, the cost of decision making contexts. this approach, called cost producing decisions at the intitial guality level increases analysis, is useful in research developing guidance for as problem complexity increases. systems analysts choosing information support for decision makers, and in research developing guidance for alternative mis can be compared based upon the cost of information resource managers planning the mis* portproducing equal quality decison in an environment folio. one result of cost analysis is a matrix of decision described in terms of problem complexity. if the commaking contexts versus appropriate mis support. this plexity assocated with a specific context results in higher matrix can be used by systems analysts to identify viable decision production costs using one mis than that using design alternatives. the matrix can also be used by inforanother mis, then the second mis is preferred. this cost mation resource managers to identify and plan for approanalysis approach is described in greater detail below, priate changes in the firm's mis portfolio. and applied to determining appropriate mis support for contexts within the following descriptive frameworks: cost analysis maps appropriate mis support to various decision contexts based upon problem complexity, and • product life cycle the impact of complexity upon the cost of making decisions. it is hypothesized that the cost of making decisions • gorry-scott morton management planning and of a given quality increases as problem complexity control activities increases.** problem complexity is defined along four dimensions: the product life cycle framework provides a vehicle for understanding the application of cost analysis to mis • problem duration-the time allowed for problem portfolio planning. a profile of appropriate mis is develsolution oped, in accord with changing decision making contexts associated with the manufacture of products progressing • problem homogeneity-the lack of problem type through their life cycles. these changing decision convariety texts reflect changes in marketing and manufucturing strategies. the gorry-scott morton framework provides • problem predictability-the ability to forcast the an opportunity for understanding the application of cost occurrence of problems analysis to systems design. categories of appropriate mis are developed for specific management planning • problem knowledge-the understanding of the and control activities. these catagories can be used by problem; problem structure systems analysts to identify appropriate mis support of managerial activities. a decrease in any of these dimensions represents an increase in problem complexity. for example, a decrease using these two frameworks as examples also allows a in problem knowledge in a decision context is expected demonstration of support for the validity of cost analysis.
caprg: sequence assembling pipeline for next generation sequencing of non-model organisms we have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called "velvet," to manipulate de bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. a de bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. applying velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb n50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb n50 on simulated mammalian bacs. when applied to real solexa data sets without read pairs, velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian bac, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.
effects of blackcurrant anthocyanin intake on peripheral muscle circulation during typing work in humans abstract we have investigated the etiology of lower-back muscle fatigue using simultaneous recordings of electromyography (emg), mechanomyography (mmg), and near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) in an attempt to shed some light on the electrophysiological, mechanical, and metabolic characteristics, respectively. eight male subjects performed isometric back extensions at an angle of 15° with reference to the horizontal plane, for a period of 60 s. surface emg, mmg and nirs signals were recorded simultaneously from the center of the erector spinae at the level of l3. nirs was measured to determine the level of muscle blood volume (bv) and oxygenation (oxy-hb). the root mean square amplitude value (rms) of the emg signal was significantly increased at the initial phase of contraction and then fell significantly, while mean power frequency (mpf) of the emg signal decreased significantly and progressively as a function of time. there were also significant initial increases in rms-mmg that were followed by progressive decreases at the end of fatiguing contractions. mpf-mmg remained unchanged. muscle bv and oxy-hb decreased dramatically at the onset of the contraction and then remained almost constant throughout the rest of the contraction. these results, obtained by simultaneous recordings of emg, mmg, and nirs, demonstrate that the restriction of blood flow due to high intramuscular mechanical pressure is one of the most important factors in muscle fatigue in the lower-back muscles. in addition, the simultaneous recording system described here can be used to obtain more reliable information regarding the mechanism(s) of lower-back muscle fatigue.
updating target distance across eye movements in depth. an experiment investigated in human adults the sensorimotor transformation involved in pointing to a spatial target identified previously by kinesthetic cues. in the “locating phase,” a computer-controlled mechanical arm guided the left [condition lr (left–right)] or right [condition rr (right–right)] finger of the blindfolded participant to one of 27 target positions. in the subsequent “pointing phase,” the participant tried to reach the same position with the right finger. the final finger position and the posture of the arm were measured in both conditions. constant errors were large but consistent and remarkably similar across conditions, suggesting that, whatever the locating hand, target position is coded in an extrinsic frame of reference (target position hypothesis). the main difference between the same-hand (rr) and different-hand (lr) conditions was a symmetric shift of the pattern of endpoints with respect to the midsagittal plane. this effect was modeled accurately by assuming a systematic bias in the perception of the postural angles of the locating arm. the analysis of the variable errors indicated that target position is represented internally in a spherical coordinate system centered on the shoulder of the pointing arm and that the main source of variability is within the planning stage of the pointing movement. locating and pointing postures depended systematically on target position. we tested qualitatively the hypothesis that the selection of both postures (inverse kinematic problem) is constrained by a minimum-distance principle. in condition rr, pointing posture depended also on the locating posture, implying the presence of a memory trace of the previous movement. a scheme is suggested to accommodate the results within an extended version of the target position hypothesis.
clinical applications of marsala for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy. preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is well established method for treatment of genetic problems associated with infertility. moreover, pgd with next-generation sequencing (ngs) provide new possibilities for diagnosis and new parameters for evaluation in, for example, aneuploidy screening. the aim of the study was to report the successful pregnancy outcome following pgd with ngs as the method for 24 chromosome aneuploidy screening in the case of robertsonian translocation. day 3 embryos screening for chromosomal aneuploidy was performed in two consecutive in vitro fertilization (ivf) cycles, first with fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), and then with ngs-based protocol. in each ivf attempt, three embryos were biopsied. short duration of procedures enabled fresh embryo transfer without the need for vitrification. first ivf cycle with the embryo selected using pgd analysis with the fish method ended with pregnancy loss in week 8. the second attempt with ngs-based aneuploidy screening led to exclusion of the following two embryos: one embryo with 22 monosomy and one with multiple aneuploidies. the transfer of the only euploid blastocyst resulted in the successful pregnancy outcome. the identification of the euploid embryo based on the ngs application was the first successful clinical application of ngs-based pgd in the case of the robertsonian translocation carrier couple.
the influence of incline and speed on work rate, gross efficiency and kinematics of roller ski skating objective to examine the effect of an increase in roller ski rolling resistance on the physiological and upper body demands of roller skiing with the v2-alternate technique.   methods nine highly skilled cross-country skiers roller skied at three paced speeds on a flat oval loop using roller skis with high (hir) and low (lowr) rolling resistance. oxygen uptake (vo2), heart rate, and poling forces were measured during the last 30 s and rating of perceived exertion (rpe) was requested immediately after each 4-min bout of roller skiing.   results vo2 and all force-related variables increased significantly with speed and were higher (p < 0.01) for hir at given speeds. poling time was similar between hir and lowr, whereas poling recovery time was shorter (p = 0.0002) and cycle rate was higher (p = 0.002) for hir. for given vo2 levels, peak and average forces, heart rates, and rpe values were similar between hir and lowr, whereas average poling force across the cycle was greater (p = 0.006) and duty cycle (i.e., percentage of cycle when poling forces were applied) was higher (p = 0.0001) with hir.   conclusions 1) the decrease in poling recovery time and increase in cycle rate associated with an increase in roller ski rolling resistance is comparable to the effect previously observed from increasing grade and probably occurs as a means of limiting deceleration. 2) since changes in rolling resistance do not alter the relationships of rpe and heart rate with vo2, the central cardiovascular adaptations from roller ski training should not be affected by the rolling resistance of the roller skis. 3) higher resistance roller skis are likely to induce greater upper body aerobic adaptations than lower resistance roller skis.
actionness ranking with lattice conditional ordinal random fields detecting humans in films and videos is a challenging problem owing to the motion of the subjects, the camera and the background and to variations in pose, appearance, clothing, illumination and background clutter. we develop a detector for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds, testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. these motion-based descriptors are combined with our histogram of oriented gradient appearance descriptors. the resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. we validate our results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. the combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000 windows tested at 8% miss rate on our test set 1.
role of the skp1 prolyl-hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in oxygen dependent submerged development of dictyostelium o(2) regulates multicellular development of the social amoeba dictyostelium, suggesting it may serve as an important cue in its native soil environment. dictyostelium expresses an hifα-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p4h1) whose levels affect the o(2)-threshold for culmination implicating it as a direct o(2)-sensor, as in animals. but dictyostelium lacks hifα, a mediator of animal prolyl 4-hydroxylase signaling, and p4h1 can hydroxylate pro143 of skp1, a subunit of e3(scf)ubiquitin-ligases. skp1 hydroxyproline then becomes the target of five sequential glycosyltransferase reactions that modulate the o(2)-signal. here we show that genetically induced changes in skp1 levels also affect the o(2)-threshold, in opposite direction to that of the modification enzymes suggesting that the latter reduce skp1 activity. consistent with this, overexpressed skp1 is poorly hydroxylated and skp1 is the only p4h1 substrate detectable in extracts. effects of pro143 mutations, and of combinations of skp1 and enzyme level perturbations, are consistent with pathway modulation of skp1 activity. however, some effects were not mirrored by changes in modification of the bulk skp1 pool, implicating a skp1 subpopulation and possibly additional unknown factors. altered skp1 levels also affected other developmental transitions in a modification-dependent fashion. whereas hydroxylation of animal hifα results in its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, dictyostelium skp1 levels were little affected by its modification status. these data indicate that skp1 and possibly e3(scf)ubiquitin-ligase activity modulate o(2)-dependent culmination and other developmental processes, and at least partially mediate the action of the hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in o(2)-sensing.
skeletal facial balance and harmony in the cleft patient: principles and techniques in orthognathic surgery craniofacial osteotomies have by convention been bilamellar translocations of the entire substance of the dysmorphic bone. this approach limits the surgeon by reducing the stable bone mass available for fixation, creating dependence on concave surfaces. most important, it changes the bony topography that determines the preoperative plan. this paper presents a new craniofacial concept and technique used in 26 patients with various dysmorphic syndromes who were reconstructed by performing a lamellar split osteotomy. this technique maintains the internal lamella in its native position, thereby allowing it to act as a reference for the bony topography and providing a stable facial framework for rigid fixation. this interlamellar osteotomy has led to improved aesthetic results in the orthomorphic reconstructions of congenital and other deformities. it can be used in any aesthetic patient in whom contour changes or augmentation of form is desired. it is recommended as a preferred method for achieving quantitative contour improvement in patients over 3 years of age.
antigenic and genetic characterization of a divergent african virus, ikoma lyssavirus abstract all lyssaviruses cause fatal encephalitis in mammals. there is sufficient antigenic variation within the genus to cause variable vaccine efficacy, but this variation is difficult to characterize quantitatively: sequence analysis cannot yet provide detailed antigenic information, and antigenic neutralization data have been refractory to high-resolution robust interpretation. here, we address these issues by using state-of-the-art antigenic analyses to generate a high-resolution antigenic map of a global panel of 25 lyssaviruses. we compared the calculated antigenic distances with viral glycoprotein ectodomain sequence data. although 67% of antigenic variation was predictable from the glycoprotein amino acid sequence, there are in some cases substantial differences between genetic and antigenic distances, thus highlighting the risk of inferring antigenic relationships solely from sequence data at this time. these differences included epidemiologically important antigenic differences between vaccine strains and wild-type rabies viruses. further, we quantitatively assessed the antigenic relationships measured by using rabbit, mouse, and human sera, validating the use of nonhuman experimental animals as a model for determining antigenic variation in humans. the use of passive immune globulin is a crucial component of rabies postexposure prophylaxis, and here we also show that it is possible to predict the reactivity of immune globulin against divergent lyssaviruses.
activation of k+ channels induces apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. over recent years, it has become clear that mitochondria play a central role in many key aspects of animal physiology and pathophysiology. their central and ubiquitous task is clearly the production of atp. nevertheless, they also play subtle roles in glucose homeostasis, acting as the sensor for substrate supply in the transduction pathway that promotes insulin secretion by the pancreatic β‐cell and that modulates the excitability of the hypothalamic glucose‐sensitive neurons involved in appetite control. mitochondria may also act as sensors of availability of oxygen, the other major mitochondrial substrate, in the regulation of respiration. mitochondria take up calcium, and the high capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake pathway provides a mechanism that couples energy demand to increased atp production through the calcium‐dependent upregulation of mitochondrial enzyme activity. mitochondrial calcium accumulation may also have a substantial impact on the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular calcium signals, with subtle differences of detail in different cell types. recent work has also revealed the centrality of mitochondrial dysfunction as an irreversible step in the pathway to both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. this review looks at recent developments in these rapidly evolving areas of cell physiology in an attempt to draw together disparate areas of research into a common theme.
complementary populations of human adipose cd34+ progenitor cells promote growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis of breast cancer. previous studies have suggested a "catalytic role" in neoplastic angiogenesis and cancer progression for bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (epc). however, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the quantitative role of marrow-derived epcs in cancer vascularization is extremely variable. we have found that human and murine white adipose tissue (wat) is a very rich reservoir of cd45-cd34(+) epcs with endothelial differentiation potential, containing a mean of 263 times more cd45-cd34(+) cells/ml than bone marrow. compared with marrow-derived cd34(+) cells mobilized in blood by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, purified wat-cd34(+) cells expressed similar levels of stemness-related genes, significantly increased levels of angiogenesis-related genes, and increased levels of fap-α, a crucial suppressor of antitumor immunity. in vitro, wat-cd34(+) cells generated mature endothelial cells and capillary tubes as efficiently as mature mesenchymal cells. the coinjection of human wat-cd34(+) cells from lipotransfer procedures contributed to tumor vascularization and significantly increased tumor growth and metastases in several orthotopic models of human breast cancer in immunodeficient mice. endothelial cells derived from human wat-cd34(+) cells lined the lumen of cancer vessels. these data indicate that cd34(+) wat cells can promote cancer progression and metastases. our results highlight the importance of gaining a better understanding of the role of different wat-derived cells used in lipotransfer for breast reconstruction in patients with breast cancer.
functionalising opals: versatile self-assembled photonic crystal devices a capillary deposition method for the preparation of opal and inverse opal films has been developed. by this method, one can control the film thickness and the crack arrangement in opal as well as inverse opal structures. this method combines tube capillarity with cell capillarity or with gravity depending on the stability of the suspensions. the combination of tube capillarity with cell capillarity is used to prepare opal films from stable suspensions. the tube capillary transports the suspension, while the cell capillary helps to assemble the spheres. the setup defines the drying fronts, thickness, and crack arrangements of the opal films. the combination of capillarity with gravity is useful for making opal films from unstable suspensions. opal films of spheres with size up to 1 mum can be easily prepared from this combination. here, the gravity influences the arrangement of the spheres. the two-capillary setup has also been used to infiltrate the opal films with a titania precursor. after calcination, inverse titania opal films with skeleton structure have been obtained.
heterogeneous- and numa-aware scheduling for many-core architectures on august 24, 2006, the standard performance evaluation corporation (spec) announced cpu2006 [2], which replaces cpu2000. the spec cpu benchmarks are widely used in both industry and academia [3].
effect of diabetes mellitus on rat placenta cellularity. we describe a modified procedure of the diphenylamine-colorimetric method for assay of dna that is shorter than the procedure described by burton. this improvement is achieved by raising the sample incubation temperature to 50 degrees c. the higher temperature hastens and stabilizes the diphenylamine reaction with dna so that absorbances of samples can be measured as early as 3 h after the reaction is started. this shortened assay is able to detect as little as 3 micrograms of calf thymus dna. this method is suitable for measuring dna content of epidermal tissue.

representation learning for single-channel source separation and bandwidth extension we present a signal processing algorithm to convert speech signals with "standard telephone" quality into 7 khz wideband speech. a statistical approach based on a hidden markov model (hmm) is used, which takes into account several features of the band-limited speech. the narrowband input signal is classified into a limited number of speech sounds (hmm states) for which the wideband spectral envelope is estimated using the pre-trained model. the enhanced speech exhibits a significantly improved quality without objectionable artifacts.
herd behavior in the japanese loan market: evidence from bank panel data in a rational profit-maximizing world, banks should msdntain a credit policy of lending if and only if borrowers have positive net present value projects. why then are changes in credit policy seemingly correlated with changes in the condition of those demanding credit? this paper argues that rational bank managers with short horizons will set credit policies that influence and are influenced by other banks and demand side conditions. this leads to a theory of low frequency business cycles driven by bank credit policies. evidence from the banking crisis in new england in the early 1990s is consistent with the assumptions and predictions of the theory.
invasive alien plants affect grassland ant communities, colony size and foraging behaviour abstract.a method to estimate the number of workers in myrmica ant nests on abandoned meadows was developed based on removal of workers. ant workers have a tendency to climb up on wooden sticks put into their nests, therefore, assuming that the number of workers removed on sticks is related to the total number of workers within the nests, regression models for myrmica rubra, m. ruginodis and m. scabrinodis may be built. we used a general regression model to perform a backward stepwise elimination of explanatory variables. these were the number of workers removed on sticks, temperature at the nest and site (a categorical variable). in case of each species the final model contained only the number of workers removed as a significant variable. the method is apparently non-destructive as we did not observe decreased survival of nests surveyed as compared to control nests. the method can be a very useful tool in population studies of ants as well as in biodiversity projects, where ants are used as bioinidcators.
force coordination in static manipulation tasks: effects of the change in direction and handedness the purpose of the study was to evaluate a method for testing bimanual prehension based on a novel experimental device. the device consists of two handles allowing for simultaneous measurement of bimanual hand grip forces (gf) and different patterns of load forces (lf) exerted during compression and tension along the longitudinal axis. in order to assess the reliability of the obtained measures, eight healthy subjects were tested over three consecutive test, while three moderately impaired neurological patients were tested once. in healthy subjects, high coordination was observed between gfs and lfs, as well as between two gfs and two lfs. the results also suggest a satisfactory task performance in regards to exerting the instructed lf profile, as well as a sufficient, but not excessive gf. the reliability of most of the assessed variables proved to be either moderate or high. when compared to healthy subjects, the data obtained from neurological patients mainly revealed irregular patterns of lfs, excessive gfs, as well as a relatively weak relationship between gfs and lfs. it was concluded that the evaluated methodological approach can be applied not only to explore uni- and bi-manual coordination of arm and hand grip forces in various prehensile activities, but also to serve as a basis for future development of specific clinical tests for neurological patients and other populations that demonstrate impaired hand function.
the tip-link antigen, a protein associated with the transduction complex of sensory hair cells, is protocadherin-15 tip links are extracellular, cell-surface-associated filaments of unknown molecular composition that are thought to gate the mechanotransducer channel of the sensory hair cell. they disappear from the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation and lanthanum treatment and resist degradation by the protease subtilisin. a monoclonal antibody derived from a hybridoma screen identified a novel antigen associated with tip links, the tip-link antigen. the tip-link antigen is also associated with kinocilial links, subtilisin-resistant filaments that are sensitive to calcium chelation and connect the kinocilium to the tallest stereocilia of the hair bundle. furthermore, the tip-link antigen is expressed in the retina, where it is associated with the ciliary calyx, a ring of microvilli that surrounds the outer segment of the photoreceptor. the tip-link antigen rapidly disappears from the surface of the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation. it is also subtilisin resistant, relative to the ankle-link antigen, an antigen associated with another type of hair bundle link. the tip-link antigen is lanthanum sensitive and, like tip links, reappears on the surface of the hair bundle after calcium chelation. the monoclonal antibody to the tip-link antigen immunoprecipitates two concanavalin a-reactive polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 200 and 250 kda from detergent extracts of the retina. these results provide the first identification of a cell surface antigen associated with tip links, indicate that tip links share properties in common with kinocilial links, and reveal a second epitope that, along with the ankle-link antigen, is common to both sensory hair bundles and the ciliary calyx of photoreceptors.
stacked deconvolutional network for semantic segmentation we present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3d geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. by examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. we built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 ground-truth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. to further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data. our system produces an accurate prediction of geometric context of video achieving 96% accuracy across main geometric classes.
detecting variability in matlab/simulink models: an industry-inspired technique and its evaluation case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. however, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. this paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. the content is based on the authors’ own experience from conducting and reading case studies. the terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. we present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.
language adaptation experiments via cross-lingual embeddings for related languages the zero-shot paradigm exploits vector-based word representations extracted from text corpora with unsupervised methods to learn general mapping functions from other feature spaces onto word space, where the words associated to the nearest neighbours of the mapped vectors are used as their linguistic labels. we show that the neighbourhoods of the mapped elements are strongly polluted by hubs, vectors that tend to be near a high proportion of items, pushing their correct labels down the neighbour list. after illustrating the problem empirically, we propose a simple method to correct it by taking the proximity distribution of potential neighbours across many mapped vectors into account. we show that this correction leads to consistent improvements in realistic zero-shot experiments in the cross-lingual, image labeling and image retrieval domains.
an integrated weights particle filter algorithm based on correlation particle estimation and sequential importance re-sampling this article analyses the recently suggested particle approach to filtering time series. we suggest that the algorithm is not robust to outliers for two reasons: the design of the simulators and the use of the discrete support to represent the sequentially updating prior distribution. here we tackle the first of these problems.
evidence for peroxynitrite as a signaling molecule in flow-dependent activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
stepwise catalytic mechanism via short-lived intermediate inferred from combined qm/mm merp and pes calculations on retaining glycosyltransferase ppgalnact2 we present the theoretical and technical foundations of the amsterdam density functional (adf) program with a survey of the characteristics of the code (numerical integration, density fitting for the coulomb potential, and sto basis functions). recent developments enhance the efficiency of adf (e.g., parallelization, near order‐n scaling, qm/mm) and its functionality (e.g., nmr chemical shifts, cosmo solvent effects, zora relativistic method, excitation energies, frequency‐dependent (hyper)polarizabilities, atomic vdd charges). in the applications section we discuss the physical model of the electronic structure and the chemical bond, i.e., the kohn–sham molecular orbital (mo) theory, and illustrate the power of the kohn–sham mo model in conjunction with the adf‐typical fragment approach to quantitatively understand and predict chemical phenomena. we review the “activation‐strain ts interaction” (ats) model of chemical reactivity as a conceptual framework for understanding how activation barriers of various types of (competing) reaction mechanisms arise and how they may be controlled, for example, in organic chemistry or homogeneous catalysis. finally, we include a brief discussion of exemplary applications in the field of biochemistry (structure and bonding of dna) and of time‐dependent density functional theory (tddft) to indicate how this development further reinforces the adf tools for the analysis of chemical phenomena. © 2001 john wiley & sons, inc. j comput chem 22: 931–967, 2001
shift work and diabetes – a systematic review objective: this study investigated the effect of alternating shift work (asw) on the onset of diabetes mellitus in japanese workers compared with onset in day-shift work (dsw). methods: a longitudinal study was carried out on a dsw group (n = 3203) and asw group (n = 2426) of a steel company who received their annual health checkups over a 10-year period between 1991 and 2001. the association between job schedule type and onset of diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin a1c ≥6.0% or medication) was investigated by multivariate pooled logistic regression analyses. results: the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the development of diabetes mellitus in the asw group compared with the dsw group was 1.35 (1.05–1.75). conclusions: our study revealed that the asw is an independent risk factor for the onset of diabetes mellitus.
a critical analysis of child and adolescent mental health services policy in england ▪ abstract this paper provides a survey of critical discourse analysis (cda), a recent school of discourse analysis that concerns itself with relations of power and inequality in language. cda explicitly intends to incorporate social-theoretical insights into discourse analysis and advocates social commitment and interventionism in research. the main programmatic features and domains of enquiry of cda are discussed, with emphasis on attempts toward theory formation by one of cda's most prominent scholars, norman fairclough. another section reviews the genesis and disciplinary growth of cda, mentions some of the recent critical reactions to it, and situates it within the wider picture of a new critical paradigm developing in a number of language-oriented (sub) disciplines. in this critical paradigm, topics such as ideology, inequality, and power figure prominently, and many scholars productively attempt to incorporate social-theoretical insights into the study of language.
the role of information search in seeking alternative treatment for back pain: a qualitative analysis this research used the somewhat new methodology of convergent interviews to develop a conceptual framework about relationship constructs in an internet environment. more generally, this article describes and illustrates the processes and the strengths of convergent interviewing to investigate under‐researched areas, and compares it with alternative qualitative techniques like in‐depth interviews, case research and focus groups. the illustration involves interviews conducted with marketing managers and business consultants from ten service companies, about internet and relationship marketing. it is argued that convergent interviewing is more appropriate than some other qualitative methods to investigate under‐researched areas where there are few experts because it provides a way of quickly converging on key issues in the area, an efficient mechanism for data analysis after each interview, and a way of deciding when to stop collecting data. convergent interviews could become another useful qualitative research method to explore new issues about emerging marketing phenomena.
mouse model of pulmonary cavitary tuberculosis and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 active tuberculosis (tb) often presents with advanced pulmonary disease, including irreversible lung damage and cavities. cavitary pathology contributes to antibiotic failure, transmission, morbidity and mortality. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), in particular mmp‐1, are implicated in tb pathogenesis. we explored the mechanisms relating mmp/timp imbalance to cavity formation in a modified rabbit model of cavitary tb. our model resulted in consistent progression of consolidation to human‐like cavities (100% by day 28), with resultant bacillary burdens (>107 cfu/g) far greater than those found in matched granulomatous tissue (105 cfu/g). using a novel, breath‐hold computed tomography (ct) scanning and image analysis protocol, we showed that cavities developed rapidly from areas of densely consolidated tissue. radiological change correlated with a decrease in functional lung tissue, as estimated by changes in lung density during controlled pulmonary expansion (r2 = 0.6356, p < 0.0001). we demonstrated that the expression of interstitial collagenase (mmp‐1) was specifically greater in cavitary compared to granulomatous lesions (p < 0.01), and that timp‐3 significantly decreased at the cavity surface. our findings demonstrated that an mmp‐1/timp imbalance is associated with the progression of consolidated regions to cavities containing very high bacterial burdens. our model provided mechanistic insight, correlating with human disease at the pathological, microbiological and molecular levels. it also provided a strategy to investigate therapeutics in the context of complex tb pathology. we used these findings to predict a mmp/timp balance in active tb and confirmed this in human plasma, revealing the potential of mmp/timp levels as key components of a diagnostic matrix aimed at distinguishing active from latent tb (ppv = 92.9%, 95% ci 66.1–99.8%, npv = 85.6%; 95% ci 77.0–91.9%). copyright © 2014 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd

an agent-based occupancy simulator for building performance simulation: building occupancy is an important basic factor in building energy simulation but it is hard to represent due to its temporal and spatial stochastic nature. this paper presents a novel approach for building occupancy simulation based on the markov chain. in this study, occupancy is handled as the straightforward result of occupant movement processes which occur among the spaces inside and outside a building. by using the markov chain method to simulate this stochastic movement process, the model can generate the location for each occupant and the zone-level occupancy for the whole building. there is no explicit or implicit constraint to the number of occupants and the number of zones in the model while maintaining a simple and clear set of input parameters. from the case study of an office building, it can be seen that the model can produce realistic occupancy variations in the office building for a typical workday with key statistical properties of occupancy such as the time of morning arrival and night departure, lunch time, periods of intermediate walking-around, etc. due to simplicity, accuracy and unrestraint, this model is sufficient and practical to simulate occupancy for building energy simulations and stochastic analysis of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) systems.
high-throughput sequencing of human immunoglobulin variable regions with subtype identification background in the context of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), current findings suggest that the mucosal barrier is the major site of viral selection, transforming the complex inoculum to a small, homogeneous founder virus population. we analyzed hiv-1 transmission in relation to viral and host characteristics within the zurich primary hiv-1 infection study.   methods clonal hiv-1 envelope sequences (on average 16 clones/patient) were isolated from the first available plasma samples during the early phase of infection from 145 patients with primary hiv-1 infection. phylogenetic and tropism analyses were performed. differences of viral diversities were investigated in association with several parameters potentially influencing hiv-1 transmission, eg, concomitant sexually transmitted infections (stis) and mode of transmission.   results median viral diversity within env c2-v3-c3 region was 0.39% (range 0.04%-3.23%). viral diversity did not correlate with viral load, but it was slightly correlated with the duration of infection. neither transmission mode, gender, nor sti predicted transmission of more heterogeneous founder virus populations that were found in 16 of 145 patients (11%; diversity >1%). only 2 patients (1.4%) were assuredly infected with cxcr4-tropic hiv-1 within a r5/x4-tropic--mixed population, as revealed and confirmed using several genotypic prediction algorithms and phenotypic assays.   conclusions our findings suggest that transmission of multiple hiv-1 variants might be a complex process that is not dependent on mucosal factors alone. cxcr4-tropic viruses can be sexually transmitted in rare instances, but their clinical relevance remains to be determined.
optimization of molecular approaches to genogroup neisseria meningitidis carriage isolates and implications for monitoring the impact of new serogroup b vaccines background in 1999, meningococcal serogroup c conjugate (mcc) vaccines were introduced in the united kingdom for those under 19 years of age. the impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred.   methods multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping.   results a reduction in serogroup c carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (st)-11 complex serogroup c meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression.   conclusions the impact of vaccination with mcc vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group c meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. the high impact on the carriage of st-11 complex serogroup c could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. high vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups.
search tree unification: paradigm for process-based logic programs the notion that computation = controlled deduction was first proposed by pay hayes [19] and more recently by bibel [2] and vaughn-pratt [31]. a similar thesis that database systems should be regarded as consisting of a relational component, which defines the logic of the data, and a control component, which stores and retrieves it, has been successfully argued by codd [10]. hewitt's argument [20] for the programming language planner, though generally regarded as an argument against logic, can also be regarded as an argument for the thesis that algorithms be regarded as consisting of both logic and control components. in this paper we shall explore some of the useful consequences of that thesis.

predicting coral bleaching hotspots: the role of regional variability in thermal stress and potential adaptation rates [1] we present the met office hadley centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (sst) data set, hadisst1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (nmat) data set, hadmat1. hadisst1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (gisst) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of sst and sea ice concentration on a 1° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. the companion hadmat1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on nmat of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. hadisst1 and hadmat1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. the sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. ssts near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between sst and sea ice concentration. hadisst1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional sst well, containing sst fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in gisst. hadmat1 is more consistent with sst and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous nmat data sets.
serum uric acid is associated with high blood pressure in pediatric hemodialysis patients achieving dry weight during hemodialysis (hd) while minimizing symptoms is critical for optimizing patient outcome by preventing chronic fluid overload, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy. dry weight changes frequently in children because of growth and development and waxing and waning of appetite. we have previously shown non-invasive hematocrit monitoring (nivm) helps to decrease intradialytic symptoms, while still achieving target dry weights in children receiving chronic hd. in the current study, we prospectively evaluated an nivm-guided ultrafiltration (uf) management algorithm to determine target dry weight in nine pediatric patients (mean age 16.6±2.8 years, mean weight 41.6±11.1 kg). use of nivm could potentially lead to overly aggressive uf with increased interdialytic symptoms, post treatment thirst, and interdialytic weight gain (idwg). to evaluate the effectiveness of our nivm uf algorithm, we studied the effect of three different nivm-guided uf models (100%, 90%, and 80% uf models) on intradialytic and interdialytic symptoms, pre-/post-treatment blood pressure (bp), and percentage idwg. to assess interdialytic symptoms, patients completed two questionnaires, one for each day between treatments. no statistically significant difference was seen between the three uf models with respect to intradialytic or interdialytic symptoms, pre-/post-hd bp, or percentage idwg. only one of nine patients received non-acei chronic antihypertensive medication, yet all patients had pre- and post-hd bp <95th percentile for age and height. the current study suggests that routine determination of target dry weight using nivm and aiming for 100% uf helps to achieve the target dry weight, reduces both the risk of chronic fluid overload and the need for antihypertensive medication, and does not lead to increased intra- or interdialytic symptomatology in pediatric patients treated with chronic hd.
the contribution of rcts to quality management and their feasibility in practice background surgical investigations and interventions account for large health care utilisation and costs, but the scientific evidence for most procedures is still limited.   objectives degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine are variously described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease (which we regarded as one entity) and may be associated with back pain and associated leg symptoms, instability, spinal stenosis and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis. the objective of this review was to assess current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of surgical interventions for degenerative lumbar spondylosis.   search strategy we searched central, medline, pubmed, spine and issls abstracts, with citation tracking from the retrieved articles. we also corresponded with experts. all data found up to 31 march 2004 are included.   selection criteria randomised (rcts) or quasi-randomised trials of surgical treatment of lumbar spondylosis.   data collection and analysis two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers. additional information was sought from the authors if necessary.   main results thirty-one published rcts of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified. the trials varied in quality: only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization, blinding and independent assessment of outcome. most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome. more of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability, but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes. there was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years. seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions. two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results. one showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy, while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme. eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate (though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work), but did not improve clinical outcomes, while there is other evidence that it may be associated with higher complication rates. three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion. preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results. preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions.   authors' conclusions limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice. surgeons should be encouraged to perform further rcts in this field.
divergent muscle functional and architectural responses to two successive high intensity resistance exercise sessions in competitive weightlifters and resistance trained adults abstract‘explosive’ muscle strength or contractile rate of force development (rfd) is a term to describe the ability to rapidly develop muscular force, and can be measured as the slope of the torque–time curve obtained during isometric conditions. previously, conflicting results have been reported regarding the relationship between contractile rfd and various physiological parameters. one reason for this discrepancy may be that rfd in various time intervals from the onset of contraction is affected by different physiological parameters. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between voluntary contractile rfd in time intervals of 0–10, 0–20,..., 0–250 ms from the onset of contraction and two main parameters: (1) voluntary maximal muscle strength and (2) electrically evoked muscle twitch contractile properties. the main finding was that voluntary rfd became increasingly more dependent on mvc and less dependent on muscle twitch contractile properties as time from the onset of contraction increased. at time intervals later than 90 ms from the onset of contraction maximal muscle strength could account for 52–81% of the variance in voluntary rfd. in the very early time interval (<40 ms from the onset of contraction) voluntary rfd was moderately correlated to the twitch contractile properties of the muscle and was to a less extent related to mvc. the present results suggest that explosive movements with different time spans are influenced by different physiological parameters. this may have important practical implications when designing resistance training programs for specific sports.
impaired evoked and resting-state brain oscillations in patients with liver cirrhosis as revealed by magnetoencephalography☆☆☆ objective hepatic encephalopathy (he) is characterized by neuropsychological and motor deficits. the present study tested the hypothesis that worsening of motor and sensory symptoms of he results from a common basic deficit in the cerebral oscillatory processing within the human motor and visual system.   methods we investigated in 32 patients with liver cirrhosis and he grades 0-2 critical flicker frequency (cff) and cortico-muscular (m1-emg) coherence as a measure of coupling between the surface emgs of hand muscles and primary motor cortex (m1) activity recorded non-invasively with magnetoencephalography (meg) during forearm elevation.   results patients with he-grade 2 developed excessive m1-emg coherence at low frequencies. in contrast, maximum m1-emg coherence in patients with no he showed frequency and amplitude in the physiological range. cff was continuously reduced with worsening grades of he. correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between the frequency of m1-emg coherence and cff.   conclusions taken together, we demonstrate that increased grades of he lead to a pathological m1-emg drive which is reduced in frequency. these effects are correlated with an impaired perception of oscillatory visual stimuli.   significance the results suggest that pathological oscillatory neural processing in different human cerebral systems may represent a basic mechanism for the clinical manifestation of he.
chiral field theories from conifolds abstract we discuss some aspects of the physics of branes in the presence of orientifolds and the corresponding world-volume gauge dynamics. we show that at strong coupling orientifolds sometimes turn into bound states of orientifolds and branes, and give a world-sheet argument for the flip of the sign of an orientifold plane split into two disconnected parts by an ns5-brane. we also describe the moduli space of vacua of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups, and analyze a set of four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories with chiral matter content using branes.
knowledge graph exploration for natural language understanding in web information retrieval an empirical evaluation of models of text document similarity michael d. lee (michael.lee@adelaide.edu.au) department of psychology, university of adelaide south australia, 5005, australia brandon pincombe (brandon.pincombe@dsto.defence.gov.au) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance division, defence science and technology organisation po box 1500, edinburgh sa 5111 australia matthew welsh (matthew.welsh@adelaide.edu.au) australian school of petroleum engineering, university of adelaide south australia, 5005, australia abstract modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments presents a significant theoretical challenge for cognitive science, with ready-made applications in in- formation handling and decision support systems deal- ing with text. while a number of candidate models exist, they have generally not been assessed in terms of their ability to emulate human judgments of simi- larity. to address this problem, we conducted an ex- periment that collected repeated similarity measures for each pair of documents in a small corpus of short news documents. an analysis of human performance showed inter-rater correlations of about 0.6. we then considered the ability of existing models—using word- based, n-gram and latent semantic analysis (lsa) approaches—to model these human judgments. the best performed lsa model produced correlations of about 0.6, consistent with human performance, while the best performed word-based and n-gram models achieved correlations closer to 0.5. many of the re- maining models showed almost no correlation with hu- man performance. based on our results, we provide some discussion of the key strengths and weaknesses of the models we examined. introduction modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments is an interesting problem for cognitive science, for both theoretical and practical reasons. theoret- ically, it involves the study of a basic cognitive pro- cess with richly structured natural stimuli. practically, search engines, text corpus visualizations, and a vari- ety of other applications for filtering, sorting, retriev- ing, and generally handling text rely fundamentally on similarity measures. for this reason, the ability to as- sess semantic similarity in an accurate, automated, and scalable way is a key determinant of the effectiveness of most information handling and decision support soft- ware that deals with text. a variety of different approaches have been devel- oped for modeling text document similarity. these in- clude simple word-based, keyword-based and n-gram measures (e.g., salton, 1989; damashek, 1995), and more complicated approaches such as latent seman- tic analysis (lsa: deerwester et al., 1990; landauer and dumais, 1997). while all of these approaches have achieved some level of practical success, they have gen- erally not been assessed in terms of their ability to model human judgments of text document similarity. the most likely reason for this failure is that no suit- able empirical data exist, and considerable effort is in- volved in collecting pairwise ratings of text document similarity for even a moderate number of documents. this paper reports the collection of data that give ten independent ratings of the similarity of every pair of 50 short text documents, and so represents an attempt to establish a ‘psychological ground truth’ for evaluating models. using the new data, we report a first eval- uation of the ability of word-based, n-gram and lsa approaches to model human judgments. experiment materials the text corpus evaluated by human judges contained 50 documents selected from the australian broadcast- ing corporation’s news mail service, which provides text e-mails of headline stories. the documents varied in length from 51 to 126 words, and covered a number of broad topics. a further 314 documents from the same were collected to act as a larger ‘backgrounding’ corpus for lsa. both document sets were assessed against a stan- dard corpus of five english texts using four models of language. these were the log-normal, generalized in- verse gauss-poisson (with γ = −0.5), yule-simon and zipfian models (baayen, 2001). both document sets were within the normal range of english text for word frequency spectrum and vocabulary growth and were therefore regarded as representative of normal english texts. subjects the subjects were 83 university of adelaide students (29 males and 54 females), with a mean age of 19.7 years. they were each paid with a ten (australian) dollar gift voucher for every 100 document pair ratings made.
accurate camera calibration from multi-view stereo and bundle adjustment we show that surface reconstruction from oriented points can be cast as a spatial poisson problem. this poisson formulation considers all the points at once, without resorting to heuristic spatial partitioning or blending, and is therefore highly resilient to data noise. unlike radial basis function schemes, our poisson approach allows a hierarchy of locally supported basis functions, and therefore the solution reduces to a well conditioned sparse linear system. we describe a spatially adaptive multiscale algorithm whose time and space complexities are proportional to the size of the reconstructed model. experimenting with publicly available scan data, we demonstrate reconstruction of surfaces with greater detail than previously achievable.
redefining the differences in gene content between yersinia pestis and yersinia pseudotuberculosis using large-scale comparative genomics the blast programs are widely used tools for searching protein and dna databases for sequence similarities. for protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the blast programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. a new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped blast program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. in addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by blast into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. the resulting position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped blast, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. psi-blast is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the brct superfamily.
effect of pain and mild cognitive impairment on mobility background the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (mci) and mobility limitations is high among older adults. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between mci status and both performance-based and self-report measures of mobility in community-dwelling older adults.   methods an analysis was conducted on baseline data from the boston rehabilitative impairment study in the elderly study, a cohort study of 430 primary care patients aged 65 or older. neuropsychological tests identified participants with mci and further subclassified those with impairment in memory domains (amci), nonmemory domains (namci), and multiple domains (mdmci). linear regression models were used to assess the association between mci status and mobility performance in the habitual gait speed, figure of 8 walk, short physical performance battery, and self-reported late life function and disability instrument's basic lower extremity and advanced lower extremity function scales.   results participants had a mean age of 76.6 years, and 42% were characterized with mci. participants with mci performed significantly worse than participants without mci (no-mci) on all performance and self-report measures (p < .01). all mci subtypes performed significantly worse than no-mci on all mobility measures (p < .05) except for amci versus no-mci on the figure of 8 walk (p = .054) and basic lower extremity (p = .11). moreover, compared with amci, mdmci manifested worse performance on the figure of 8 walk and short physical performance battery, and namci manifested worse performance on short physical performance battery and basic lower extremity.   conclusions among older community-dwelling primary care patients, performance on a broad range of mobility measures was worse among those with mci, appearing poorest among those with nonmemory mci.
muscle pump-dependent self-perfusion mechanism in legs in normal subjects and patients with heart failure. summaryxamoterol acts as aβ1-adrenoceptor agonist at low sympathetic activity and as an antagonist at high activity. although its long-term efficacy has been proven in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, it remains unclear which effect, agonism or antagonism, accounts for its long-term activity.to clarify the effect of xamoterol on cardiac sympathetic activity in daily life, 24-h r-r interval histograms were obtained during administration of xamoterol 100 mg b. d. for 1 week to 10 patients with mild to moderate heart failure. eight normal subjects were also studied as controls. to examine the relation between the effect of xamoterol and sympathetic activity, plasma noradrenaline (na) levels were measured under 5 graded conditions simulating daily living.xamoterol administration significantly decreased the standard deviation of the r-r interval, both in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects. the mean r-r interval, however, was increased in patients with heart failure, relative to normal subjects.in both groups, the r-r interval histograms had two peaks, i. e. a short daytime peak and a long night-time peak. xamoterol decreased the median of the night-time peak without changing the daytime peak in normal subjects. in contrast, it increased the median of the daytime peak without producing a significant change in the nighttime peak in patients with heart failure. levels of plasma na were significantly higher in patients than in normal subjects under all conditions.thus, in normal subjects xamoterol predominantly increased the slower heart rate at night with only a minor effect on the higher heart rate in the daytime, whereas it predominantly attenuated the daytime tachycardia induced by sympathetic stimulation in patients with heart failure.it is concluded that xamoterol tends overall to act as aβ-adrenoceptor antagonist during the day, especially in the daytime in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. its antagonist rather than its agonist effect may account for the long-term efficacy of xamoterol in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.
commensal bacteria and mamps are necessary for stress-induced increases in il-1β and il-18 but not il-6, il-10 or mcp-1 motivation biological sequence data is accumulating rapidly, motivating the development of improved high-throughput methods for sequence classification.   results ublast and usearch are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. they are often orders of magnitude faster than blast in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. uclust is a new clustering method that exploits usearch to assign sequences to clusters. uclust offers several advantages over the widely used program cd-hit, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.   availability binaries are available at no charge for non-commercial use at http://www.drive5.com/usearch.
treatment prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia in quebec using a population health services perspective: different algorithms, different estimates simple interval estimate methods for proportions exhibit poor coverage and can produce evidently inappropriate intervals. criteria appropriate to the evaluation of various proposed methods include: closeness of the achieved coverage probability to its nominal value; whether intervals are located too close to or too distant from the middle of the scale; expected interval width; avoidance of aberrations such as limits outside [0,1] or zero width intervals; and ease of use, whether by tables, software or formulae. seven methods for the single proportion are evaluated on 96,000 parameter space points. intervals based on tail areas and the simpler score methods are recommended for use. in each case, methods are available that aim to align either the minimum or the mean coverage with the nominal 1 -alpha.
perceptual learning: 12-month-olds' discrimination of monkey faces. experience plays a crucial role for the normal development of many perceptual and cognitive functions, such as speech perception. for example, between 6 and 10 months of age, the infant's ability to discriminate among native speech sounds improves, whereas the ability to discriminate among foreign speech sounds declines. however, a recent investigation suggests that some experience with non-native languages from 9 months of age facilitates the maintenance of this ability at 12 months. nelson has suggested that the systems underlying face processing may be similarly sculpted by experience with different kinds of faces. in the current investigation, we demonstrate that, in human infants between 6 and 9 months of age, exposure to non-native faces, in this case, faces of barbary macaques (macaca sylvanus), facilitates the discrimination of monkey faces, an ability that is otherwise lost around 9 months of age. these data support, and further elucidate, the role of early experience in the development of face processing.
power system state estimation via feasible point pursuit state estimation (se) is an important task allowing power networks to monitor accurately the underlying system state, which is useful for security-constrained dispatch and power system control. for nonlinear ac power systems, se amounts to minimizing a weighted least-squares cost that is inherently nonconvex, thus giving rise to many local optima. as a result, estimators used extensively in practice rely on iterative optimization methods, which are destined to return only locally optimal solutions, or even fail to converge. a semidefinite programming (sdp) formulation for se has been advocated, which relies on the convex semidefinite relaxation (sdr) of the original problem and thereby renders it efficiently solvable. theoretical analysis under simplified conditions is provided to shed light on the near-optimal performance of the sdr-based se solution at polynomial complexity. the new approach is further pursued toward complementing traditional nonlinear measurements with linear synchrophasor measurements and reducing computational complexity through distributed implementations. numerical tests on the standard ieee 30- and 118-bus systems corroborate that the se algorithms outperform existing alternatives, and approach near-optimal performance.
do conflict resolution and recovery predict the survival of adolescents' romantic relationships? preliminary psychometric data are presented for two inventories that assess conflict in couples. the ineffective arguing inventory (iai) is a self-report measure that assesses a dysfunctional style of couple conflict resolution. the conflict resolution style inventory (crsi) has complementary self-report and partner-report versions that assess four personal conflict resolution styles for each member of the couple. subjects were both partners of 75 gay, 51 lesbian, 108 married non-parent, and 99 married parent couples. findings for each inventory are presented regarding the factor structure of items, the internal consistency of composite scores, the 1-year stability of composite scores, the relation between couple members' composite scores, and the link between composite scores and relationship satisfaction, change in satisfaction, and relationship dissolution. generally, results warrant further examination of the iai and crsi as measures of conflict for couples. all couples have to deal with conflict. further, how that conflict is managed is linked to relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (gottman, 1994; heavey, layne, & christensen, 1993; markman, renick, floyd, stanley, & clements, 1993; noller & white, 1990). to date, perhaps the most productive method for studying relationship conflict has been to code videotapes of partner conversations for small samples of couples in a laboratory setting (e.g., gottman, 1994). without denying the value of these behavioral observations--in particular, for assessing sequences of couples' interactional styles during conflict--the present study is based on the premise that self-report and partner-report methodologies are also valuable ways to study couple conflict and may complement observational methodologies. one of the major limitations of observational studies of couple conflict is that they utilize very small, nonrepresentative samples. in fact, some of the inconsistent findings in observational studies regarding the types of conflict resolution strategies that are linked to declines in relationship satisfaction over time have been attributed to biased samples (gottman, 1993). the availability of psychometrically sound self-report and partner-report measures of conflict resolution would help address this limitation by providing researchers with one method by which the link between conflict resolution and both relationship maintenance and relationship dissolution could be studied in large, representative samples. some measures of couple conflict are available, including self-report measures of couple conflict resolution patterns (e.g., the problem-solving communication scale of the marital satisfaction inventory; snyder, 1981), self-report measures of individual conflict resolution styles (e.g., the marital coping inventory, bowman, 1990), and self-report and partner-report measures of each partner's conflict resolution styles (e.g., the interpersonal communication skills inventory; boyd & roach, 1977) as well as sequences of partners' conflict resolution styles (e.g., the communication patterns questionnaire; christensen, 1988). however, no measure of couple conflict resolution could be found that was brief, was based on a coherent conceptual framework, and had comprehensively documented psychometric properties. documenting psychometric properties include validating the measure against the major relationship outcomes used in behavioral observations in this area of study--relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (gottman, 1994; gottman & krokoff, 1989; markman et al., 1993). accordingly, the purpose of this article is to present such preliminary psychometric data for two brief nonobservational measures of couple conflict. the first measure--the ineffective arguing inventory (iai)--assesses how the couple handles conflict, whereas the second measure the conflict resolution styles inventory (crsi)--assesses each partner's individual style of handling conflict. …
self-organizing map based web pages clustering using web logs this article describes the implementation of a system that is able to organize vast document collections according to textual similarities. it is based on the self-organizing map (som) algorithm. as the feature vectors for the documents statistical representations of their vocabularies are used. the main goal in our work has been to scale up the som algorithm to be able to deal with large amounts of high-dimensional data. in a practical experiment we mapped 6,840,568 patent abstracts onto a 1,002,240-node som. as the feature vectors we used 500-dimensional vectors of stochastic figures obtained as random projections of weighted word histograms.
mitochondrial creatine kinase activity and phosphate shuttling are acutely regulated by exercise in human skeletal muscle the hypothesis that the aging process is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress has been investigated in human skeletal muscle. muscle biopsy samples were taken from seven old male subjects [os; 75 (range 61–86) years] and eight young male subjects [ys; 25 (22–31) years]. oxidative function was measured both in permeabilised muscle fibres and isolated mitochondria. despite matching the degree of physical activity, os had a lower training status than ys as judged from pulmonary maximal o2 consumption (v̇o2max, −36%) and handgrip strength (−20%). both maximal respiration and creatine-stimulated respiration were reduced in muscle fibres from os (−32 and −34%, respectively). in contrast, respiration in isolated mitochondria was similar in os and ys. the discrepancy might be explained by a biased harvest of "healthy" mitochondria and/or disruption of structural components during the process of isolation. cytochrome c oxidase was reduced (−40%, p<0.01), whereas ucp3 protein tended to be elevated in os (p=0.09). generation of reactive oxygen species by isolated mitochondria and measures of antioxidative defence (muscle content of glutathione, glutathione redox status, antioxidative enzymes activity) were not significantly different between os and ys. it is concluded that aging is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which appears to be unrelated to reduced physical activity. the hypothesis of increased oxidative stress in aged muscle could not be confirmed in this study.
non-negative spherical deconvolution (nnsd) for estimation of fiber orientation distribution function in single-/multi-shell diffusion mri we present a method for the estimation of various features of the tissue micro-architecture using the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. the considered features are designed from the displacement probability density function (pdf). the estimation is based on two steps: first the approximation of the signal by a series expansion made of gaussian-laguerre and spherical harmonics functions; followed by a projection on a finite dimensional space. besides, we propose to tackle the problem of the robustness to rician noise corrupting in-vivo acquisitions. our feature estimation is expressed as a variational minimization process leading to a variational framework which is robust to noise. this approach is very flexible regarding the number of samples and enables the computation of a large set of various features of the local tissues structure. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with results on both synthetic phantom and real mr datasets acquired in a clinical time-frame.
yoga as steadiness training: effects on motor variability in young adults purpose to determine the contribution of visuomotor correction to increased force fluctuations in the elbow flexor and knee extensor muscles of elderly adults.   methods young (n = 22, 23 +/- 3 yr) and elderly (n = 23, 74 +/- 7 yr) adults performed constant-force contractions at target forces of 2.5, 30, and 65% mvc. visual feedback was provided (6-8 s) and then removed (6-8 s). after removal of drift (< 0.5 hz) from the force, the standard deviation (sd) and coefficient of variation (cv) of force were calculated from vision and no-vision data.   results maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) force was 19% lower for elbow flexors and 37% lower for knee extensors in elderly adults than in young adults. overall, the cv of force was 27% greater in the vision condition compared with the no-vision condition. the cv of force for vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults at the 2.5% mvc target force and lower at 30 and 65% mvc. for the 2.5% mvc target force, the decline in cv of force from vision to no vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults. at 30 and 65% mvc, the decline was significant but similar for young and elderly adults. for elbow flexors, the change in power from vision to no vision was greater for 0- to 4-hz (reduced power) and 8- to 12-hz (increased power) frequencies for elderly adults compared with young adults.   conclusion visuomotor correction contributed to force fluctuations in large proximal muscles. the contribution was greater for healthy elderly adults at low forces. visuomotor processes thus contributed to the age-related increase in force fluctuations.
the inverse relation between risks and benefits: the role of affect and expertise. hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. we provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. we present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. we also provide sas and spss macros, as well as mplus and lisrel syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.
long-term consumption of fish oil-enriched diet impairs serotonin hypophagia in rats objective using rats we examined whether maternal intake of hydrogenated fat rich in trans fatty acids affects brain fatty acid profile, hypothalamic content of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 proteins, and the hypophagic effect of centrally administered insulin in 3-mo-old male progeny.   methods throughout pregnancy and lactation, wistar rats ate isocaloric/normolipidic diets with soybean oil (control) or soybean oil-derived hydrogenated fat (trans diet) as a fat source. upon weaning, the trans offspring continued on the trans diet (trans group) or were switched to a control diet (trans-control group).   results compared with control rats, trans rats had lower brain levels of eicosapentaenoic acid. compared with trans rats, trans-control rats had increased levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid and decreased levels of trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids. insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 levels were significantly lower (44% and 38%, respectively) in trans than in control rats. in trans-control rats, insulin receptor was 26% lower (p < 0.05), whereas insulin receptor substrate-1 was 50% lower, than in control rats. insulin decreased 24-h feeding in control (27%) and trans (38%) rats but failed to do so in trans-control rats. the latter group had increased serum glucose levels.   conclusions the data suggest that the early (intrauterine/perinatal) exposure to hydrogenated fat rich in trans fatty acids programmed the hypothalamic feeding control mechanisms. as young adults, only trans-control animals showed loss of insulin-induced hypophagia, indicating that the mismatch between early and later nutritional environments was relevant. however, the trans group also showed signs of altered appetite signaling mechanisms, suggesting that the early adaptations may have deleterious consequences later in life.
empirical study to find factors influencing e-filing adoption in india abstract. electronic government, or e‐government, increases the convenience and accessibility of government services and information to citizens. despite the benefits of e‐government – increased government accountability to citizens, greater public access to information and a more efficient, cost‐effective government – the success and acceptance of e‐government initiatives, such as online voting and licence renewal, are contingent upon citizens’ willingness to adopt this innovation. in order to develop ‘citizen‐centred’ e‐government services that provide participants with accessible, relevant information and quality services that are more expedient than traditional ‘brick and mortar’ transactions, government agencies must first understand the factors that influence citizen adoption of this innovation. this study integrates constructs from the technology acceptance model, diffusions of innovation theory and web trust models to form a parsimonious yet comprehensive model of factors that influence citizen adoption of e‐government initiatives. the study was conducted by surveying a broad diversity of citizens at a community event. the findings indicate that perceived ease of use, compatibility and trustworthiness are significant predictors of citizens’ intention to use an e‐government service. implications of this study for research and practice are presented.
nais: neural attentive item similarity model for recommendation we present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. we describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. we give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. we experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
a market-based approach to recommender systems we have designed, implemented, deployed and evaluated a large-scale agent-oriented information system that recommends relevant documents to users. our recommender system is now being used across several european institutions. its two key features are a modular design capable of accomodating multiple recommendation methods, and the use of a marketplace to select and rank the best recommendations for the user. as part of our evaluation, we have extensively simulated this marketplace in order to understand its dynamics and validate its suitability for a reeommender system.
modifications of machine translation evaluation metrics by using word embeddings a goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. this is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. we propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. the model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. we report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.
eicosapentaenoic acid combined with optimal statin therapy improves endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease endothelial function is thought to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension and heart failure. in the 1990s, high-frequency ultrasonographic imaging of the brachial artery to assess endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation (fmd) was developed. the technique provokes the release of nitric oxide, resulting in vasodilation that can be quantitated as an index of vasomotor function. the noninvasive nature of the technique allows repeated measurements over time to study the effectiveness of various interventions that may affect vascular health. however, despite its widespread use, there are technical and interpretive limitations of this technique. state-of-the-art information is presented and insights are provided into the strengths and limitations of high-resolution ultrasonography of the brachial artery to evaluate vasomotor function, with guidelines for its research application in the study of endothelial physiology.
effect of of atp on neurons of the rat intact nodose ganglion the effects of divalent cations on responses to 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐ht), gamma‐aminobutyric acid (gaba) and 1,1‐dimethyl‐4‐phenyl piperazinium (dmpp) were investigated using a sucrose‐gap method to record population responses. in ca‐free medium responses to 5‐ht were enhanced, those to dmpp depressed and those to gaba unchanged. in mg‐free medium responses to 5‐ht were unchanged, while those to dmpp and gaba were depressed. removal of both ca and mg from the superfusion medium caused a small reduction of gaba responses and a large reduction of dmpp responses. responses to 5‐ht were not only greatly potentiated but were changed in character; the depolarizing phase became sigmoid and the dose dependence between quantity of 5‐ht and response magnitude was lost as if 5‐ht were triggering an all‐or‐nothing phenomenon. dose‐‐response relationships for gaba were normal in the large majority of preparations. in about 10% of preparations, supramaximal amounts of gaba or dmpp evoked large responses of a similar character to those evoked by 5‐ht. the large responses, generated by an unknown mechanism, were termed x responses. further reduction in tissue divalent cations by egta (1 mm) caused x responses to be generated spontaneously. ca, mg, mn or co (1 mm) could suppress x responses. dmpp responses, reduced in ca/mg‐free medium, were largely restored by 1 mm‐ca. depression of gaba responses in ca/mg‐free medium could be entirely attributed to the absence of mg, mn being able to substitute for mg. x responses were generated only after equilibration for 1 h with ca/mg‐free medium. attempts to manipulate [ca]i with dinitrophenol or caffeine did not produce the conditions under which x responses were generated. intracellular records of responses to 5‐ht, gaba or dmpp showed that cells with a fibres responded to gaba but not to 5‐ht or dmpp. fifty‐four out of sixty‐seven cells with c fibre axons (80%) were depolarized by 5‐ht, thirty‐seven out of forty‐nine (76%) by dmpp and forty out of fifty‐seven (70%) by gaba. eighteen out of thirty‐eight (47%) c cells were depolarized by all three agents. some c cells were very sensitive to 5‐ht, 10(‐6) m evoking a substantial response. in most, responses to 10(‐5) m‐5‐ht had a slower rate of rise than responses to 10(‐4) or 10(‐3) m‐gaba or dmpp, yet lower 5‐ht concentrations normally elicited x responses in sucrose‐gap experiments whereas gaba or dmpp normally did not.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
perceptions of environmental opportunities for physical activity in the european union physically active lifestyles are regularly associated with improved health and quality of life. differences in lifestyles in society can partly be understood through the differences in the social and physical environment. this study examines the relationships between reported physical activity, and the extent of perceived support for physical activity in the physical and policy environment (e.g. facilities, programmes and other opportunities), and in the social environment. the data for the study come from a cross-cultural health policy study called mareps. in total, 3342 adults, 18 years or older, from six countries (belgium, finland, germany, the netherlands, spain, switzerland) were interviewed via telephone. respondents were categorised as active or inactive according to self-reported physical activity. social environmental factors and physical and policy environmental factors were also assessed. the analysis of the data was informed by social cognitive theory, although the study was not originally designed for this purpose. sixty-eight percent of females and 70% of males were active. the proportions of active and inactive varied by countries to a great extent. the strongest independent predictor of being physically active was social environment. those who perceived low social support from their personal environment (i.e. family, friends, school and workplace) were more than twice as likely to be sedentary compared to those who reported high social support from their personal environment. specific knowledge of the programmes and actions for physical activity and sport was also a strong predictor of being active. a supportive physical and policy environment was not associated with participation in physical activity as strongly as had been anticipated. the variation between countries was stronger predictor of being active than the physical and policy environment variables. this study generates the hypotheses and raises the questions that in a preliminary way, there appears to be some relationships between aspects of physical and social environment and physical activity participation. however, future research is needed to refine and clarify this.
gene-environment interaction in the etiology of mathematical ability using snp sets the twins early development study (teds) focuses on the early development of the three most common psychological problems in childhood: communication disorders, mild mental impairment and behavior problems. the teds twins were assessed longitudinally at 2, 3, 4 and 7 years of age in order to investigate genetic and environmental contributions to change and continuity in language and cognitive development; it is multivariate in order to examine the origins of comorbidity; and it uses a large sample in order to study abnormal development in the context of normal development. the twins were identified from birth records of twins born in the uk in 1994-96. more than 15,000 pairs of twins have been enrolled in teds and the participating families are representative of the uk. the measures at 2, 3 and 4 years are administered by parents. at 7 years, children are assessed for language and cognitive development using telephone testing, parents and children are interviewed about behavior problems, and teachers also assess behavior problems as well as academic achievement. one set of findings is that the same genes largely contribute to both language and cognitive problems and the same genes affect normal and abnormal development, a result that suggests that general impairment may be a better target for genetic research than specific language impairment independent of nonverbal cognitive problems. dna has been obtained so far for more than 4000 pairs and is being used initially in molecular genetic studies of language problems and hyperactivity.
metamorphic testing for software quality assessment: a study of search engines metamorphic testing (mt) is an effective methodology for testing those so-called ``non-testable'' programs (e.g., scientific programs), where it is sometimes very difficult for testers to know whether the outputs are correct. in metamorphic testing, metamorphic relations (mrs) (which specify how particular changes to the input of the program under test would change the output) play an essential role. however, testers may typically have to obtain mrs manually. in this paper, we propose a search-based approach to automatic inference of polynomial mrs for a program under test. in particular, we use a set of parameters to represent a particular class of mrs, which we refer to as polynomial mrs, and turn the problem of inferring mrs into a problem of searching for suitable values of the parameters. we then dynamically analyze multiple executions of the program, and use particle swarm optimization to solve the search problem. to improve the quality of inferred mrs, we further use mr filtering to remove some inferred mrs. we also conducted three empirical studies to evaluate our approach using four scientific libraries (including 189 scientific functions). from our empirical results, our approach is able to infer many high-quality mrs in acceptable time (i.e., from 9.87 seconds to 1231.16 seconds), which are effective in detecting faults with no false detection.
association between maternal depression symptoms across the first eleven years of their child’s life and subsequent offspring suicidal ideation the development of a 10-item self-report scale (epds) to screen for postnatal depression in the community is described. after extensive pilot interviews a validation study was carried out on 84 mothers using the research diagnostic criteria for depressive illness obtained from goldberg's standardised psychiatric interview. the epds was found to have satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, and was also sensitive to change in the severity of depression over time. the scale can be completed in about 5 minutes and has a simple method of scoring. the use of the epds in the secondary prevention of postnatal depression is discussed.
converting redox signaling to apoptotic activities by stress-responsive regulators hsf1 and nrf2 in fenretinide treated cancer cells we describe a powerful approach, component plane presentation integrated self‐organizing map (som), for the analysis of microarray data. this approach allows the display of multi‐dimensional som outputs of microarray data in multiple sample specific presentations, providing distinct advantages in visual inspection of biological significances of genes clustered in each map unit with respect to each rna sample. beneficial potentials of the approach are highlighted by processing microarray data from yeast cells as well as human breast malignancies.
adaptive management in agricultural innovation systems: the interactions between innovation networks and their environment transforum is an innovation program which aims to make a substantial contribution to the transition towards more sustainable development of the dutch agricultural sector. this article describes the scientific foundation and architecture of this program. transforum operates on the basis of five working hypotheses which together constitute one integrated analytical framework. these hypotheses are: (1) sustainable development is a dynamic system property; (2) sustainable development needs system innovation; (3) system innovation is a non-linear learning process; (4) system innovation requires active participation of relevant key players from knowledge institutes, governmental bodies, civil society organisations and the business community; (5) the program requires transdisciplinary collaboration of all players. transforum identifies three new innovation strategies: (1) vital clusters; (2) regional development; (3) international agro-food networks; as alternatives to the current arrangements. innovative projects are organised in these innovation strategies. the aim of the scientific program is threefold: (1) it addresses research questions raised in the innovative projects; (2) it investigates the need for system-innovations and the way in which they can be realized; (3) it designs research projects to test the 5 main working hypotheses of the program. the scientific program is organised in four themes following a cyclic innovation process which is constantly monitored. the cycle starts with people’s preferences and images, followed by studies on which inventions are required to achieve a successful innovation. subsequently, it is investigated how to organize new innovations and transitions and finally, how citizen/consumers behaviour and preferences mobilizes sustainable development, closing the loop.
improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
cardiorespiratory fitness in breast cancer patients: a call for normative values doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was used as a model to prospectively investigate neuroendocrine changes during the development of left ventricular dysfunction. radionuclide ventriculography, frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability (hrv), and plasma noradrenaline and natriuretic peptide measurements were performed in 27 adult lymphoma patients at baseline and after cumulative doxorubicin doses of 200, 400 and 500 mg/m(2). the left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) decreased from 58.1+/-1.4% to 50.3+/-1.1% (p<0.001) and 49.3+/-1.7% (p<0.001) after cumulative doxorubicin doses of 400 and 500 mg/m(2) respectively. with a doxorubicin dose of up to 400 mg/m(2) there was an increase in sympathetic tone, characterized by a decrease in the normalized high-frequency (hf(nu)) power (p=0.011), and increases in the normalized low-frequency (lf(nu)) power (p=0.011), the lf/hf ratio (p=0.021) and the plasma noradrenaline concentration (p=0.034). the decrease in lvef was correlated with the changes in lf(nu) and hf(nu) power (r=0.540, p=0.012) and lf/hf ratio (r=-0.452, p=0.04). however, after the cumulative doxorubicin dose of 500 mg/m(2) the changes in hrv components and plasma noradrenaline levels returned towards baseline. this was accompanied by increased concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (p=0.004) and brain natriuretic peptide (p=0.021). our findings suggest that doxorubicin-induced left ventricular dysfunction is associated with an early change in sympathovagal balance towards sympathetic predominance. along with further progression of left ventricular dysfunction, there is an attenuation of sympathetic tone, which may be attributable to sympatho-adrenal inhibition by increased secretion of natriuretic peptides.
serotonin passes through myoendothelial gap junctions to promote pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell differentiation. myoendothelial gap junctions are involved in regulating systemic arterial smooth muscle cell phenotype and function, but their role in the regulation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (pasmc) phenotype is unknown. we therefore investigated in cocultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (paecs) and pasmcs whether myoendothelial gap junctional signaling played a role in paec-dependent regulation of pasmc phenotype. rat paecs and pasmcs were cocultured on opposite sides of a porous transwell membrane that permitted formation of heterotypic cell-cell contacts. immunostaining showed expression of the gap junctional protein connexin 43 (cx43) on projections extending into the membrane from both cell types. dye transfer exhibited functional gap junctional communication from paecs to pasmcs. pasmcs cocultured with paecs had a more contractile-like phenotype (spindle shape and increased expression of the contractile proteins myosin heavy chain, h1-calponin, and α-smooth muscle cell-actin) than pasmcs cocultured with pasmcs or cocultured without direct contact with paecs. transforming growth factor (tgf)-β1 signaling was activated in pasmcs cocultured with paecs, and the pasmc differentiation was inhibited by tgf-β type i receptor blockade. inhibition of gap junctional communication pharmacologically or by knock down of cx43 in paecs blocked tgf-β signaling and pasmc differentiation. these results implicate myoendothelial gap junctions as a gateway for paec-derived signals required for maintaining tgf-β-dependent pasmc differentiation. this study identifies an alternative pathway to paracrine signaling to convey regulatory signals from paecs to pasmcs and raises the possibility that dysregulation of this direct interaction is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertensive pulmonary vascular remodeling.
age estimation based on a single network with soft softmax of aging modeling !, model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. it is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. the problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. we argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. we describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. these models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by active contour models (snakes). the key difference is that our active shape models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. we show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. q 199s a&& prrss, in.
african easterly waves during 2004—analysis using objective techniques abstract the existence of african easterly waves (aews) north of the african easterly jet (aej) core with maximum amplitude at low levels has been confirmed and clarified using radiosonde data and the u.k. meteorological office global model analysis from the hurricane season of 1995. at bamako (12.5°n, 8.0°w) the aews were characterized mainly by maximum amplitudes at the level of the aej (around 700 mb), whereas at dakar (14.7°n, 17.5°w) the waves were characterized by maxima between 850 and 950 mb. the low-level waves to the north of the aej arise in association with baroclinic interactions between the negative meridional potential vorticity (pv) gradients in the jet core and the positive low-level gradient of potential temperature, θ, enhanced by the presence of low-static-stability air north of the aej. these waves follow the positive meridional θ gradients over northern africa in contrast to the jet-level aews that follow the meridional pv gradients at the level of the aej. cross-correlation analysis...
impact of physical incompatibility on drug mass flow rates: example of furosemide-midazolam incompatibility background: multiaccess infusion sets allow multiple simultaneous infusions but may induce interference in drug delivery resulting from large variations in the delivery rate of potent drugs. in this study, we sought to understand the influence of multiaccess infusion device properties (dead space volume and antireflux valve [arv]) on drug delivery during multi-infusion therapy. methods: infusion sets differing in length, dead space volume, and presence of an arv were assessed. three drugs were infused simultaneously through different access points, and their concentrations were obtained using uv spectrophotometric analysis of the effluent. different infusion configurations were compared by assessing (1) the amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time, (2) the mean amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time during the steady-state infusion (mass flow rate plateau), and (3) flow change efficiency calculated from the ratio of the area under the experimental instant mass flow rate curve to the area corresponding to theoretical instant mass flow rate curve. results: infusion sets with lower dead space volumes offered significantly higher flow change efficiency (53.0% ± 15.4% with a dead space volume equal to 0.046 ml 5 min after the start of infusion) than infusion sets with higher dead space volume (5.6% ± 8.2% with a dead space volume equal to 6.16 ml), whatever the flow rate changes. even in case of large dead space volumes, the presence of an arv significantly increased the mass flow rate plateau (from 92.4% to 99.3% of the theoretical plateau without and with the presence of an arv, respectively). conclusions: multi-infusion therapy induces perturbation in drug delivery. these perturbations (lag time, backflow, and bolus) could be reduced by using infusion sets including very low dead space volume and an arv.
identification of targets of cug-bp, elav-like family member 1 (celf1) regulation in embryonic heart muscle microsatellite expansions cause a number of dominantly-inherited neurological diseases. expansions in coding-regions cause protein gain-of-function effects, while non-coding expansions produce toxic rnas that alter rna splicing activities of mbnl and celf proteins. bi-directional expression of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (sca8) ctg cag expansion produces cug expansion rnas (cugexp) from the atxn8os gene and a nearly pure polyglutamine expansion protein encoded by atxn8 cagexp transcripts expressed in the opposite direction. here, we present three lines of evidence that rna gain-of-function plays a significant role in sca8: 1) cugexp transcripts accumulate as ribonuclear inclusions that co-localize with mbnl1 in selected neurons in the brain; 2) loss of mbnl1 enhances motor deficits in sca8 mice; 3) sca8 cugexp transcripts trigger splicing changes and increased expression of the cugbp1-mbnl1 regulated cns target, gaba-a transporter 4 (gat4/gabt4). in vivo optical imaging studies in sca8 mice confirm that gabt4 upregulation is associated with the predicted loss of gabaergic inhibition within the granular cell layer. these data demonstrate that cugexp transcripts dysregulate mbnl/celf regulated pathways in the brain and provide mechanistic insight into the cns effects of other cugexp disorders. moreover, our demonstration that relatively short cugexp transcripts cause rna gain-of-function effects and the growing number of antisense transcripts recently reported in mammalian genomes suggest unrecognized toxic rnas contribute to the pathophysiology of polyglutamine cag ctg disorders.
post-treatment lyme disease syndrome symptomatology and the impact on life functioning: is there something here? evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis were prepared by an expert panel of the infectious diseases society of america. these updated guidelines replace the previous treatment guidelines published in 2000 (clin infect dis 2000; 31[suppl 1]:1-14). the guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have these infections or may be at risk for them. for each of these ixodes tickborne infections, information is provided about prevention, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. tables list the doses and durations of antimicrobial therapy recommended for treatment and prevention of lyme disease and provide a partial list of therapies to be avoided. a definition of post-lyme disease syndrome is proposed.
mechanisms of subcutaneous absorption of rituximab in rats the neonatal fc receptor (fcrn) plays an important and well-known role in immunoglobulin g (igg) catabolism; however, its role in the disposition of igg after subcutaneous (sc) administration, including bioavailability, is relatively unknown. to examine the potential effect of fcrn on igg sc bioavailability, we engineered three anti-amyloid β monoclonal antibody (mab) reverse chimeric mouse igg2a (migg2a) fc variants (i253a.h435a, n434h and n434y) with different binding affinities to mouse fcrn (mfcrn) and compared their sc bioavailability to that of the wild-type (wt) mab in mice. our results indicated that the sc bioavailability of migg2a was affected by mfcrn-binding affinity. variant i253a.h435a, which did not bind to mfcrn at either ph 6.0 or ph 7.4, had the lowest bioavailability (41.8%). variant n434y, which had the greatest increase in binding affinity at both ph 6.0 and ph 7.4, had comparable bioavailability to the wt antibody (86.1% vs. 76.3%), whereas variant n434h, which had modestly increased binding affinity at ph 6.0 to mfcrn and affinity comparable to the wt antibody at ph 7.4, had the highest bioavailability (94.7%). a semi-mechanism-based pharmacokinetic model, which described well the observed data with the wt antibody and variant i253a.h435a, is consistent with the hypothesis that the decreased bioavailability of variant i253a.h435a was due to loss of the fcrn-mediated protection from catabolism at the absorption site. together, these data demonstrate that fcrn plays an important role in sc bioavailability of therapeutic igg antibodies.
relating diseases by integrating gene associations and information flow through protein interaction network in our previous publication, a framework for information flow in interaction networks based on random walks with damping was formulated with two fundamental modes: emitting and absorbing. while many other network analysis methods based on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes. in addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier formalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein functions and pathways. however, the directed flow from origins to destinations was induced via a potential function that was heuristic. here, with a theoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier work for directed information flow. this is achieved by constructing a potential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the channel mode. for each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a channel tensor. the entries of the channel tensor at each node can be interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a destination. similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses damping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow. through examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate the versatility and stability of our new framework.
assessing the effects of native plants on the pollination of an exotic herb, the blueweed echium vulgare (boraginaceae) aims in ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate of total species richness because many rare species are not detected. moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. for individual-based data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area sampled. for sample-based incidence (presence–absence) data, under a bernoulli product model, we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling units. methods the first objective is a problem in interpolation that we address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and coleman rarefaction (poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based rarefaction (bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies. the second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial model), a larger area (poisson model) or a larger number of sampling units (bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic species richness. although published methods exist for many of these objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators under a unified statistical and notational framework. this novel integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. we provide new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based rarefaction and for coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit of biodiversity measurement. we illustrate these methods with datasets for tropical beetles, tropical trees and tropical ants.
self-regulatory failure and intimate partner violence perpetration. aggressive impulses arise from many factors, but they are usually held in check by social norms for self-control. thus, the proximal cause of aggression is often failure of self-restraint. in five studies, depleted capacity for self-regulation (caused by prior, even irrelevant acts of self-regulation) increased aggressive responding, especially after an insulting provocation. when participants were insulted and their self-regulatory strength was depleted (i.e., after completing previous tasks that required self-regulation), participants were more likely to aggress. when the urge to aggress was relatively weaker (i.e., when participants were not insulted), self-regulatory depletion did not increase aggressive behavior. this effect was moderated by trait self-control: participants low in trait self-control were particularly likely to express intentions of behaving aggressively in response to provocation, whereas participants high in trait self-control did not express intentions of responding aggressively. laboratory, autobiographical memory, and hypothetical responses confirmed the pattern.
depressive symptoms in the transition to menopause: the roles of irritability, personality vulnerability, and self-regulation a select group of investigators attended a structured workshop, the stages of reproductive aging workshop (straw), at park city, utah, usa, in july 2001, which addressed the need in women for a staging system as well as the confusing nomenclature for the reproductive years.
sleep-disordered breathing is a risk factor for delirium after cardiac surgery: a prospective cohort study background and objective:  osa is a common condition associated with cardiovascular (cv) morbidity. it remains underdiagnosed globally in part due to the limited availability and technical requirements of polysomnography (psg). the aim of this study was to test the accuracy of two simple methods for diagnosing osa.
synthetic lethals in hiv: ways to avoid drug resistance l-735,524 is a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) protease currently in a phase ii clinical trial. we report here the three-dimensional structure of l-735,524 complexed to hiv-2 protease at 1.9-a resolution, as well as the structure of the native hiv-2 protease at 2.5-a resolution. the structure of hiv-2 protease is found to be essentially identical to that of hiv-1 protease. in the crystal lattice of the hiv-2 protease complexed with l-735,524, the inhibitor is chelated to the active site of the homodimeric enzyme in one orientation. this feature allows an unambiguous assignment of protein-ligand interactions from the electron density map. both fourier and difference fourier maps reveal clearly the closure of the flap domains of the protease upon l-735,524 binding. specific interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitor include the hydroxy group of the hydroxyaminopentane amide moiety of l-735,524 ligating to the carboxyl groups of the essential asp-25 and asp-25' enzymic residues and the amide oxygens of the inhibitor hydrogen bonding to the backbone amide nitrogen of ile-50 and ile-50' via an intervening water molecule. a second bridging water molecule is found between the amide nitrogen n2 of l-735,524 and the carboxyl oxygen of asp-29'. although other hydrogen bonds also add to binding, an equally significant contribution to affinity arises from hydrophobic interactions between the protease and the inhibitor throughout the pseudo-symmetric s1/s1', s2/s2', and s3/s3' regions of the enzyme. except for its pyridine ring, all lipophilic moieties (t-butyl, indanyl, benzyl, and piperidyl) of l-735,524 are rigidly defined in the active site.
a two-stage pretreatment approach to maximise sugar yield and enhance reactive lignin recovery from poplar wood chips. an organosolv process involving extraction with hot aqueous ethanol has been evaluated for bioconversion of hybrid poplar to ethanol. the process resulted in fractionation of poplar chips into a cellulose‐rich solids fraction, an ethanol organosolv lignin (eol) fraction, and a water‐soluble fraction containing hemicellulosic sugars, sugar breakdown products, degraded lignin, and other components. the influence of four independent process variables (temperature, time, catalyst dose, and ethanol concentration) on product yields was analyzed over a broad range using a small composite design and response surface methodology. center point conditions for the composite design (180°c, 60 min, 1.25% h2so4, and 60% ethanol), yielded a solids fraction containing ∼88% of the cellulose present in the untreated poplar. approximately 82% of the total cellulose in the untreated poplar was recovered as monomeric glucose after hydrolysis of the solids fraction for 24 h using a low enzyme loading (20 filter paper units of cellulase/g cellulose); ∼85% was recovered after 48 h hydrolysis. total recovery of xylose (soluble and insoluble) was equivalent to ∼72% of the xylose present in untreated wood. approximately 74% of the lignin in untreated wood was recovered as eol. other cooking conditions resulted in either similar or inferior product yields although the distribution of components between the various fractions differed markedly. data analysis generated regression models that describe process responses for any combination of the four variables. © 2006 wiley periodicals, inc.
selecting inflation indicators under an inflation targeting regime: evidence from the mcl method the modified yule-walker technique of arma spectral estimation is shown to be a special case of the instrumental variable method of system identification. several recursive instrumental variable algorithms are proposed for adaptive spectral estimation. an efficient lattice algorithm is presented for solving the modified yule-walker equations in the overdetermined case.
intermuscular relationship of human muscle fiber type proportions: slow leg muscles predict slow neck muscles biopsies of ventral neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, and longus colli) and dorsal neck muscles (rectus capitis posterior major, obliquus capitis inferior, splenius capitis, and trapezius) were taken from 64 patients who underwent spondylodesis for cervical dysfunction of different etiologies. the muscle fibers were classified histochemically as type i, iia, iib, or iic (transitional or intermediate fibers) according to the ph lability of their myofibrillar atpase. signs of muscle fiber transformations were observed in all muscles investigated, as evidenced by an increased relative amount of type‐iic fibers. the transformations occurred independently of (a) the type of muscle (i.e., more “postural” or more “phasic”), (b) the sex and age of the patient, (c) the type of condition, and (d) the presence of additional neurological deficits. thus, the same pattern of muscular reaction was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as in patients with soft‐tissue injuries of the neck (e.g., “whiplash injury”). in the ventral muscles and the obliquus capitis inferior, the occurrence of transformations correlated strongly with the duration of symptoms; in the ventral muscles the vast majority of transformations were encountered in patients with a shorter history of symptoms, whereas in the obliquus capitis inferior the reverse occurred. in the other dorsal muscles, no correlation with the duration of symptoms was found. muscles in which transformations had ceased displayed, on average, a significantly higher percentage of fast type‐iib fibers than were found in muscles with ongoing transformations. this strongly indicates that the transformations proceeded in the direction from “slow oxidative” to “fast glycolytic”.
fiscal policies and credit regimes: a tvar approach: fiscal policies and credit regimes the problem of testing for linearity and the number of regimes in the context of self-exciting threshold autoregressive (setar) models is reviewed. we describe least-squares methods of estimation and inference. the primary complication is that the testing problem is non-standard, due to the presence of parameters which are only defined under the alternative, so the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics is non-standard. simulation methods to calculate asymptotic and bootstrap distributions are presented. as the sampling distributions are quite sensitive to conditional heteroskedasticity in the error, careful modeling of the conditional variance is necessary for accurate inference on the conditional mean. we illustrate these methods with two applications--annual sunspot means and monthly u.s. industrial production. we find that annual sunspots and monthly industrial production are setar(2) processes. copyright 1999 by blackwell publishers ltd
somatic embryogenesis from ovaries of sweet orange cv. tobias an improvement of the protocol for haploid induction through anther culture of citrus clementina hort. ex tan. cv. nules was achieved following the evaluation of a number of the factors affecting androgenesis. the influence of thidiazuron (tdz) and three temperature pre-treatments (4°c, 25°c, 32°c) on the floral buds with respect to anther culture of c. clementina hort. ex tan., cv. nules was investigated. an increased embryoid production was induced in the medium supplemented with tdz. pre-treatment temperatures of 4°c and 25°c were more favorable for embryo production than 32°c. regeneration of androgenic haploid plantlets from cv. sra 63 of c. clementina is reported here for the first time.
importance of mangrove carbon for aquatic food webs in wet–dry tropical estuaries background stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology. key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. methodology by accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. conclusions we outline a framework that builds on recently published bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source r package, siar. the formulation in r will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.

control of vertebrate core planar cell polarity protein localization and dynamics by prickle 2 planar polarity decisions in the wing of drosophila involve the assembly of asymmetric protein complexes containing the conserved receptor frizzled. in this study, we analyse the role of the van gogh/strabismus gene in the formation of these complexes and cell polarisation. we find that the strabismus protein becomes asymmetrically localised to the proximal edge of cells. in the absence of strabismus activity, the planar polarity proteins dishevelled and prickle are mislocalised in the cell. we show that strabismus binds directly to dishevelled and prickle and is able to recruit them to membranes. furthermore, we demonstrate that the putative pdz-binding motif at the c terminus of strabismus is not required for its function. we propose a two-step model for assembly of frizzledcontaining asymmetric protein complexes at cell boundaries. first, strabismus acts together with frizzled and the atypical cadherin flamingo to mediate apicolateral recruitment of planar polarity proteins including dishevelled and prickle. in the second phase, dishevelled and prickle are required for these proteins to become asymmetrically distributed on the proximodistal axis.
tests for the assessment of sport-specific performance in olympic combat sports: a systematic review with practical recommendations performance testing is one of the most common and important measures used in sports science and physiology. performance tests allow for a controlled simulation of sports and exercise performance for research or applied science purposes. there are three factors that contribute to a good performance test: (i) validity; (ii) reliability; and (iii) sensitivity. a valid protocol is one that resembles the performance that is being simulated as closely as possible. when investigating race-type events, the two most common protocols are time to exhaustion and time trials. time trials have greater validity than time to exhaustion because they provide a good physiological simulation of actual performance and correlate with actual performance. sports such as soccer are more difficult to simulate. while shuttle-running protocols such as the loughborough intermittent shuttle test may simulate physiology of soccer using time to exhaustion or distance covered, it is not a valid measure of soccer performance. there is a need to include measures of skill in such protocols. reliability is the variation of a protocol. research has shown that time-to-exhaustion protocols have a coefficient of variation (cv) of >10%, whereas time trials are more reliable as they have been shown to have a cv of <5%. a sensitive protocol is one that is able to detect small, but important, changes in performance. the difference between finishing first and second in a sporting event is <1%. therefore, it is important to be able to detect small changes with performance protocols. a quantitative value of sensitivity may be accomplished through the signal : noise ratio, where the signal is the percentage improvement in performance and the noise is the cv.
methodological aspects of cognitive rehabilitation with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) the effects of saccadic bilateral (horizontal) eye movements on memory for a visual event narrative were investigated. in the study phase, participants were exposed to a set of pictures accompanied by a verbal commentary describing the events depicted in the pictures. next, the participants were asked either misleading or control questions about the depicted event and were then asked to engage in 30s of bilateral vs. vertical vs. no eye movements. finally, recognition memory was tested using the remember-know procedure. it was found that bilateral eye movements increased true memory for the event, increased recollection, and decreased the magnitude of the misinformation effect. the findings are discussed in terms of source monitoring, dual-process theories of memory and the potential neural foundations of such effects.
on the distribution of edges in random regular graphs we prove that for every constant δ>0 the chromatic number of the random graphg(n, p) withp=n−1/2−δ is asymptotically almost surely concentrated in two consecutive values. this implies that for any β<1/2 and any integer valued functionr(n)≤o(nβ) there exists a functionp(n) such that the chromatic number ofg(n,p(n)) is preciselyr(n) asymptotically almost surely.
exclusionary interactions among diverse fungi infecting developing seeds of centaurea stoebe. fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
bhlhb2 controls bdnf promoter 4 activity and neuronal excitability drugs of abuse cause activation of the cyclic amp response element binding protein (creb) in the nucleus accumbens (nac). expression of active creb in rat nac medium spiny neurons (msns) increased their excitability, whereas dominant-negative creb had the opposite effect. decreasing excitability of nac msns in vivo by overexpression of potassium channels enhanced locomotor responses to cocaine, suggesting that the increased nac msn excitability caused by creb helped to limit behavioral sensitivity to cocaine.
descriptive study of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza during five epidemic seasons (2010–2015) background the global burden of disease attributable to seasonal influenza virus in children is unknown. we aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from lower respiratory infections associated with influenza in children younger than 5 years.   methods we estimated the incidence of influenza episodes, influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infections (alri), and influenza-associated severe alri in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, with data from a systematic review of studies published between jan 1, 1995, and oct 31, 2010, and 16 unpublished population-based studies. we applied these incidence estimates to global population estimates for 2008 to calculate estimates for that year. we estimated possible bounds for influenza-associated alri mortality by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based reports and identifying studies with population-based data for influenza seasonality and monthly alri mortality.   findings we identified 43 suitable studies, with data for around 8 million children. we estimated that, in 2008, 90 million (95% ci 49-162 million) new cases of influenza (data from nine studies), 20 million (13-32 million) cases of influenza-associated alri (13% of all cases of paediatric alri; data from six studies), and 1 million (1-2 million) cases of influenza-associated severe alri (7% of cases of all severe paediatric alri; data from 39 studies) occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years. we estimated there were 28,000-111,500 deaths in children younger than 5 years attributable to influenza-associated alri in 2008, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any one setting.   interpretation influenza is a common pathogen identified in children with alri and results in a substantial burden on health services worldwide. sufficient data to precisely estimate the role of influenza in childhood mortality from alri are not available.   funding who; bill & melinda gates foundation.
testing common habitat-based surrogates of invertebrate diversity in a semi-arid rangeland a procedure for the implementation of quality control for laboratorysorting and identification of invertebrate specimens collected in biodiversityresearch is described. the procedure is based on process control sampling, aconcept of statistical process control (spc) used widely in the manufacturingand information technology industries, and adapted to suit the tasks andproducts of biodiversity sorting procedures. the major advantages of processcontrol over other quality control mechanisms are that it is more stringent, andcontinuous. hence, errors are detected and corrected as they occur, avoidingproliferation in the data set. the procedure is also highly interactive,offering the technicians the opportunity to learn as they work. protocols havebeen developed while sorting material collected as part of a study into theimpacts associated with invasion of a habitat (coastal heath) by an exotic weed(bitou bush – chrysanthemoides monilifera) on thecentral coast of new south wales, australia. major findings from the analysis ofmaterial processed include: that errors may have a variety of causes andsubsequent implications for data quality, levels of identification errors can besignificant even at higher taxonomic levels (e.g. sorting insects to order),initial training periods on their own are insufficient to ensure errorminimisation, and even with stringent protocols the ratio of technician tospecialist effort can be maintained at a level of around 5:1. the need forincorporating effective quality control procedures into invertebratebiodiversity data compilations is emphasised.
drivers with parkinson’s disease: are the symptoms of pd associated with restricted driving practices? cognitive impairment is common in parkinson's disease (pd) and can occur early in the disease course. no effective screening test exists for detection of early or mild cognitive impairment in pd. we examined the montreal cognitive assessment (moca) as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in pd. the test–retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.79 and the interrater intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81. the correlation coefficient between the moca and a neuropsychologic battery was 0.72. the moca is reliable and valid in the pd population and warrants further study as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction. © 2008 movement disorder society
projecting global marine biodiversity impacts under climate change scenarios global climate change is recognized as an important determining factor for the future distributions of marine organisms, notably fishes and invertebrates. shifting of distribution range may affect global marine fisheries and have large socio-economic implications. however, globalscale evaluation of the impact of climate change on marine species is lacking. in this paper, we develop a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict the effect of climate change on the distributions of marine species with emphasis on commercially exploited fishes and invertebrates. first, the model infers, for various species, bioclimate envelopes based on their current distribution. bioclimate envelopes are defined by sea water temperature, bathymetry, habitats and distance from sea ice. secondly, the model predicts the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes induced by changes in climate variables. simultaneously, following the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes, the model simulates movement of relative abundance through changes in population growth, mortality, larval dispersal and adult movement. we test the model with several commercially exploited fish species with widely different biogeography. the model provides reasonable and robust predictions of future distribution ranges of the four species under different scenarios of sea water warming. moreover, the predictions are robust to major model assumptions and parameter uncertainty. using realistic climate change predictions from the noaa/gfdl coupled model, this model will be used to evaluate impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries. introduction there is ample evidence from empirical observations and climate models indicating that mean global temperatures have been increasing over the last 100 years (ipcc 2007). global temperature has increased by over 0.6 oc since 1900 and it may continue to increase at a rate of around 0.2 oc per decade (ipcc 2007). biological responses to this change have been observed in both terrestrial and marine biomes (murawski 1993; hughes 2000; mccarty 2001; parmesan & yohe 2003; perry et al. 2005; hobday et al. 2006). the responses include changes in physiology (e.g. productivity), geographic range and phenology at population, species, community and ecosystem levels (hughes 2000; mccarty 2001). for instance, nearly two-thirds of marine fishes in the north sea shifted in mean latitude or depth or both over 25 years as sea temperature increased (perry et al. 2005). during the last century, annual growth rates for the juveniles of eight long-lived fish species in the southwest pacific increased in shallow waters and decreased in deep waters where ocean warming and cooling occurred, respectively (thresher et al 2007). this agrees with the quantitative model of fish physiology, which predicts increasing growth performance and fecundity in higher latitude and the converse in lower latitude as sea 1 cited as: cheung, w.w.l., lam, v.w.y., pauly, d. 2008. dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict climate-induced changes in distribution of marine fishes and invertebrates, p. 5-50. in: cheung, w.w.l, lam, v.w.y., pauly, d.

gtfold: enabling parallel rna secondary structure prediction on multi-core desktops a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of rna secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. to demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5s rrna in both escherichia coli and candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. the percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3% to 86.8% for the e. coli sequence by using modification constraints. for c. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5% both with and without modification data. on average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67% to 76%. this enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. for these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28% to 78%. for the 11 sequences with <6% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84% of known canonical base pairs.
regulatory sequences of orthologous petd chloroplast mrnas are highly specific among chlamydomonas species in the green unicellular alga chlamydomonas eugametos, cellular division is readily synchronized by light/dark cycles. under these conditions, light initiates photosynthetic growth in daughter cells and begins the g1 phase. genes whose expression is regulated upon illumination are likely to be important mechanisms controlling cell proliferation. to identify some of those genes, two cdna libraries were prepared with poly(a)+ extracted from cells either stimulated with light for 1 h or held in darkness (quiescent cells) during the same period. to restrict our analysis to those genes that are part of the primary response, cells were incubated in presence of cycloheximide. differential screening of approximately 40 000 clones in each library revealed 44 clones which hybridize preferentially with a [32p] cdna probe derived from rna of light-stimulated cells and 15 clones which react selectively with a [32p] cdna probe synthesized from poly(a)+ rna of quiescent cells. cross-hybridization of these clones identified 4 independent sequences in the light-induced (li) collection and 2 in the uninduced (lr) library. four of these cdnas correspond to mrnas that are positively or negatively regulated upon activation of photosynthesis. one clone represents a mrna that accumulates transitorily at both transitions. finally, li818 cdna identifies a new chlorophyll a/b-binding (cab) gene family whose mrna accumulation is controlled by light and a circadian oscillator. the endogenous timing system controls li818 mrna accumulation so that it precedes the onset of illumination by a few hours. on the other hand, light affects li818 mrna levels independently of active photosynthesis.
gper: a new tool to protect dopaminergic neurons? parkinson’s disease (pd) is characterised by the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurones from the substantia nigra (sn) that leads to the hallmark motor disturbances. animal and human studies suggest a beneficial effect of oestrogen to the nigrostriatal system, and the regulation of neurotrophic factor expression by oestrogens has been suggested as a possible mechanism contributing to that neuroprotective effect. the present study was designed to investigate whether the neuroprotection exerted by 17β‐oestradiol on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones is mediated through the regulation of glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) expression. using an in vivo rat model of pd, we were able to confirm the relevance of 17β‐oestradiol in defending dopaminergic neurones against 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐ohda) toxicity. 17β‐oestradiol, released by micro‐osmotic pumps, implanted 10 days before intrastriatal 6‐ohda injection, prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurones induced by 6‐ohda. 17β‐oestradiol treatment also promoted an increase in gdnf protein levels both in the sn and striatum. to explore the relevance of gdnf increases to 17β‐oestradiol neuroprotection, we analysed, in sn neurone‐glia cultures, the effect of gdnf antibody neutralisation and rna interference‐mediated gdnf knockdown. the results showed that both gdnf neutralisation and gdnf silencing abolished the dopaminergic protection provided by 17β‐oestradiol against 6‐ohda toxicity. taken together, these results strongly identify gdnf as an important player in 17β‐oestradiol‐mediated dopaminergic neuroprotection.
functional abnormalities of heparan sulfate in mucopolysaccharidosis-i are associated with defective biologic activity of fgf-2 on human multipotent progenitor cells. stem cell localization, conservation, and differentiation is believed to occur in niches in the marrow stromal microenvironment. our recent observation that long-term in vitro human hematopoiesis requires a stromal heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hspg) led us to hypothesize that such hspg may orchestrate the formation of the stem cell niche. we compared the structure and function of hs from m2-10b4, a hematopoiesis-supportive cell line, with hs from a nonsupportive cell line, fhs-173-we. long-term culture-initiating cell (ltc-ic) maintenance was enhanced by pg from supportive cells but not by pg from nonsupportive cells (p <.005). the supportive hs were significantly larger and more highly sulfated than the nonsupportive hs. specifically, supportive hs contained higher 6-o-sulfation on the glucosamine residues. in agreement with these observations, purified 6-o-sulfated heparin and highly 6-o-sulfated bovine kidney hs similarly maintained ltc-ic. in contrast, completely desulfated heparin, n-sulfated heparin, and unmodified heparin did not support ltc-ic maintenance. moreover, the supportive hs promoted ltc-ic maintenance but not differentiation of cd34(+)/hla-dr- cells into colony-forming cells (cfcs) and mature blood cells. the supportive hs but not the nonsupportive hs bound both cytokines and matrix components critical for hematopoiesis, including interleukin-3 (il-3), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (mip-1), and thrombospondin (tsp). significantly more cd34(+) cells adhered directly to immobilized o-sulfated heparin than to n-sulfated or desulfated heparin. thus, hematopoiesis-supportive stromal hspg possessing large, highly 6-o-sulfated hs mediate the juxtaposition of hematopoietic progenitors with stromal cells, specific growth-promoting (il-3) and growth-inhibitory (mip-1 and platelet factor 4 [pf4]) cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins such as tsp. we conclude that the structural specificity of stromal hspg that determines the selective colocalization of cytokines and ecm components leads to the formation of discrete niches, thereby orchestrating the controlled growth and differentiation of stem cells. these findings may have important implications for ex vivo expansion of and gene transfer into primitive hematopoietic progenitors.
optical characterization of two-layered turbid media for non-invasive, absolute oximetry in cerebral and extracerebral tissue we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
fate of the 63-kda periplasmic protein of the infectious form of the endonuclear symbiotic bacterium holospora obtusa during the infection process. the symbiotic bacterium holospora obtusa infects the macronucleus of the ciliate paramecium caudatum. after ingestion by its host, an infectious form of holospora with an electron-translucent tip passes through the host digestive vacuole and penetrates the macronuclear envelope with this tip. to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of this process, we raised a monoclonal antibody against the tip-specific 89-kda protein, sequenced this partially, and identified the corresponding complete gene. the deduced protein sequence carries two actin-binding motifs. indirect immunofluorescence microscopy shows that during escape from the host digestive vacuole, the 89-kda proteins translocates from the inside to the outside of the tip. when the bacterium invades the macronucleus, the 89-kda protein is left behind at the entry point of the nuclear envelope. transmission electron microscopy shows the formation of fine fibrous structures that co-localize with the antibody-labeled regions of the bacterium. our findings suggest that the 89-kda protein plays a role in holospora's escape from the host digestive vacuole, the migration through the host cytoplasm, and the invasion into the macronucleus.
omnigraph: rich representation and graph kernel learning after presenting a novel o(n3) parsing algorithm for dependency grammar, we develop three contrasting ways to stochasticize it. we propose (a) a lexical affinity model where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words fluctuate randomly in their selectional preferences, and (c) a generative model where the speaker fleshes out each word's syntactic and conceptual structure without regard to the implications for the hearer. we also give preliminary empirical results from evaluating the three models' parsing performance on annotated wall street journal training text (derived from the penn treebank). in these results, the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equally well at assigning part-of-speech tags.
a de and pso based hybrid algorithm for dynamic optimization problems evolutionary algorithms (eas) are widely used to deal with optimization problems in dynamic environments (de) [3]. when using eas to solve de problems, we are usually interested in the algorithm's ability to adapt and recover from the changes. one of the main problems facing an evolutionary method when solving de problems is the loss of genetic diversity.in this paper, we investigate the use of evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods (emos) for single-objective de problems. for that purpose, we introduce an artificial second objective with the aim to maintain useful diversity in the population. six different artificial objectives are examined and compared.all the results will be compared against a traditional ga and the random immigrants algorithm[4]. nsga2 is employed as the evolutionary multi-objective technique.
standardization and km : evaluating knowledge quality if research is like a football game, then the first thing new players can expect to do is to learn some of the rules of the game and then to become skilled in playing the game according to these rules. a well-defined set of rules is a great advantage to novices and to seasoned players. in doing quantitative research, the rules are clear. to researchers trained in these methods, it may therefore come as a surprise to find that there exists a variation of the research game in which there are no fixed rules but only general principles. the position of the goal posts, for example, may be different for different games and may even be moved in the course of a game. some novices may see this as presenting the opportunity for a glorious free-for-all, releasing them from the constraints of the quantitative research game. in the midst of their new-found freedom, they may then find themselves accosted by experienced players who seem to have, after all, a definite set of rules. on being challenged, experienced players may then explain that, while there are only general principles, these are interpreted in a quite specific way depending on the particular context within which the game is being played. 'context' becomes the bugbear for the novice. the novice may even have to learn that, before booting the ball through the goal posts, the player has to take account of where the ball is coming from, where it wants to go and what meaning it, the ball, attaches to the experience of being kicked! freedom readily gives way to frustration and incomprehension. happily, there are some brave researchers who set about the task of making the rules of qualitative research explicit to novices and to experienced players. the three books reviewed here fall into that category. they all take on a different task. the collection of articles brought together in one edition by janice morse is not about the rules but about some exciting games that have been played. together the articles demonstrate not only the pleasures of the qualitative research game, but also its contribution to a fine, detailed understanding of important health prob-
genome-wide identification and characterization of a dehydrin gene family in poplar (populus trichocarpa) the algorithm described in this paper discovers one or more motifs in a collection of dna or protein sequences by using the technique of expectation maximization to fit a two-component finite mixture model to the set of sequences. multiple motifs are found by fitting a mixture model to the data, probabilistically erasing the occurrences of the motif thus found, and repeating the process to find successive motifs. the algorithm requires only a set of unaligned sequences and a number specifying the width of the motifs as input. it returns a model of each motif and a threshold which together can be used as a bayes-optimal classifier for searching for occurrences of the motif in other databases. the algorithm estimates how many times each motif occurs in each sequence in the dataset and outputs an alignment of the occurrences of the motif. the algorithm is capable of discovering several different motifs with differing numbers of occurrences in a single dataset.
a multi-kernel framework for inductive semi-supervised learning multiple kernel learning aims at simultaneously learning a kernel and the associated predictor in supervised learning settings. for the support vector machine, an efficient and general multiple kernel learning (mkl) algorithm, based on semi-infinite linear progamming, has been recently proposed. this approach has opened new perspectives since it makes the mkl approach tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. however, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. in this paper, we address the mkl problem through an adaptive 2-norm regularization formulation that encourages sparse kernel combinations. apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard svm optimization problem, where the kernel is defined as a linear combination of multiple kernels. we propose an algorithm, named simplemkl, for solving this mkl problem and provide a new insight on mkl algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. furthermore, we show how simplemkl can be applied beyond binary classification, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classification) or multiclass classification. experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and that its efficiency compares favorably to other mkl algorithms. finally, we illustrate the usefulness of mkl for some regressors based on wavelet kernels and on some model selection problems related to multiclass classification problems. a simplemkl toolbox is available at http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakotom/code/mklindex.html 1 ha l-0 02 18 33 8, v er si on 1 26 j an 2 00 8
evaluating molecular mechanical potentials for helical peptides and proteins we study atomic models of the thermodynamics of the structural transition of peptides that form α-helices. the effect of sequence variation on α-helix formation for alanine-rich peptides, ac-ala21- methyl amide (a21) and ac-a5 (aaara)3a-methyl amide (fs peptide), is investigated by atomic simulation studies of the thermodynamics of the helix-coil transition in explicit water. the simulations show that the guanidinium group in the arg side chains in the fs peptide interacts with the carbonyl group four amino acids upstream in the chain and desolvates backbone hydrogen bonds. this desolvation can be directly correlated with a higher probability of hydrogen bond formation. we find that fs has higher helical content than a21 at all temperatures. a small modification in the amber force field reproduces the experimental helical content and helix-coil transition temperatures for the fs peptide.
photoinduced cu(ii)-mediated rdrp to p(vdf-co-ctfe)-g-pan an environmentally friendly and controllable p(vdf-co-ctfe) hydrogenation route involving the transition-metal complex mediated radical chain transfer reaction is successfully developed to synthesize p(vdf-co-ctfe-co-trfe). the typical transition metal catalysts of atrp reaction could be applied in this process.
a coupled deformable model for tracking myocardial borders from real-time echocardiography using an incompressibility constraint this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
online convolutional sparse coding with sample-dependent dictionary in recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. recent activity in this field concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a pre-specified set of linear transforms, or by adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. both these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. in this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. we present a new method – the k-svd algorithm – generalizing the k-means clustering process. k-svd is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary, and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. the update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. the k-svd algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, focuss, or matching pursuit). we analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results on both synthetic tests and in applications on real image data.
real life experience with alemtuzumab treatment of patients with lower-risk mds and a hypocellular bone marrow immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to induce sustained hematological responses in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (mds). in particular, antithymocyte globulin (atg), a polyclonal immunoglobulin induces hematological responses in up to 60% of mds patients. we report herein on the results of a retrospective multicenter study on the use of atg in the treatment of 96 patients with mds. patients were evaluated for duration of response to atg, as well as survival after administration of atg. the median age of the cohort was 54.7 years (range: 19–75 years), with a median follow-up of 33.8 months (range: 0.8–133 months). a total of 40 patients (42%) achieved a hematological response, of which 30 patients (75%) had a durable hematological response lasting a median duration of 31.5 months (range: 6–92 months). on multivariate analysis, both low international prognostic scoring system (ipss) and bone marrow (bm) hypocellularity were independent predictive factors for improved response to atg (ipss int-2/high: odds ratio (or) 0.08, p=0.018 and bm normo/hypercellularity: or 0.49, p=0.012). in addition, ipss was the sole predictor of overall survival, with int-2/high risk patients having a significantly poorer survival outcome (or 0.08, p<0.01). in conclusion, this study identifies bm hypocellularity and a low ipss as important factors predicting response to atg.
multiple rrna operons are essential for efficient cell growth and sporulation as well as outgrowth in bacillus subtilis. rna was extracted from dormant and germinating bacillus subtilis 168 spores (intact spores and chemically decoated spores) by using rapid rupture followed by acid–phenol extraction. spore germination progress was monitored by assaying colony forming ability before and after heat shock and by reading the optical density at 600 nm. the purity, yield, and composition of the extracted rna were determined spectrophotometrically from the ratio of absorption at 260 nm to that at 280 nm; in a 2100 bioanalyzer, giving the rna yield/108 spores or cells and the distribution pattern of rrna components. the method reported here for the extraction of rna from dormant spores, as well as during different phases of germination and outgrowth, has proven to be fast, efficient and simple to handle. rna of a high purity was obtained from dormant spores and during all phases of germination and growth. there was a significant increase in rna yield during the transition from dormant spores to germination and subsequent outgrowth. chemically decoated spores were retarded in germination and outgrowth compared with intact spores, and less rna was extracted; however, the differences were not significant. this method for rna isolation of dormant, germinating, and outgrowing bacterial endospores is a valuable prerequisite for gene expression studies, especially in studies on the responses of spores to hostile environmental conditions.
adaptive clustering for coreference resolution with deterministic rules and web-based language models most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
compression of deep neural networks for image instance retrieval evidence is mounting that convnets are the best representation learning method for recognition. in the common scenario, a convnet is trained on a large labeled dataset and the feed-forward units activation, at a certain layer of the network, is used as a generic representation of an input image. recent studies have shown this form of representation to be astoundingly effective for a wide range of recognition tasks. this paper thoroughly investigates the transferability of such representations w.r.t. several factors. it includes parameters for training the network such as its architecture and parameters of feature extraction. we further show that different visual recognition tasks can be categorically ordered based on their distance from the source task. we then show interesting results indicating a clear correlation between the performance of tasks and their distance from the source task conditioned on proposed factors. furthermore, by optimizing these factors, we achieve state-of-the-art performances on 16 visual recognition tasks.
a simple hierarchical pooling data structure for loop closure this paper presents a mathematical definition of the "probability-weighted amount of information" (pwi), a measure of specificity of terms in documents that is based on an information-theoretic view of retrieval events. the proposed pwi is expressed as a product of the occurrence probabilities of terms and their amounts of information, and corresponds well with the conventional term frequency-inverse document frequency measures that are commonly used in today's information retrieval systems. the mathematical definition of the pwi is shown, together with some illustrative examples of the calculation.
mining bucket order-preserving submatrices in gene expression data subspace clustering has attracted great attention due to its capability of finding salient patterns in high dimensional data. order preserving subspace clusters have been proven to be important in high throughput gene expression analysis, since functionally related genes are often co-expressed under a set of experimental conditions. such co-expression patterns can be represented by consistent orderings of attributes. existing order preserving cluster models require all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order without deviation. however, real data are noisy due to measurement technology limitation and experimental variability which prohibits these strict models from revealing true clusters corrupted by noise. in this paper, we study the problem of revealing the order preserving clusters in the presence of noise. we propose a noise-tolerant model called approximate order preserving cluster (aopc). instead of requiring all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order, we require that (1) at least a certain fraction of the objects have identical attribute order; (2) other objects in the cluster may deviate from the consensus order by up to a certain fraction of attributes. we also propose an algorithm to mine aopc. experiments on gene expression data demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm.
arachidonic acid-induced apoptosis in rat hepatoma as-30d cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species. arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
intestinal stem cells in gi physiology and disease comparison of effects of a selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor versus a 5-ht 4 receptor agonist on in vivo neurogenesis at the rectal anastomosis in rats moderate rectal distension elicits recto-rectal reflex contractions and simultaneous recto-internal anal sphincter reflex relaxations that together comprise the defecation reflex. both reflexes are controlled by 1) pelvic nerves, 2) lumbar colonic nerves, and 3) enteric nervous system. the aim of the present study was to explore a novel approach to repairing the defecation reflex dysfunction by using the plasticity of enteric nervous pathways. experiments were performed in anesthetized guinea pigs with ethyl carbamate. the rectum 30 mm oral from the anal verge was transected without damage to extrinsic nerves, and subsequent end-to-end one-layer anastomosis was performed. recovery of the defecation reflex and associated reflex pathways were evaluated. eight weeks after sectioning of intrinsic reflex nerve pathways in the rectum, the defecation reflex recovered to the control level, accompanied with regeneration of reflex pathways. the 5-ht(4)-receptor agonist mosapride (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the recovered defecation reflex 8 wk after surgery. two weeks after local treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf: 10(-6) g/ml) at the rectal anastomotic site, the recto-internal anal sphincter reflex relaxations recovered and some bundles of fine nerve fibers were shown to interconnect the oral and anal ends of the myenteric plexus. these results suggested a possibility for repairing the anal dysfunction by promoting regeneration of the reflex pathways in the enteric nervous system with local application of bdnf.
weakly supervised 3d reconstruction with adversarial constraint inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve robust 3d reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture that we call the 3d recurrent reconstruction neural network (3d-r2n2). the network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3d shapes from a large collection of synthetic data [13]. our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3d occupancy grid. unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and (ii) enables the 3d reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional sfm/slam methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).
dendritic cell-based immunotherapy. immunotherapies for human autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases are proliferating rapidly, and with these changes comes the opportunity to monitor patients for immune responses to therapy based on early surrogate markers for clinical responses. class ii tetramers have the potential to serve as these sorts of markers for immune monitoring, and thereby assist with patient management, therapy selection, and improved outcomes. however, important issues of tcr avidity require resolution, because much is still unknown regarding location, quantitation, and characterization of the human t cell response. opportunities for application of tetramer technologies in the near future will enable both clinical progress and the development of new insights into human cd4+ t cell biology in vivo.
establishing a professional profile of community health workers: results from a national study of roles, activities and training the community health worker model is recognized nationally as a means to address glaring inequities in the burden of adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups in the united states. this study explored arizona chw involvement in advocacy beyond the individual patient level into the realm of advocating for community level change as a mechanism to reduce the structural underpinnings of health disparities. a survey of chws in arizona found that chws advocate at local, state and federal political levels as well as within health and social service agencies and business. characteristics significantly associated with advocacy include employment in a not for profit organization, previous leadership training, and a work environment that allows flexible work hours and the autonomy to start new projects at work. intrinsic characteristics of chws associated with advocacy include their belief that they can influence community decisions, self perception that they are leaders in the community, and knowledge of who to talk to in their community to make change. community-level advocacy has been identified as a core chw function and has the potential to address structural issues such as poverty, employment, housing, and discrimination. agencies utilizing the chw model could encourage community advocacy by providing a flexible working environment, ongoing leadership training, and opportunities to collaborate with both veteran chws and local community leaders. further research is needed to understand the nature and impact of chw community advocacy activities on both systems change and health outcomes.
after sandy hook elementary: a year in the gun control debate on twitter this paper describes our approach for the detecting stance in tweets task (semeval-2016 task 6). we utilized recent advances in short text categorization using deep learning to create word-level and character-level models. the choice between word-level and character-level models in each particular case was informed through validation performance. our final system is a combination of classifiers using word-level or character-level models. we also employed novel data augmentation techniques to expand and diversify our training dataset, thus making our system more robust. our system achieved a macro-average precision, recall and f1-scores of 0.67, 0.61 and 0.635 respectively.
direct and indirect determinants of the patient global assessment in rheumatoid arthritis: differences by level of disease activity a structure for representation of patient outcome is presented, together with a method for outcome measurement and validation of the technique in rheumatoid arthritis. the paradigm represents outcome by five separate dimensions: death, discomfort, disability, drug (therapeutic) toxicity, and dollar cost. each dimension represents an outcome directly related to patient welfare. quantitation of these outcome dimensions may be performed at interview or by patient questionnaire. with standardized, validated questions, similar scores are achieved by both methods. the questionnaire technique is preferred since it is inexpensive and does not require interobserver validation. these techniques appear extremely useful for evaluation of long term outcome of patients with rheumatic diseases.

a multi-component prime-boost vaccination regimen with a consensus momp antigen enhances chlamydia trachomatis clearance the majority of vaccine candidates in clinical development are highly purified proteins and peptides relying on adjuvants to enhance and/or direct immune responses. despite the acknowledged need for novel adjuvants, there are still very few adjuvants in licensed human vaccines. a vast number of adjuvants have been tested pre-clinically using different experimental conditions, rendering it impossible to directly compare their activity. we performed a head-to-head comparison of five different adjuvants alum, mf59®, gla-se, ic31® and caf01 in mice and combined these with antigens from m. tuberculosis, influenza, and chlamydia to test immune-profiles and efficacy in infection models using standardized protocols. regardless of antigen, each adjuvant had a unique immunological signature suggesting that the adjuvants have potential for different disease targets. alum increased antibody titers; mf59® induced strong antibody and il-5 responses; gla-se induced antibodies and th1; caf01 showed a mixed th1/th17 profile and ic31® induced strong th1 responses. mf59® and gla-se were strong inducers of influenza hi titers while caf01, gla-se and ic31® enhanced protection to tb and chlamydia. importantly, this is the first extensive attempt to categorize clinical-grade adjuvants based on their immune profiles and protective efficacy to inform a rational development of next generation vaccines for human use.
polo-like kinase-1 controls aurora a destruction by activating apc/c-cdh1 we show that human cdc14a phosphatase interacts with interphase centrosomes, and that this interaction is independent of microtubules and cdc14a phosphatase activity, but requires active nuclear export. disrupting the nuclear export signal (nes) led to cdc14a being localized in nucleoli, which in unperturbed cells selectively contain cdc14b (ref. 1). conditional overproduction of cdc14a, but not its phosphatase-dead or nes-deficient mutants, or cdc14b, resulted in premature centrosome splitting and formation of supernumerary mitotic spindles. in contrast, downregulation of endogenous cdc14a by short inhibitory rna duplexes (sirna) induced mitotic defects including impaired centrosome separation and failure to undergo productive cytokinesis. consequently, both overexpression and downregulation of cdc14a caused aberrant chromosome partitioning into daughter cells. these results indicate that cdc14a is a physiological regulator of the centrosome duplication cycle, which, when disrupted, can lead to genomic instability in mammalian cells.
the calcium channel blocker verapamil inhibits oxidative stress response in candida albicans abstract the ability of the major systemic fungal pathogen of humans, candida albicans, to sense and respond to reactive oxygen species (ros), such as h2o2 generated by the host immune system, is required for survival in the host. however, the intracellular signaling mechanisms underlying such responses are poorly understood. here, we show that thioredoxin (trx1), in addition to its antioxidant activity, plays a central role in coordinating the response of c. albicans to ros by regulating multiple pathways. in particular, trx1 function is important for h2o2-induced phosphorylation of the hog1 stress-activated protein kinase and to reverse h2o2-induced oxidation and activation of the ap-1 like transcription factor cap1. furthermore, trx1 regulates h2o2-induced hyperpolarized bud growth in a mechanism that involves activation of the rad53 checkpoint kinase. consistent with its key roles in responses to ros, cells lacking trx1 displayed significantly attenuated virulence in a murine model of c. albicans systemic infection. collectively, our data indicate that trx1 has a multifaceted role in h2o2 signaling and promotes c. albicans survival in the host.
an efficient mixed-mode bist technique a new design methodology for a pattern generator is proposed, formulated in the context of on-chip bist. the design methodology is circuit-specific and uses synthesis techniques to design bist generators. the pattern generator consists of two components: a pseudorandom pattern generator (like an lfsr or, preferably, a glfsr) and a combinational logic to map the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. this combinational logic is synthesized to produce a given set of target patterns by mapping the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. it is shown that, for a particular cut, an area-efficient combinational logic block can be designed/synthesized to achieve 100 (or almost 100) percent single stuck-at fault coverage using a small number of test the this method is significantly different from weighted pattern generation and can guarantee testing of all hard-to-detect faults without expensive test point insertion. experimental results on common benchmark netlists demonstrate that the fault coverage of the proposed pattern generator is significantly higher compared to conventional pattern generation techniques. the design technique for the logic mapper is unique and can be used effectively to improve existing pattern generators for combinational logic and scan-based bist structures.
results of osteochondral autologous transplantation in the knee purpose the purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of mosaic-type osteochondral autologous transplantation (oat) and microfracture (mf) procedures for the treatment of the articular cartilage defects of the knee joint in young active athletes.   type of study prospective randomized clinical study.   methods between 1998 and 2002, a total of 60 athletes with a mean age of 24.3 years (range, 15 to 40 years) and with a symptomatic lesion of the articular cartilage in the knee were randomized to undergo either an oat or an mf procedure. only those athletes playing in competitive sports at regional or national levels were included in the study. fifty-seven athletes (95%) were available for a follow-up. there were 28 athletes in the oat group and 29 athletes in the mf group. the mean duration of symptoms was 21.32 +/- 5.57 months and the mean follow-up was 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months), and none of the athletes had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. patients were evaluated using modified hospital for special surgery (hss) and international cartilage repair society (icrs) scores, radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (mri), and clinical assessment. an independent observer performed a follow-up examination after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. at 12.4 months postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histologic evaluation was carried out. a radiologist and a pathologist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment, did the radiologic and histologic evaluations.   results after 37.1 months, both groups had significant clinical improvement (p < .05). according to the modified hss and icrs scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after oat compared with 52% for the mf procedure (p < .001). at 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery, the hss and icrs showed statistically significantly better results in the oat group (p = .03; p = .006; p = .006). younger athletes did better in both groups. no serious complications were reported. there was 1 failure in the oat group and 9 in the mf group. the icrs cartilage repair assessment for macroscopic evaluation during arthroscopy at 12.4 months showed excellent or good repairs in 84% after oat and in 57% after mf. biopsy specimens were obtained from 58% of the patients and histologic evaluation of repair showed better scores (according to icrs) for the oat group (p < .05). mri evaluation showed excellent or good repairs in 94% after oat compared with 49% after mf. twenty-six (93%) oat patients and 15 (52%) mf patients returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4 to 8 months). others showed a decline in sports activity level.   conclusions at an average of 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months) follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in young active athletes under the age of 40 has shown significant superiority of oat over mf for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. we found that only 52% of mf athletes could return to sports at the preinjury level. limitations of our study included a small number of athletes and a relatively short (3-year) follow-up. a long-term follow-up is needed to assess the durability of articular cartilage repair using these methods in young active athletes.   level of evidence level i, therapeutic study, randomized controlled trial, significant difference (a).
the application of spatio-temporal feature and multi-sensor in home medical devices the aim of this paper is to address recognition of natural human actions in diverse and realistic video settings. this challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. we evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. we present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear svms. the method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard kth action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. we finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results.
impact of antiretroviral pressure on selection of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope sequences in vitro. it has been reported that the addition of a potential n-linked glycosylation site (pngs) to the gp120 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) envelope glycoprotein provides protection against neutralizing antibodies (nabs) by acting as a 'glycan shield'. in this study, we induced insertion of a pngs into the v2 region of hiv-1(bal) with the kd-247 anti-v3 neutralizing monoclonal antibody. in the presence of kd-247 (200 microg ml(-1)) at passage five, viruses with 3 aa mutations in the c2 (t240s and i283t) and v3 (t319a) regions expanded from pre-existing variants. after six passages with kd-247 (>300 microg ml(-1)), a pngs emerged in the v2 region in addition to c2 (t240s) and v3 mutations (r315k and f317l). a variant with a pngs insertion in v2, but no v3 mutations was sensitive to kd-247, whereas a clone with a v2 pngs insertion and mutations in v3 demonstrated a high level of resistance to kd-247. replication kinetic analysis revealed that the f317l mutation in v3 played a compensatory role for fitness-loss caused by the pngs insertion in v2. the evading hiv-1 variant did not revert back to the wild-type virus after 14 passages without kd-247. these findings demonstrate that the virus with fitness-loss mutations can replicate equally as well as the wild-type virus to acquire some key mutations in the v3 stem and the c2 region, and the compensated variants containing pngs do not revert back to the ancestral virus even in the absence of nab.
assessment of genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships based on ribosomal dna repeat unit length variation and internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences in chickpea (cicer arietinum) cultivars and its wild species molecular phylogeny based on internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences was studied to resolve the taxonomic contradiction in vigna and its relation to phaseolus. the its region of the 18s-26s nuclear ribosomal dna repeat was sequenced for 29 vigna species, selected from five of the nine subgenera, and 9 species of phaseolus. the length of its-1 ranged from 187 to 243 bp and 217 to 290 bp, and that of its-2 from 187 to 219 bp and 225 to 243 bp, within vigna and phaseolus species, respectively. phylogenies derived from its sequences based on maximum-parsimony and neighbor-joining methods gave trees essentially of similar topology. the its phylogeny was generally congruent with recent classifications based largely on morphological, biochemical, cytogenetical, and palynological features, except that subgenus plectotropis of neotropical origin was revealed to be closely related to subgenus vigna instead of forming a link between african (subgenus vigna) and asiatic (subgenus ceratotropis) vignas, and subgenus sigmoidotropis, featuring morphological characters of both vigna and phaseolus, was placed as the sister group to the phaseolus taxa. the its sequences were shown to be useful for identifying wild progenitors of v. mungo, v. radiata, v. umbellata, and v. unguiculata and for clarifying taxonomy-related problems in many previously controversial cases. this study also affirms that v. umbellata and v. angularis are the diploid progenitors of the only tetraploid species (v. glabrescens) known in the genus.
species diversity and functional assessment of macroinvertebrate communities in austrian rivers an exact expression is given for the jackknife estimate of the number of species in a community and for the variance of this number when quadrat sampling procedures are used. the jackknife estimate is a function of the number of species that occur in one and only one quadrat. the variance of the number of species can be constructed, as can approximate two-sided confidence intervals. the behavior of the jackknife estimate, as affected by quadrat size, sample size and sampling area, is investigated by simulation.
exclusionary interactions among diverse fungi infecting developing seeds of centaurea stoebe. fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
the addition of bicalutamide 150 mg to radiotherapy significantly improves overall survival in men with locally advanced prostate cancer to evaluate, in the ongoing early prostate cancer (epc) trial programme, the efficacy and tolerability of bicalutamide 150 mg once daily in addition to standard care for localized or locally advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
increased glutathione biosynthesis plays a role in nickel tolerance in thlaspi nickel hyperaccumulators copper tolerance among arabidopsis ecotypes is inversely correlated with long-term k(+) leakage and positively correlated with short-term k(+) leakage (a. murphy, l. taiz [1997] new phytol 136: 211-222). to probe the mechanism of the early phase of k(+) efflux, we tested various channel blockers on copper and peroxide-induced k(+) efflux from seedling roots. the k(+) channel blockers tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-aminopyridine (4-ap) both inhibited short-term copper-induced k(+) efflux. in contrast, peroxide-induced k(+) efflux was insensitive to both tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-ap. copper-induced lipid peroxidation exhibited a lag time of 4 h, while peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation began immediately. these results suggest that short-term copper-induced k(+) efflux is mediated by channels, while peroxide-induced k(+) efflux represents leakage through nonspecific lesions in the lipid bilayer. tracer studies with (86)rb(+) confirmed that copper promotes k(+) efflux rather than inhibiting k(+) uptake. short-term k(+) release is electroneutral, since electrophysiological measurements indicated that copper does not cause membrane depolarization. short-term k(+) efflux was accompanied by citrate release, and copper increased total citrate levels. since citrate efflux was blocked by 4-ap, k(+) appears to serve as a counterion during copper-induced citrate efflux. as copper but not aluminum selectively induces citrate production and release, it is proposed that copper may inhibit a cytosolic form of aconitase.
semi-supervised learning with committees: exploiting unlabeled data using ensemble learning algorithms this paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. this is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.we introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of expectation-maximization (em) and a naive bayes classifier. the algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. it then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. this basic em procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. however these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. we present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%.
weight optimization for discourse-level smt we collected a corpus of parallel text in 11 languages from the proceedings of the european parliament, which are published on the web1. this corpus has found widespread use in the nlp community. here, we focus on its acquisition and its application as training data for statistical machine translation (smt). we trained smt systems for 110 language pairs, which reveal interesting clues into the challenges ahead.
a search for snca 3′ utr variants identified snp rs356165 as a determinant of disease risk and onset age in parkinson’s disease few detailed clinico-pathological correlations of parkinson's disease have been published. the pathological findings in 100 patients diagnosed prospectively by a group of consultant neurologists as having idiopathic parkinson's disease are reported. seventy six had nigral lewy bodies, and in all of these lewy bodies were also found in the cerebral cortex. in 24 cases without lewy bodies, diagnoses included progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, alzheimer's disease, alzheimer-type pathology, and basal ganglia vascular disease. the retrospective application of recommended diagnostic criteria improved the diagnostic accuracy to 82%. these observations call into question current concepts of parkinson's disease as a single distinct morbid entity.
identification of human ikk-2 inhibitors of natural origin (part i): modeling of the ikk-2 kinase domain, virtual screening and activity assays we have recently identified bms-345541 (1) as a highly selective and potent inhibitor of ikk-2 (ic50 = 0.30 microm), which however was considerably less potent against ikk-1 (ic50 = 4.0 microm). in order to further explore the sar around the imidazoquinoxaline tricyclic structure of 1, we prepared a series of tetracyclic analogues (7, 13, and 18). the synthesis and biological activities of these potent ikk inhibitors are described.
handwritten characters recognition based on nature-inspired computing and neuro-evolution in this paper, we analyze the performance of a classifier ensemble consisting of small-sized neural networks for accurate and fast learning. to this end, three topologies of neural networks are evaluated: the multilayer perceptron with two different configurations in the hidden layer, and the modular neural network. the experiments here carried out illustrate the effectiveness of the ensembles of neural networks in terms of average predictive accuracy and processing time, as compared to the single classifiers.
growth inhibition of escherichia coli by dichloromethane in cells expressing dichloromethane dehalogenase/glutathione s-transferase. abstract the kinetic properties of bacterial and rat liver glutathione s-transferases (gst) active with dichloromethane (dcm) were compared. the theta class glutathione s-transferase (rgstt1-1) from rat liver had an affinity for dihalomethanes lower by three orders of magnitude (kapp > 50 mm) than the bacterial dcm dehalogenase/gst from methylophilus sp. dm11. unlike the bacterial dcm dehalogenase, the rat enzyme was unable to support growth of the dehalogenase minus methylobacterium sp. dm4-2cr mutant with dcm. moreover, the presence of dcm inhibited growth with methanol of the dm4-2cr transconjugant expressing the rat liver gstt1-1. in salmonella typhimurium ta1535, expression of rat and bacterial dcm-active gst from a plasmid in the presence of dcm yielded up to 5.3 times more reversions to histidine prototrophy in the transconjugant expressing the rat enzyme. under the same conditions, however, gst-mediated conversion of dcm to formaldehyde was lower in cell-free extracts of the transconjugant expressing the rat gstt1 than in the corresponding strain expressing the bacterial dcm dehalogenase. this provided new evidence that formaldehyde was not the main toxicant associated with gst-mediated dcm conversion, and indicated that an intermediate in the transformation of dcm by gst, presumably s-chloromethylglutathione, was responsible for the observed effects. the marked differences in substrate affinity of rat and bacterial dcm-active gst, as well as in the toxicity and genotoxicity associated with expression of these enzymes in bacteria, suggest that bacterial dcm dehalogenases/gst have evolved to minimise the toxic effects associated with glutathione-mediated catalysis of dcm conversion.
biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass. abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
a topic-based reordering model for statistical machine translation statistical machine translation systems are usually trained on a large amount of bilingual sentence pairs and translate one sentence at a time, ignoring document-level information. in this paper, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level translation. since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size. in this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side. in particular, three new features are designed to explore various kinds of document-level information in above three kinds of caches. evaluation shows the effectiveness of our cache-based approach to document-level translation with the performance improvement of 0.81 in blue score over moses. especially, detailed analysis and discussion are presented to give new insights to document-level translation.
quantitative morphological analysis of the sensory epithelium of the starling and pigeon basilar papilla the basilar papilla of the barn owl's (tyto alba) cochlea was found to be 9.5-11.5 mm long. histological examination revealed that the sensory hair cells had a characteristic distribution: the proximal half contained mostly typical short cells; tall hair cells were present only on the distal half along with many short cells. lenticular short cells occupied the proximal tip of the papilla. another unusual feature of the proximal part was a dense fibrous mass in the basilar membrane. this was absent from the distal one-fourth.
computational methodology for chip-seq analysis recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
effect of sertraline on breathing in depressed patients without moderate-to-severe sleep-related breathing disorders background previous studies have reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) might induce or exacerbate periodic limb movements during sleep (plms). however, most of these studies were retrospective and cross-sectional studies with small sample sizes on a selective ssri, fluoxetine. because different ssris have different pharmacologic profiles, it was not certain if other ssris also might lead to plms.   methods data were taken from an open-label 8-week trial of sertraline in depressive patients with insomnia (n=31). depressed patients were administered sertraline 50mg at 8:00am on the first day, and the dosage was subsequently titrated up to a maximum of 200mg daily during the 8-week trial. all participants were tested by repeated polysomnography (psg) (baseline, first day, 14th day, 28th day, and 56th day). periodic leg movements (plm) were visually counted and the plm index (plmi) was calculated. plms was defined as plmi ⩾5, and significant plms was defined as plmi ⩾15.   results compared with baseline (plmi, 3.6±1.5), all plmi indices increased on the immediate administration of sertraline on the first day (plmi, 5.1±3.9). from the 14th day onward, plmi became stable and significantly higher than baseline and the first day (8.7±3.1 on the 14th day, 8.3±3.7 on the 28th day, and 8.5±3.6 on the 56th day; f[11.81]; p=.003). the clinical responses and psg characteristics continuously improved during the 8-week trial. the plms group (plmi ⩾5) had a higher arousal index (ai) than the non-plms group on the 14th day (9.4±5.5 vs 5.2±3.7; t test, 4.22; p=.03) and the 56th day (8.1±5.5 vs 4.3±3.7; z score, 3.11; p=.04); albeit, there was no significant clinical disturbances in the plms group.   conclusions plms were increased during sertraline treatment, but only a few of the plms reached the significant level. this effect of sertraline on plms might be dosage dependent. although the sertraline-induced plms did not seem to cause significant clinical disturbance, the plms group (plmi ⩾5) had a higher ai than the non-plms group. thus clinicians should pay more attention to plms during ssri antidepressant treatment.
physiologic artifacts in resting state oscillations in young children: methodological considerations for noisy data evoked potentials and eegs record punctate electrical activity at electrode sites. to represent the overall potential distribution on the entire scalp it is necessary to interpolate between these sampled values. surface splines are mathematical tools for interpolating functions of two variables. in comparison to the classical methods of interpolation, based on linear combination of the potentials of the 4 nearest electrodes, spline methods are smoother, give more precisely located extrema and converge faster toward the 'true' potential surface when the number of recording electrodes is increased. these advantages are at the expense of lengthier computation time.
impact of the cftr-potentiator ivacaftor on airway microbiota in cystic fibrosis patients carrying a g551d mutation summary the common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (fwer). this approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. a different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. it calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. this error rate is equivalent to the fwer when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the fwer is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. a simple sequential bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. the use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.
age and education-matched cut-off scores for the revised german/swiss-german version of ecas abstract this study presents the edinburgh cognitive and behavioural als screen (ecas), developed for als patients with physical disability for use by health care professionals. the screen is designed to detect the specific profile of cognition and behaviour changes in als and to differentiate it from other disorders. forty-eight als patients (none with evident dementia), 40 healthy controls and 20 carers were recruited. the ecas, a 15–20-min screen, includes an als-specific score (executive functions and social cognition; fluency; language); an als non-specific score (memory; visuospatial functions); and a carer behaviour screen of five domains characteristic of frontotemporal dementia (ftd). data from healthy controls produced abnormality cut-offs of 77/100 als-specific score; 24/36 als non-specific score; 105/136 ecas total. twenty-nine percent of patients showed abnormal als-specific scores, and 6% also showed abnormal als non-specific scores. the most prevalent deficit occurred in language functions (35%) followed by executive functions and fluency (23% each). forty percent of carers reported behaviour change in at least one domain, while 15% met criteria for possible ftd. in conclusion, the ecas is an effective within-clinic assessment for als that determines the presence, severity and type of cognitive and/or behavioural changes, an essential first step to managing these symptoms.
measurement of eyeball rotational movements in the dark environment algorithms developed by the author for recognizing persons by their iris patterns have now been tested in many field and laboratory trials, producing no false matches in several million comparison tests. the recognition principle is the failure of a test of statistical independence on iris phase structure encoded by multi-scale quadrature wavelets. the combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 b/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. the high confidence levels are important because they allow very large databases to be searched exhaustively (one-to-many "identification mode") without making false matches, despite so many chances. biometrics that lack this property can only survive one-to-one ("verification") or few comparisons. the paper explains the iris recognition algorithms and presents results of 9.1 million comparisons among eye images from trials in britain, the usa, japan, and korea.
strong artificial selection in domestic mammals did not result in an increased recombination rate. analysis of diverse eukaryotes has revealed that recombination events cluster in discrete genomic locations known as hotspots. in humans, a zinc-finger protein, prdm9, is believed to initiate recombination in >40% of hotspots by binding to a specific dna sequence motif. however, the prdm9 coding sequence is disrupted in the dog genome assembly, raising questions regarding the nature and control of recombination in dogs. by analyzing the sequences of prdm9 orthologs in a number of dog breeds and several carnivores, we show here that this gene was inactivated early in canid evolution. we next use patterns of linkage disequilibrium using more than 170,000 snp markers typed in almost 500 dogs to estimate the recombination rates in the dog genome using a coalescent-based approach. broad-scale recombination rates show good correspondence with an existing linkage-based map. significant variation in recombination rate is observed on the fine scale, and we are able to detect over 4000 recombination hotspots with high confidence. in contrast to human hotspots, 40% of canine hotspots are characterized by a distinct peak in gc content. a comparative genomic analysis indicates that these peaks are present also as weaker peaks in the panda, suggesting that the hotspots have been continually reinforced by accelerated and strongly gc biased nucleotide substitutions, consistent with the long-term action of biased gene conversion on the dog lineage. these results are consistent with the loss of prdm9 in canids, resulting in a greater evolutionary stability of recombination hotspots. the genetic determinants of recombination hotspots in the dog genome may thus reflect a fundamental process of relevance to diverse animal species.
two domains of p 80 katanin regulate microtubule severing and spindle pole targeting by p 60 katanin microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis. the previous discovery of a cyclin b/cdc2-activated microtubule-severing activity in m-phase xenopus egg extracts suggested that a microtubule-severing protein might play an important role in cell cycle-dependent changes in microtubule dynamics and organization. however, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, ef1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin b/cdc2. here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of m-phase severing activity in xenopus eggs. this result suggests that katanin is responsible for changes in microtubules occurring at mitosis. immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that katanin is concentrated at a microtubule-dependent structure at mitotic spindle poles in xenopus a6 cells and in human fibroblasts, suggesting a specific role in microtubule disassembly at spindle poles. surprisingly, katanin was also found in adult mouse brain, indicating that katanin may have other functions distinct from its mitotic role.
surveillance of the colorectal cancer disparities among demographic subgroups: a spatial analysis both statistical ecology and environmental statistics have numerous challenges and opportunities in the waiting for the twenty-first century, calling for increasing numbers of nontraditional statistical approaches. both theoretical and applied ecology are using advancing data analytical and interpretational software and hardware to satisfy public policy and discovery research, variously incorporating geospatial information, site-specific data and remote sensing imagery. we discuss a declared need for geoinformatic surveillance for spatial critical area detection. we explore, for ecological and environmental use, an innovation of the circle-based spatial scan statistic popular in the health sciences.
batch-normalized maxout network in network we consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. we define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. we empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. we use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: mnist, cifar-10, cifar-100, and svhn.
systematically differentiating functions for alternatively spliced isoforms through integrating rna-seq data in pattern classification it is usually assumed that a training set of labeled patterns is available. multiple-instance learning (mil) generalizes this problem setting by making weaker assumptions about the labeling information. while each pattern is still believed to possess a true label, training labels are associated with sets or bags of patterns rather than individual patterns. more formally, given is a set of patterns x1, ...,xn grouped into bags x1, ..., xm, with xj = {xi : i ∈ ij} and ij ⊆ {1, ..., n}. with each bag xj is associated a label yj ∈ {−1, 1}. these labels are interpreted in the following way: if a bag has a negative label yj = −1, all patterns in that bag inherit the negative label. if on the other hand, yj = 1, then at least one pattern xi ∈ xj is a positive example of the underlying concept. the mil scenario has many interesting applications: one prominent application is the classification of molecules in the context of drug design (dietterich, lathrop, & lozanoperez 1997). here, each molecule is represented by a bag of possible conformations. another application is in image retrieval where images can be viewed as bags of local image patches (maron & ratan 1998) or image regions. algorithms for the mil problem were first presented in (dietterich, lathrop, & lozano-perez 1997; auer 1997; long & tan 1996). these methods (and analytical results) are based on hypothesis classes consisting of axisaligned rectangles. similarly, methods developed subsequently (e.g., (maron & lozano-perez 1998; zhang & goldman 2002)) have focused on specially tailored machine learning algorithms that do not compare favorably in the limiting case of bags of size 1 (the standard classification setting). a notable exception is (ramon & raedt 2000).
diversenet: when one right answer is not enough many practical perception systems exist within larger processes that include interactions with users or additional components capable of evaluating the quality of predicted solutions. in these contexts, it is beneficial to provide these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a single prediction. in this work, we pose the task of producing multiple outputs as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to an oracle. our method is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and loss function, and parameter-free. our approach achieves lower oracle error compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures. we also show qualitatively that the diverse solutions produced often provide interpretable representations of task ambiguity.
organic acid profile of isovaleric acidemia: a comprehensive metabolomics approach isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
decision-makers’ preferences for approving new medicines in wales: a discrete-choice experiment with assessment of external validity the decisions made by the national institute for clinical excellence (nice) give rise to two questions: how is cost-effectiveness evidence used to make judgements about the 'value for money' of health technologies? and how are factors other than cost-effectiveness taken into account? the aim of this paper is to explore nice's cost-effectiveness threshold(s) and the tradeoffs between cost effectiveness and other factors apparent in its decisions. binary choice analysis is used to reveal the preferences of nice and to consider the consistency of its decisions. for each decision to accept or reject a technology, explanatory variables include: the cost per life year or per qaly gained; uncertainty regarding cost effectiveness; the net cost to the nhs; the burden of disease; the availability (or not) of alternative treatments; and specific factors indicated by nice. results support the broad notion of a threshold, where the probability of rejection increases as the cost per qaly increases. cost effectiveness, together with uncertainty and the burden of disease, explain nice decisions better than cost effectiveness alone. the results suggest a threshold somewhat higher than nices stated 'range of acceptable cost effectiveness' of pound 20,000-30,000 british pounds per qaly--although the exact meaning of a 'range' in this context remains unclear.
virulence potential and genomic mapping of the worldwide clone escherichia coli st131 an ongoing outbreak of exceptionally virulent shiga toxin (stx)-producing escherichia coli o104:h4 centered in germany, has caused over 830 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) and 46 deaths since may 2011. serotype o104:h4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with hus in the past. to prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the life technologies ion torrent pgm™ sequencer and optical mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (lb226692) and a historic o104:h4 hus isolate from 2001 (01-09591). reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced pgm™ within 62 hours. the hus-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec) and enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec). phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core e. coli genes indicate that the hus-causing o104:h4 strains and the previously published sequence of the eaec strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common ehec serotypes. though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. we propose a model in which eaec 55989 and ehec o104:h4 strains evolved from a common ehec o104:h4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of eaec and ehec emerged as the current outbreak clone. in conclusion, rapid next-generation technologies facilitated prospective whole genome characterization in the early stages of an outbreak.
antisense rna polymerase ii divergent transcripts are p-tefb dependent and substrates for the rna exosome transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii (rnapii) is thought to occur unidirectionally from most genes. here, we present evidence of widespread divergent transcription at protein-encoding gene promoters. transcription start site–associated rnas (tssa-rnas) nonrandomly flank active promoters, with peaks of antisense and sense short rnas at 250 nucleotides upstream and 50 nucleotides downstream of tsss, respectively. northern analysis shows that tssa-rnas are subsets of an rna population 20 to 90 nucleotides in length. promoter-associated rnapii and h3k4-trimethylated histones, transcription initiation hallmarks, colocalize at sense and antisense tssa-rna positions; however, h3k79-dimethylated histones, characteristic of elongating rnapii, are only present downstream of tsss. these results suggest that divergent transcription over short distances is common for active promoters and may help promoter regions maintain a state poised for subsequent regulation.
genome-wide survey of two-component signal transduction systems in the plant growth-promoting bacterium azospirillum magnifying genomes (mage) is a microbial genome annotation system based on a relational database containing information on bacterial genomes, as well as a web interface to achieve genome annotation projects. our system allows one to initiate the annotation of a genome at the early stage of the finishing phase. mage's main features are (i) integration of annotation data from bacterial genomes enhanced by a gene coding re-annotation process using accurate gene models, (ii) integration of results obtained with a wide range of bioinformatics methods, among which exploration of gene context by searching for conserved synteny and reconstruction of metabolic pathways, (iii) an advanced web interface allowing multiple users to refine the automatic assignment of gene product functions. mage is also linked to numerous well-known biological databases and systems. our system has been thoroughly tested during the annotation of complete bacterial genomes (acinetobacter baylyi adp1, pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, frankia alni) and is currently used in the context of several new microbial genome annotation projects. in addition, mage allows for annotation curation and exploration of already published genomes from various genera (e.g. yersinia, bacillus and neisseria). mage can be accessed at .
halide dependence of the halorhodopsin photocycle as measured by time-resolved infrared spectra. abstract— step‐scan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with 50 ns time resolution was applied to the early stages of the photocycle of halorhodopsin (hr) for the temperature range 3‐42° c. kinetic data analysis with global fitting revealed two distinct kinetic processes associated with relaxations of the early red‐shifted photoproduct hk; these processes have time constants t1⋍ 280 ns and t2⋍ 360 μs at 20°c. spectral features demonstrate that the t1 process corresponds to a transition between two distinct bathointermediates, hke and hkl. the vibrational difference bands associated with both t1 and t2 transitions are spread throughout the whole 1800‐900 cm−1 range. however, the largest bands correspond to ethylenic c=c stretches, fingerprint c‐c stretches and hydrogen out‐of‐plane (hoop) wags of the retinal chromophore. the time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the t1 and t2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. the decay of the intense hoop vibrations is nearly equally divided between the t1 and t2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hke) bathointermediate, to a less‐twisted structure in hkl, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hl intermediate. this conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the t1 process. the two relaxations from hke to hl are largely analogous to corresponding relaxations (ke→ kl→ l) in the bacterior‐hodopsin photocycle, except that the second step is slowed down by over 200‐fold in hr.
utility of pre-treatment neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and platelet–lymphocyte ratio as prognostic factors in breast cancer background: inflammation influences cancer development and progression. an elevated platelet to lymphocyte ratio (plr), a marker of inflammation, has been linked to poor prognosis in several malignancies. here, we quantify the prognostic impact of this biomarker. methods: a systematic review of databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association of blood plr and overall survival (os) in solid tumors. data were pooled in a meta-analysis. pooled hrs for os by disease group and by plr cutoff groups were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling. results: twenty studies comprising 12,754 patients were assessed. cutoffs for plr defining risk groups ranged from 150 to 300 and were dichotomous (12 studies; group 1) or split into three groups (<150/150–300/>300, 8 studies; group 2). higher plr was associated with significantly worse os in group 1 [hr = 1.87; 95% confidence interval (ci, 1.49–2.34); p < 0.001] and with a nonsignificant association in group 2 (hr per higher category = 1.21; 95%ci, 0.97–1.50; p = 0.10). the size of effect of plr on os was greater for metastatic disease (hr[group 1] = 2.0; 95% ci, 1.6–2.7; hr[group 2] = 1.6; 95% ci, 1.1–2.4) than for early-stage disease (hr[group 1] = 1.5; 95% ci, 1.0–2.2; hr[group 2] = 1.0; 95% ci, 0.8–1.3). a significant association was observed for colorectal, hepatocellular, gastroesophageal, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinoma in group 1 and for colorectal cancers in group 2. conclusion: a high plr is associated with worse os in various solid tumors. further research of its regulation and relevance in daily practice is warranted. impact: plr is a readily available and inexpensive biomarker with independent prognostic value in solid tumors. cancer epidemiol biomarkers prev; 23(7); 1204–12. ©2014 aacr.
the effect of anethum graveolens l. (dill) on corticosteroid induced diabetes mellitus: involvement of thyroid hormones scopoletin (7‐hydroxy‐6‐methoxy coumarin) was isolated from the leaves of aegle marmelos and evaluated for its potential to regulate hyperthyroidism, lipid peroxidation and hyperglycemia in levo‐thyroxine‐induced hyperthyroid rats. scopoletin (1.00 mg/kg, p.o.) administered daily for 7 days to levo‐thyroxine‐treated animals decreased the levels of serum thyroid hormones and glucose as well as hepatic glucose‐6‐phosphatase activity, demonstrating its potential to regulate hyperthyroidism and hyperglycemia. scopoletin also inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation and increased the activity of antioxidants, superoxide dismutase and catalase. compared with the standard antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil, scopoletin exhibited a superior therapeutic activity, since unlike propylthiouracil, it also inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation. these findings indicate that scopoletin has the potential to inhibit thyroid function and hyperglycemia without hepatotoxicity. copyright © 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.
breath-by-breath fluctuations of pulmonary gas exchange and ventilation in copd patients excess co2 is generated when lactate is increased during exercise because its [h+] is buffered primarily by hco-3 (22 ml for each meq of lactic acid). we developed a method to detect the anaerobic threshold (at), using computerized regression analysis of the slopes of the co2 uptake (vco2) vs. o2 uptake (vo2) plot, which detects the beginning of the excess co2 output generated from the buffering of [h+], termed the v-slope method. from incremental exercise tests on 10 subjects, the point of excess co2 output (at) predicted closely the lactate and hco-3 thresholds. the mean gas exchange at was found to correspond to a small increment of lactate above the mathematically defined lactate threshold [0.50 +/- 0.34 (sd) meq/l] and not to differ significantly from the estimated hco-3 threshold. the mean vo2 at at computed by the v-slope analysis did not differ significantly from the mean value determined by a panel of six experienced reviewers using traditional visual methods, but the at could be more reliably determined by the v-slope method. the respiratory compensation point, detected separately by examining the minute ventilation vs. vco2 plot, was consistently higher than the at (2.51 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.30 l/min of vo2). this method for determining the at has significant advantages over others that depend on regular breathing pattern and respiratory chemosensitivity.
a novel atac-seq approach reveals lineage-specific reinforcement of the open chromatin landscape via cooperation between baf and p63 chromatin structure can affect the transcriptional activity of eukaryotic structural genes by blocking access of sequence-specific activator proteins (activators) to their promoter-binding sites1. for example, the dna-binding domain of the yeast gal4 protein interacts very poorly with nucleosome cores compared with naked dna2 (and see below), and binding of other activators is even more strongly inhibited2,3. the way in which activators bind to nucleosomal dna is therefore a critical aspect of transcriptional activation. genetic studies have suggested that the multi-component swi/snf complex of saccharomyces cerevisiae facilitates transcription by altering the structure of the chromatin4,5. here we identify and partially purify a human homologue of the yeast swi/snf complex (hswi/snf complex). we show that a partially purified hswi/snf complex mediates the atp-dependent disruption of a nucleosome, thereby enabling the activators, gal4–vp16 and gal4–ah, to bind within a nucleosome core. we conclude that the hswi/snf complex acts directly to reorganize chromatin structure so as to facilitate binding of transcription factors.
the neonatal sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase gives a clue to development and pathology in human muscles the relative mrna levels corresponding to the different sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum ca(2+)-atpase isoforms (serca1a, serca1b, serca2a, serca2b and serca3) were measured by reverse transcriptase-pcr in rat soleus muscles regenerating after notexin-induced necrosis. the succession of appearance of the different types of serca mrna species in regenerating muscle largely recapitulates those observed during normal ontogenesis. the mrna levels of the muscle-specific isoforms serca1a and serca2a became very low on the first and third days after injection of the snake venom. it was only on the fifth day of regeneration that the mrna of the neonatal variant of the fast-twitch skeletal serca1b isoform began to rise, well before the other serca transcripts. at 7 and 10 days, i.e. at a time when the new myofibres normally become reinnervated, the mrna level of serca1a and serca2a increased markedly, but the fast-twitch skeletal serca1a isoform was still the most prominent. on day 21, in the advanced stage of regeneration, a switch in the relative expression levels of serca1a and serca2a mrna was observed and the ratio of both isoforms became similar to that found in the normal soleus muscles. this was followed by a decline in the level of all serca mrna species, so that on day 28 the levels of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmatic-reticulum ca(2+)-pump rnas was again lower but their ratio remained similar to that of the untreated control soleus.
breast motion asymmetry during running abstract although breast pain has been related to vertical breast displacement and velocity, the influence of breast support on multi-planar breast kinematics and breast comfort has yet to be ascertained. the aims of this study were to investigate multi-planar breast displacement, velocity, and acceleration with and without breast support during running and to establish the correlation with breast comfort. fifteen females ran at 2.8 m · s−1 in no bra, an everyday bra, and a sports bra. three-dimensional coordinates of breast and body markers were tracked during ten gait cycles and following each trial the participants rated their breast comfort. relative breast displacement was calculated and derived for velocity and acceleration. vertical breast displacement, velocity, and acceleration peaked at, before, and after mid-stance, respectively. the patterns of displacement and velocity trajectories were unaffected by increasing breast support, though the magnitudes were significantly reduced. the magnitude and trajectory of breast acceleration was unaffected by increasing breast support and showed no correlation with comfort. breast velocity displayed the strongest relationship to comfort (r = 0.61). considerable mediolateral and anteroposterior breast kinematics were identified, suggesting that future studies and bra design may benefit from three-dimensional analysis. in conclusion, improvements in breast support may be defined by reductions in breast velocity and displacement.
habitat at the mountain tops: how long can rock ptarmigan (lagopus muta helvetica) survive rapid climate change in the swiss alps? a multi-scale approach with the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and gis tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. a wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. in this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. the variety of statistical techniques used is growing. ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (glm) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. gam), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. the selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche). conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. in the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. new methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (roc)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. the choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. this may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. in turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. © 2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.
