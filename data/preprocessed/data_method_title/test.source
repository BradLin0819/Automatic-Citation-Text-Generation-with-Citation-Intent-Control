homeostatic regulation of h‐conductance controls intrinsic excitability and stabilizes the threshold for synaptic modification in ca1 neurons in the cortex, synaptic latencies display small variations ( approximately 1-2 ms) that are generally considered to be negligible. we show here that the synaptic latency at monosynaptically connected pairs of l5 and ca3 pyramidal neurons is determined by the presynaptic release probability (pr): synaptic latency being inversely correlated with the amplitude of the postsynaptic current and sensitive to manipulations of pr. changes in synaptic latency were also observed when pr was physiologically regulated in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. paired-pulse depression and facilitation were respectively associated with increased and decreased synaptic latencies. similarly, latencies were prolonged following induction of presynaptic ltd and reduced after ltp induction. we show using the dynamic-clamp technique that the observed covariation in latency and synaptic strength is a synergistic combination that significantly affects postsynaptic spiking. in conclusion, amplitude-related variation in latency represents a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics in cortical networks.
human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung progenitor and alveolar epithelial cells attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung injury. the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) provides the opportunity to use patient‐specific somatic cells, which are a valuable source for disease modeling and drug discovery. to promote research involving these cells, it is important to make ipscs from easily accessible and less invasive tissues, like blood. we have recently reported the efficient generation of human ipscs from adult fibroblasts using a combination of plasmids encoding oct3/4, sox2, klf4, l‐myc, lin28, and shrna for tp53. we herein report a modified protocol enabling efficient ipsc induction from cd34+ cord blood cells and from peripheral blood isolated from healthy donors using these plasmid vectors. the original plasmid mixture could induce ipscs; however, the efficiency was low. the addition of ebna1, an essential factor for episomal amplification of the vectors, by an extra plasmid greatly increased the efficiency of ipsc induction, especially when the induction was performed from αβt cells. this improvement enabled the establishment of blood‐derived ipscs from seven healthy donors ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s. this induction method will be useful for the derivation of patient‐specific integration‐free ipscs and would also be applicable to the generation of clinical‐grade ipscs in the future. stem cells2013;31:458–466
comparative effectiveness of different types of splenectomy for children with congenital hemolytic anemias. background open partial splenectomy provides reversal of anemia and relief of symptomatic splenomegaly while theoretically retaining splenic immune function for hereditary spherocytosis. we recently developed a laparoscopic approach for partial splenectomy. the purpose of the present study is to compare the outcomes in a group of patients undergoing laparoscopic partial splenectomy (lps) with those in a group of children undergoing laparoscopic total splenectomy (lts) over the same period.   methods systematic chart review was conducted of all children with hereditary spherocytosis who had lts or lps from 2000 to 2006 at the hospital for sick children, toronto, ontario, canada. t tests were used for continuous data, and chi(2) for proportional data; p value of less than .05 was considered significant.   results there were 9 patients (14 males) in each group. groups were similar in sex, age, concomitant cholecystectomy, and preoperative hospitalizations, transfusions, and spleen size. estimated blood loss was greater in the lps group (188 + 53 vs 67 + 17 ml; p = .02), but transfusion requirements were similar (1/9 vs 0/9). complication rate was similar between groups. the lps group had higher morphine use (4.1 + 0.6 vs 2.4 + 0.2 days; p = .03), greater time to oral intake (4.4 + 0.7 vs 2.0 + 0.2 days; p = .01), and longer hospital stay (6.3 + 1.0 vs 2.7 + 0.3 days; p = .005) than the lts group. nuclear scan 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively demonstrated residual perfused splenic tissue in all lps patients. no completion splenectomy was necessary after a mean follow-up of 25 months.   conclusion these data suggest that lps is as effective as lts for control of symptoms. however, lps is associated with more pain, longer time to oral intake, and longer hospital stay. these disadvantages may be balanced by retained splenic immune function, but further studies are required to assess long-term splenic function in these patients.
vessel segmentation and catheter detection in x-ray angiograms using superpixels segmentation of coronary arteries in x-ray angiography is a fundamental tool to evaluate arterial diseases and choose proper coronary treatment. the accurate segmentation of coronary arteries has become an important topic for the registration of different modalities, which allows physicians rapid access to different medical imaging information from computed tomography (ct) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (mri). in this paper, we propose an accurate fully automatic algorithm based on graph-cuts for vessel centerline extraction, caliber estimation, and catheter detection. vesselness, geodesic paths, and a new multiscale edgeness map are combined to customize the graph-cuts approach to the segmentation of tubular structures, by means of a global optimization of the graph-cuts energy function. moreover, a novel supervised learning methodology that integrates local and contextual information is proposed for automatic catheter detection. we evaluate the method performance on three datasets coming from different imaging systems. the method performs as good as the expert observer with respect to centerline detection and caliber estimation. moreover, the method discriminates between arteries and catheter with an accuracy of 96.5%, sensitivity of 72%, and precision of 97.4%.
novel solutions for side information generation and fusion in multiview dvc this paper introduces a hybrid forward-error correction/automatic repeat-request (arq) system that employs rate compatible punctured turbo (rcpt) codes to achieve enhanced throughput performance over a nonstationary gaussian channel. the proposed rcpt-arq system combines the performance of turbo codes with the frugal use of incremental redundancy inherent in the rate compatible punctured convolutional codes of hagenauer (1988). moreover, this paper introduces the notion of puncturing the systematic code symbols of a turbo code to maximize throughput at signal-to-noise ratios (snrs) of interest. the resulting system provides both an efficient family of achievable code rates at middle to high snr and powerful low-rate error correction capability at low snr.
efficient exon skipping of sgcg mutations mediated by phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. backgroundcellular models of muscle disease are taking on increasing importance with the large number of genes and mutations implicated in causing myopathies and the concomitant need to test personalized therapies. developing cell models relies on having an easily obtained source of cells, and if the cells are not derived from muscle itself, a robust reprogramming process is needed. fibroblasts are a human cell source that works well for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can then be differentiated into cardiomyocyte lineages, and with less efficiency, skeletal muscle-like lineages. alternatively, direct reprogramming with the transcription factor myod has been used to generate myotubes from cultured human fibroblasts. although useful, fibroblasts require a skin biopsy to obtain and this can limit their access, especially from pediatric populations.resultswe now demonstrate that direct reprogramming of urine-derived cells is a highly efficient and reproducible process that can be used to establish human myogenic cells. we show that this method can be applied to urine cells derived from normal individuals as well as those with muscle diseases. furthermore, we show that urine-derived cells can be edited using crispr/cas9 technology.conclusionswith progress in understanding the molecular etiology of human muscle diseases, having a readily available, noninvasive source of cells from which to generate muscle-like cells is highly useful.
social determinants of health in the united states: addressing major health inequality trends for the nation, 1935-2016 background there is limited research on rural-urban disparities in u.s. life expectancy.   purpose this study examined trends in rural-urban disparities in life expectancy at birth in the u.s. between 1969 and 2009.   methods the 1969-2009 u.s. county-level mortality data linked to a rural-urban continuum measure were analyzed. life expectancies were calculated by age, gender, and race for 3-year time periods between 1969 and 2004 and for 2005-2009 using standard life-table methodology. differences in life expectancy were decomposed by age and cause of death.   results life expectancy was inversely related to levels of rurality. in 2005-2009, those in large metropolitan areas had a life expectancy of 79.1 years, compared with 76.9 years in small urban towns and 76.7 years in rural areas. when stratified by gender, race, and income, life expectancy ranged from 67.7 years among poor black men in nonmetropolitan areas to 89.6 among poor asian/pacific islander women in metropolitan areas. rural-urban disparities widened over time. in 1969-1971, life expectancy was 0.4 years longer in metropolitan than in nonmetropolitan areas (70.9 vs 70.5 years). by 2005-2009, the life expectancy difference had increased to 2.0 years (78.8 vs 76.8 years). the rural poor and rural blacks currently experience survival probabilities that urban rich and urban whites enjoyed 4 decades earlier. causes of death contributing most to the increasing rural-urban disparity and lower life expectancy in rural areas include heart disease, unintentional injuries, copd, lung cancer, stroke, suicide, and diabetes.   conclusions between 1969 and 2009, residents in metropolitan areas experienced larger gains in life expectancy than those in nonmetropolitan areas, contributing to the widening gap.
cardiovascular effects of tramadol in dogs anesthetized with sevoflurane. objective to compare morphine with tramadol for the management of early postoperative pain following ovariohysterectomy after pyometra in dogs.   study design prospective randomized blinded clinical trial.   animals thirty female dogs, 2-14 years old.   methods animals were randomly divided into two equal groups. group 1 received 0.2 mg kg-1 of morphine iv and group 2 received 2 mg kg-1 of tramadol iv after the induction of anesthesia. the dogs were premedicated with acepromazine, and anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam and ketamine. isoflurane was used for the maintenance of anesthesia. the variables measured were: analgesia; sedation; cardiac and respiratory rates; arterial blood pressure; end-tidal isoflurane and carbon dioxide (pe'co2); oxyhemoglobin saturation (spo2); plasma catecholamines; serum cortisol and glucose concentrations; ph and blood gases. the animals were monitored for 6 hours after the administration of the analgesic agent.   results there were no differences between the two groups with regard to analgesia, sedation, spo2, ph and blood gases, cardiovascular variables, glucose, catecholamine and cortisol concentrations. forty minutes postopioid administration, the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly lower in the morphine-treated group as compared to the tramadol group. at 30 minutes following opioid injection, pe'co2 was significantly higher in the morphine group than in the tramadol group. two dogs in the tramadol group and one in the morphine group were given morphine postoperatively because of increasing pain scores.   conclusion and clinical relevance morphine and tramadol, administered preemptively can be used safely in dogs to control early pain after ovariohysterectomy without significant adverse effects.
the relationships between self-rated health and serum lipids across time background the purpose of this study is to test whether the predictive power of an individual's self-rated health (srh) on subsequent mortality risk differs by socioeconomic status (ses) in the united states.   methods we use the national health interview survey 1986-94 linked to multiple cause of death files 1986-97 (nhis-mcd). analyses are based on non-hispanic black and white adults 25 and older (n = 358,388). cox proportional hazard models are used to estimate the effect of srh on mortality risk during follow-up. interactions of srh and level of education and srh and level of income are used to assess differences in the predictive power of srh for subsequent mortality risk.   results the effect of srh on subsequent mortality risk differs by level of education and level of income. lower health ratings are more strongly associated with mortality for adults with higher education and/or higher income relative to their lower ses counterparts.   conclusions our findings suggest that individuals with different education or income levels may evaluate their health differently with respect to the traditional five-point srh scale, and hence their subjective health ratings may not be directly comparable. these results have important implications for research that tries to quantify and explain socioeconomic inequalities in health based on self-rated health.
bootstrapping monte carlo tree search with an imperfect heuristic the uct algorithm learns a value function online using sample-based search. the td(λ) algorithm can learn a value function offline for the on-policy distribution. we consider three approaches for combining offline and online value functions in the uct algorithm. first, the offline value function is used as a default policy during monte-carlo simulation. second, the uct value function is combined with a rapid online estimate of action values. third, the offline value function is used as prior knowledge in the uct search tree. we evaluate these algorithms in 9 x 9 go against gnugo 3.7.10. the first algorithm performs better than uct with a random simulation policy, but surprisingly, worse than uct with a weaker, handcrafted simulation policy. the second algorithm outperforms uct altogether. the third algorithm outperforms uct with handcrafted prior knowledge. we combine these algorithms in mogo, the world's strongest 9 x 9 go program. each technique significantly improves mogo's playing strength.
full dynamic interchangeability with forward checking and arc consistency we introduce a new method, called symmetry excluding search (ses), for excluding symmetries in constraint based search. to our knowledge, it is the first declarative method that can be applied to arbitrary symmetries. the ses-method is based on the notion of symmetric constraints, which are used in our modification of a general constraint based search algorithm. the method does not influence the search strategy. furthermore, it can be used with either the full set of symmetries, or a subset of all symmetries.we proof correctness, completeness and symmetry exclusion properties of our method. then, we show how to apply the ses-method in the special case of geometric symmetries (rotations and reflections) and permutation symmetries. furthermore, we give results from practical applications.
stat is an essential activator of the zygotic genome in the early drosophila embryo stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) is a potent transcription factor and its aberrant activation by phosphorylation is associated with human cancers. we have shown previously that overactivation of jak, which phosphorylates stat, disrupts heterochromatin formation globally in drosophila melanogaster. however, it remains unclear how this effect is mediated and whether stat is involved. here, we demonstrate that drosophila stat (stat92e) is involved in controlling heterochromatin protein 1 (hp1) distribution and heterochromatin stability. we found, unexpectedly, that loss of stat92e, had the same effects as overactivation of jak in disrupting heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing, whereas overexpression of stat92e had the opposite effects. we have further shown that the unphosphorylated or 'transcriptionally inactive' form of stat92e is localized on heterochromatin in association with hp1, and is required for stabilizing hp1 localization and histone h3 lys 9 methylation (h3mk9) . however, activation by phosphorylation reduces heterochromatin-associated stat92e, causing hp1 displacement and heterochromatin destabilization. thus, reducing levels of unphosphorylated stat92e, either by loss of stat92e or increased phosphorylation, causes heterochromatin instability. these results suggest that activation of stat by phosphorylation controls both access to chromatin and activity of the transcription machinery.
loss of genetic connectivity and diversity in urban microreserves in a southern california endemic jerusalem cricket (orthoptera: stenopelmatidae: stenopelmatus n. sp. “santa monica”) with the aim of analyzing and interpreting data on dna polymorphism obtained by dna sequencing or restriction enzyme technique, a mathematical theory on the expected evolutionary relationship among dna sequences (nucleons) sampled is developed under the assumption that the evolutionary change of nucleons is determined solely by mutation and random genetic drift. the statistical property of the number of nucleotide differences between randomly chosen nucleons and that of heterozygosity or nucleon diversity is investigated using this theory. these studies indicate that the estimates of the average number of nucleotide differences and nucleon diversity have a large variance, and a large part of this variance is due to stochastic factors. therefore, increasing sample size does not help reduce the variance significantly the distribution of sample allele (nucleomorph) frequencies is also studied, and it is shown that a small number of samples are sufficient in order to know the distribution pattern.
adaptive computation time for recurrent neural networks we introduce adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. the method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. the method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. the hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. some connections to related algorithms, on which adam was inspired, are discussed. we also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. empirical results demonstrate that adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. finally, we discuss adamax, a variant of adam based on the infinity norm.
identification of novel pikfyve gene mutations associated with fleck corneal dystrophy genetic polymorphisms are often considered as risk factors of complex diseases serving as valuable and easily detectable biomarkers, also stable during the whole lifespan. a novel type of genetic polymorphism has been identified just recently, referred to as gene copy number variation (cnv) or copy number polymorphism. cnv of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and its adjacent gene, nr1i2 (pregnane x receptor isoform), has been reported to associate with bipolar depression. in our study we introduced multicapillary electrophoresis for gene copy number analysis as an affordable alternative to real‐time pcr quantification with taqman gene probes. our results show the reliability of the developed method based on conventional pcr followed by separation of products by multicapillary electrophoresis with quantitative evaluation. this method can be readily implemented for the analysis of candidate gene cnvs in high throughput clinical laboratories and also in personalized medicine care of depression‐related risk factors.
waveseq: a novel data-driven method of detecting histone modification enrichments using wavelets a practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the el nino–southern oscillation (enso). the guide includes a comparison to the windowed fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and fourier frequency. new statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. it is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power hovmoller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. the statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of change...
biased subspace learning for misalignment-robust facial expression recognition we propose an appearance-based face recognition method called the laplacianface approach. by using locality preserving projections (lpp), the face images are mapped into a face subspace for analysis. different from principal component analysis (pca) and linear discriminant analysis (lda) which effectively see only the euclidean structure of face space, lpp finds an embedding that preserves local information, and obtains a face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold structure. the laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the laplace beltrami operator on the face manifold. in this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced. theoretical analysis shows that pca, lda, and lpp can be obtained from different graph models. we compare the proposed laplacianface approach with eigenface and fisherface methods on three different face data sets. experimental results suggest that the proposed laplacianface approach provides a better representation and achieves lower error rates in face recognition.
linking hydrology, ecosystem function, and livelihood outcomes in african papyrus wetlands using a bayesian network model a bayesian belief network (bn) for farming contracts has been constructed and validated with direct co-operation and in dialogue with stakeholders. on the one hand, bn’s can create space for an open dialogue with stakeholders due to the flexibility of the decision support tool. this allows factors (nodes), associations (directed links) and probabilities to be adjusted and validated throughout the process and based on inputs from all involved stakeholders and experts. on the other hand getting stakeholders to understand and accept the idea behind bns is demanding. especially the required probability assessments are not easy to understand by stakeholders. copyright © 2004 ifac
dense 3d regression for hand pose estimation we present a novel method for real-time continuous pose recovery of markerless complex articulable objects from a single depth image. our method consists of the following stages: a randomized decision forest classifier for image segmentation, a robust method for labeled dataset generation, a convolutional network for dense feature extraction, and finally an inverse kinematics stage for stable real-time pose recovery. as one possible application of this pipeline, we show state-of-the-art results for real-time puppeteering of a skinned hand-model.
glycosphingolipid gm3 is indispensable for dengue virus genome replication replicon systems have been used for high-throughput screening of anti-dengue virus (anti-denv) inhibitors and for understanding mechanisms of viral replication. in the present study, we constructed novel denv-1 replicons encoding gaussia luciferase that was secreted into the culture medium. two types of constructs were generated: rna-based and dna-based. each type was translated in an internal ribosome entry site (ires)-dependent or ires-independent manner. among these constructs, the dna-based replicon employing ires-dependent translation (dgl2) produced the highest titer. luciferase levels in the culture medium revealed that the dgl2 replicon was inhibited by ribavirin (a well-known denv inhibitor) at levels similar to those measured for drug inhibition of multi-round denv-1 infection. these results indicate that the dna-based ires-driven denv-1 replicon may facilitate studies on viral replication and antiviral compound discovery.
the nin transcription factor coordinates diverse nodulation programs in different tissues of the medicago truncatula root[open] lipochitooligosaccharide nodulation factors (nfs) secreted by endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia trigger ca2+ spiking in the cytoplasmic perinuclear region of host legume root hairs. to determine whether nfs also elicit ca2+ responses within the plant cell nucleus we have made use of a nucleoplasmin-tagged cameleon (nupyc2.1). confocal microscopy using this nuclear-specific calcium reporter has revealed sustained and regular ca2+ spiking within the nuclear compartment of medicago truncatula root hairs treated with sinorhizobium meliloti nfs. since the activation of ca2+ oscillations is blocked in m. truncatula nfp, dmi1, and dmi2 mutants, and unaltered in a dmi3 background, it is likely that intranuclear spiking lies on the established nf-dependent signal transduction pathway, leading to cytoplasmic calcium spiking. a semiautomated mathematical procedure has been developed to identify and analyze nuclear ca2+ spiking profiles, and has revealed high cell-to-cell variability in terms of both periodicity and spike duration. time-lapse imaging of the cameleon förster resonance energy transfer-based ratio has allowed us to visualize the nuclear spiking variability in situ and to demonstrate the absence of spiking synchrony between adjacent growing root hairs. finally, spatio-temporal analysis of the asymmetric nuclear spike suggests that the initial rapid increase in ca2+ concentration occurs principally in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope. the discovery that rhizobial nf perception leads to the activation of cell-autonomous ca2+ oscillations on both sides of the nuclear envelope raises major questions about the respective roles of the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in transducing this key endosymbiotic signal.
a semantic negotiation model for service property value between service agents the agent metaphor has shown its usefulness for modelling as well as implementing complex and dynamic applications. although a number of agent applications has been successfully realised and used, it must be stated that the distribution of commercial off-the-shelf applications is very scarce. for this discontenting situation, at least two reasons can be identified. on the one hand, the development of agent-based applications is difficult suffering from insufficient standards and tools and on the other hand deployment issues are little researched and supported. in this paper, several deployment-related topics are discussed and a vision for the deployment of distributed multi-agent systems is conceived. from the vision, requirements for launching and configuring agent applications are derived. according to these requirements, a platform independent reference model of the proposed deployment infrastructure is presented. the reference model provides the basis for the development of our ascml (agent society configuration manager and launcher) tool, which is currently implemented for the jade and jadex multi-agent platforms.
protein structural model selection by combining consensus and single scoring methods for a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. we have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern‐recognition process of hydrogen‐bonded and geometrical features extracted from x‐ray coordinates. cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen‐bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive cα positions and is positive for right‐handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β‐sheets. curved pieces are defined as “bends.” solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. the end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including ss bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. the presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. the dictionary is also available in computer‐readable form for protein structure prediction work.
weblogo-2m: scalable logo detection by deep learning from the web state-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. advances like sppnet and fast r-cnn have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. in this work, we introduce a region proposal network (rpn) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. an rpn is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. the rpn is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by fast r-cnn for detection. we further merge rpn and fast r-cnn into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the rpn component tells the unified network where to look. for the very deep vgg-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a gpu, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on pascal voc 2007, 2012, and ms coco datasets with only 300 proposals per image. in ilsvrc and coco 2015 competitions, faster r-cnn and rpn are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. code has been made publicly available
advantages of joint modeling of component hiv risk behaviors and non-response: application to randomized trials in cocaine-dependent and methamphetamine-dependent populations multivariate longitudinal data with mixed continuous and discrete responses with the possibility of non-ignorable missingness are often common in follow-up medical studies and their analysis needs to be developed. standard methods of analysis based on the strong and the unverifiable assumption of missing at random (mar) mechanism could be highly misleading. a way out of this problem is to start with methods that simultaneously allow modelling non-ignorable mechanism, which includes somehow troubling computations that are often time consuming, then we can use a sensitivity analysis, in which one estimates models under a range of assumptions about non-ignorability parameters to study the impact of these parameters on key inferences. a general index of sensitivity to non-ignorability (isni) to measure sensitivity of key inferences in a neighborhood of mar model without fitting a complicated not mar (nmar) model for univariate generalized linear models and for models used for univariate longitudinal normal and non-gaussian data with potentially nmar dropout are well presented in the literature. in this paper we extend isni methodology to analyze multivariate longitudinal mixed data subject to non-ignorable dropout in which the non-ignorable dropout model could be dependent on the mixed responses. the approach is illustrated by analyzing a longitudinal data set in which the general substantive goal of the study is to better understand the relations between parental assessment of child's antisocial behavior and child's reading recognition skill.
babesia spp. in ticks and wildlife in different habitat types of slovakia we describe muscle, a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. the speed and accuracy of muscle are compared with t-coffee, mafft and clustalw on four test sets of reference alignments: balibase, sabmark, smart and a new benchmark, prefab. muscle achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. without refinement, muscle achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from t-coffee and mafft, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. the muscle program, source code and prefab test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.
prevention of arterial stiffening by using low-dose atorvastatin in diabetes is associated with decreased malondialdehyde human plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (lcat) transacylates the sn-2 fatty acid of lecithin to cholesterol forming cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. measurement of the phospholipase a2 and transacylase activities of the enzyme using proteoliposome substrates and following selective chemical modification of serine, histidine, and cysteine residues of pure homogeneous lcat indicated the following catalytic mechanism: hs-cys-e-ser-oh + lecithin in equilibrium hs-cys-e-ser-o-fa + lysolecithin, hs-cys-e-ser-o-fa in equilibrium fa-s-cys-e-ser-oh, fa-s-cys-e-ser-oh + cholesterol-oh in equilibrium hs-cys-e-ser-oh + cholesterol-o-fa, where fa denotes fatty acid. modification of 2 lcat cysteine residues with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or treatment with ferricyanide inactivated the transacylase but not the phospholipase a2 activity. modification of 1 serine residue with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or 1 histidine residue with diethyl pyrocarbonate inhibited cholesteryl ester formation and phospholipase a2 activity. proteoliposome substrates protected both activities against chemical inactivation. lecithin alone protected the phospholipase a2 activity against phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride inactivation but not the transacylase against 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inactivation. incubation of native lcat with arachidonyl-coa or the lecithin-apo-a-i proteoliposome resulted in acylation of three enzyme sites, only one of which was stable to neutral hydroxylamine after denaturation. fatty acylenzyme oxy- and thioesters were demonstrable in both cases. no transfer of arachidonic acid from iodoacetamide-modified lcat to cholesterol occurred, indicating that the fatty-acylated serine residue cannot directly esterify cholesterol. cholesterol arachidonate was formed upon incubation of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-modified lcat with arachidonyl-coa.
pollination, wounding and jasmonate treatments induce the expression of a developmentally regulated pistil dioxygenase at a distance, in the ovary, in the wild potato solanum chacoense bitt. a heterologous cdna probe from petunia hybrida was used to isolate flavanone-3 beta-hydroxylase-encoding cdna clones from carnation (dianthus caryophyllus), china aster (callistephus chinensis) and stock (matthiola incana). the deduced protein sequences together with the known sequences of the enzyme from p. hybrida, barley (hordeum vulgare) and snapdragon (antirrhinum majus) enabled the determination of a consensus sequence which revealed an overall 84% similarity (53% identity) of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases from the different sources. alignment with the sequences of other known enzymes of the same class and to related non-heme iron-(ii) enzymes demonstrated the strict genetic conservation of 14 amino acids, in particular, of three histidines and an aspartic acid. the conservation of the histidine motifs provides strong support for the possible conservation of structurally similar iron-binding sites in these enzymes. the putative role of histidines as chelators of ferrous ions in the active site of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases was corroborated by diethyl-pyrocarbonate modification of the partially purified recombinant petunia enzyme.
wheelchair propulsion biomechanics in junior basketball players: a method for the evaluation of the efficacy of a specific training program magnetic and inertial measurement units are an emerging technology to obtain 3d orientation of body segments in human movement analysis. in this respect, sensor fusion is used to limit the drift errors resulting from the gyroscope data integration by exploiting accelerometer and magnetic aiding sensors. the present study aims at investigating the effectiveness of sensor fusion methods under different experimental conditions. manual and locomotion tasks, differing in time duration, measurement volume, presence/absence of static phases, and out-of-plane movements, were performed by six subjects, and recorded by one unit located on the forearm or the lower trunk, respectively. two sensor fusion methods, representative of the stochastic (extended kalman filter) and complementary (non-linear observer) filtering, were selected, and their accuracy was assessed in terms of attitude (pitch and roll angles) and heading (yaw angle) errors using stereophotogrammetric data as a reference. the sensor fusion approaches provided significantly more accurate results than gyroscope data integration. accuracy improved mostly for heading and when the movement exhibited stationary phases, evenly distributed 3d rotations, it occurred in a small volume, and its duration was greater than approximately 20 s. these results were independent from the specific sensor fusion method used. practice guidelines for improving the outcome accuracy are provided.
family history of suicide and personality two orthogonal personality traits or predispositions, impulsiveness and anxiety, have been invariant in five separate factor analyses. one of these analyses is presented here along with an item analysis of the barratt impulsiveness scale (bis) which has a high loading on the impulsiveness factor. the bis has never significantly correlated with any of the various anxiety or emotional stability measures in over 50 administrations of the scale, further evidence for the invariance of these two second-order factors.
genitourinary health of sexually abused girls and boys: a matched‐cohort study purpose to estimate the likelihood that a recent cohort of children would be exposed to sexual abuse and sexual assault by age 17 in the united states.   methods this analysis draws on three very similarly designed national telephone surveys of youth in 2003, 2008, and 2011, resulting in a pooled sample of 708 17-year-olds, 781 15-year-olds, and 804 16-year-olds.   results the lifetime experience of 17-year-olds with sexual abuse and sexual assault was 26.6% (95% confidence interval [ci] 19.8-33.5) for girls and 5.1% (95% ci 2.6-7.6) for boys. the lifetime experience with sexual abuse and sexual assault at the hands of adult perpetrators exclusively was 11.2% (95% ci 6.4-16.1) for females and 1.9% (95% ci .5-3.4) for males. for females, considerable risk for sexual abuse and assault was concentrated in late adolescence, as the rate rose from 16.8% (95% ci 11.5-22.2) for 15-year-old females to 26.6% (95% ci 19.8-33.5) for 17-year-old females. for males, it rose from 4.3% (95% ci 1.9-6.8) at 15 years to 5.1% (2.6-7.6) at 17 years.   conclusions self-report surveys in late adolescence reveal high rates of lifetime experience with sexual abuse and sexual assault at the hands of both adults and peers. because of high continuing victimization during the late teen years, assessments are most complete when conducted among the oldest youth.
discrimination and perception of the acoustic rendition of texts by blind people in this paper we present the design and development of a modular and scalable speech composer named demosthenes. it has been designed for converting plain or formatted text (e.g. hmtl) to a combination of speech and audio signals. demosthenes' architecture constitutes an extension to current text-to-speech systems’ structure that enables an open set of module-defined functions to interact with the under processing text at any stage of the text-tospeech conversion. details on its implementation are given here. furthermore, we present some techniques for text handling and prosody generation using demosthenes.
remodelling of human atrial k+ currents but not ion channel expression by chronic β-blockade objective to investigate changes in human atrial single cell functional electrophysiological properties associated with chronic atrial fibrillation (af), and the contribution to these of accompanying ion current changes.   methods the whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record action potentials, the effective refractory period (erp) and ion currents, in the absence and presence of drugs, in enzymatically isolated myocytes from 11 patients with chronic (>6 months) af and 39 patients in sinus rhythm.   results stimulation at high rates (up to 600 beats/min) markedly shortened late repolarisation and the erp in cells from patients in sinus rhythm, and depolarised the maximum diastolic potential (mdp). chronic af was associated with a reduction in the erp at physiological rate (from 203+/-16 to 104+/-15 ms, p<0.05), and marked attenuation in rate effects on the erp and repolarisation. the abbreviated terminal phase of repolarisation prevented fast rate-induced depolarisation of the mdp in cells from patients with af. the density of l-type ca(2+) (i(cal)) and transient outward k(+) (i(to)) currents was significantly reduced in cells from patients with af (by 60-65%), whilst the inward rectifier k(+) current (i(k1)) was increased, and the sustained outward current (i(ksus)) was unaltered. superfusion of cells from patients in sinus rhythm with nifedipine (10 micromol/l) moderately shortened repolarisation, but had no effect on the erp (228+/-12 vs. 225+/-11 ms). 4-aminopyridine (2 mmol/l) markedly prolonged repolarisation and the erp (by 35%, p<0.05). however, the combination of these drugs had no effect on late repolarisation or refractoriness.   conclusion chronic af in humans is associated with attenuation in adaptation of the atrial single cell erp and mdp to fast rates, which may not be explained fully by accompanying changes in i(cal) and i(to).
effect of single-dose dexmedetomidine on postoperative recovery after ambulatory ureteroscopy and ureteric stenting: a double blind randomized controlled study alphaxalone-alphadolone (althesin), diluted and administered as a controlled infusion, was used as a sedative for 30 patients in an intensive therapy unit. this technique allowed rapid and accurate control of the level of sedation. it had three particularly useful applications: it provided “light sleep,” allowed rapid variation in the level of sedation, and enabled repeated assessment of the central nervous system. sedation was satisfactory for 86% of the total time, and no serious complications were attributed to the use of the drug. furthermore, though alphaxalone-alphadolone was given for periods up to 20 days there was no evidence of tachyphylaxis or delay in recovery time.
process evaluation results from the healthy physical education intervention. the healthy primary prevention trial was designed and implemented in response to the growing numbers of children and adolescents being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. the objective was to moderate risk factors for type 2 diabetes. modifiable risk factors measured were indicators of adiposity and glycemic dysregulation: body mass index ⩾85th percentile, fasting glucose ⩾5.55 mmol l−1 (100 mg per 100 ml) and fasting insulin ⩾180 pmol l−1 (30 μu ml−1). a series of pilot studies established the feasibility of performing data collection procedures and tested the development of an intervention consisting of four integrated components: (1) changes in the quantity and nutritional quality of food and beverage offerings throughout the total school food environment; (2) physical education class lesson plans and accompanying equipment to increase both participation and number of minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; (3) brief classroom activities and family outreach vehicles to increase knowledge, enhance decision-making skills and support and reinforce youth in accomplishing goals; and (4) communications and social marketing strategies to enhance and promote changes through messages, images, events and activities. expert study staff provided training, assistance, materials and guidance for school faculty and staff to implement the intervention components. a cohort of students were enrolled in sixth grade and followed to end of eighth grade. they attended a health screening data collection at baseline and end of study that involved measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and a fasting blood draw. height and weight were also collected at the end of the seventh grade. the study was conducted in 42 middle schools, six at each of seven locations across the country, with 21 schools randomized to receive the intervention and 21 to act as controls (data collection activities only). middle school was the unit of sample size and power computation, randomization, intervention and primary analysis.
α-hydroxybutyrate is an early biomarker of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in a nondiabetic population to address the challenges associated with metabolomics analyses, such as identification of chemical structures and elimination of experimental artifacts, we developed a platform that integrated the chemical analysis, including identification and relative quantification, data reduction, and quality assurance components of the process. the analytical platform incorporated two separate ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (uhplc/ms/ms(2)) injections; one injection was optimized for basic species, and the other was optimized for acidic species. this approach permitted the detection of 339 small molecules, a total instrument analysis time of 24 min (two injections at 12 min each), while maintaining a median process variability of 9%. the resulting ms/ms(2) data were searched against an in-house generated authentic standard library that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as their associated ms/ms spectra for all molecules in the library. the library allowed the rapid and high-confidence identification of the experimentally detected molecules based on a multiparameter match without need for additional analyses. this integrated platform enabled the high-throughput collection and relative quantitative analysis of analytical data and identified a large number and broad spectrum of molecules with a high degree of confidence.
hsp72 inhibits apoptosis-inducing factor release in atp-depleted renal epithelial cells. the events that precipitate cell death and the stress proteins responsible for cytoprotection during atp depletion remain elusive. we hypothesize that exposure to metabolic inhibitors damages mitochondria, allowing proapoptotic proteins to leak into the cytosol, and suggest that heat stress-induced hsp72 accumulation prevents mitochondrial membrane injury. to test these hypotheses, renal epithelial cells were transiently atp depleted with sodium cyanide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose in the absence of medium dextrose. recovery from atp depletion was associated with the release into the cytosol of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (aif), proapoptotic proteins that localize to the intermitochondrial membrane space. concomitant with mitochondrial cytochrome c leak, a seven- to eightfold increase in caspase 3 activity was observed. in controls, state iii mitochondrial respiration was reduced by 30% after transient exposure to metabolic inhibitors. prior heat stress preserved mitochondrial atp production and significantly reduced both cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. despite less cytochrome c release, prior heat stress increased binding between cytochrome c and hsp72. the present study demonstrates that mitochondrial injury accompanies exposure to metabolic inhibitors. by reducing outer mitochondrial membrane injury and by complexing with cytochrome c, hsp72 could inhibit caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis.
regulatory expression of genes related to metastasis by tgf-β and activin a in b16 murine melanoma cells smad transcription factors lie at the core of one of the most versatile cytokine signaling pathways in metazoan biology-the transforming growth factor-beta (tgfbeta) pathway. recent progress has shed light into the processes of smad activation and deactivation, nucleocytoplasmic dynamics, and assembly of transcriptional complexes. a rich repertoire of regulatory devices exerts control over each step of the smad pathway. this knowledge is enabling work on more complex questions about the organization, integration, and modulation of smad-dependent transcriptional programs. we are beginning to uncover self-enabled gene response cascades, graded smad response mechanisms, and smad-dependent synexpression groups. our growing understanding of tgfbeta signaling through the smad pathway provides general principles for how animal cells translate complex inputs into concrete behavior.
cross-sectional area of the lumbar back muscles as a function of torso flexion. the attachments and orientation of every fascicle of the lumbar erector spinae were determined in five cadavers and recorded radiographically. little variation was found in the sites of muscle attachment, which enabled the construction of maps whereby these sites could be plotted on clinical radiographs or models of the lumbar spine. when all fascicles were plotted on 21 clinical radiographs using the maps previously developed, no significant difference in the orientation of fascicles was found compared with that observed in cadavers. this result vindicates the technique used to plot the location of individual fascicles of the lumbar back muscles.
testing matrix function algorithms using identities an algorithm for computing matrix functions is presented. it employs a schur decomposition with reordering and blocking followed by the block form of a recurrence of parlett, with functions of the nontrivial diagonal blocks evaluated via a taylor series. a parameter is used to balance the conflicting requirements of producing small diagonal blocks and keeping the separations of the blocks large. the algorithm is intended primarily for functions having a taylor series with an infinite radius of convergence, but it can be adapted for certain other functions, such as the logarithm. novel features introduced here include a convergence test that avoids premature termination of the taylor series evaluation and an algorithm for reordering and blocking the schur form. numerical experiments show that the algorithm is competitive with existing special-purpose algorithms for the matrix exponential, logarithm, and cosine. nevertheless, the algorithm can be numerically unstable with the default choice of its blocking parameter (or in certain cases for all choices), and we explain why determining the optimal parameter appears to be a very difficult problem. a matlab implementation is available that is much more reliable than the function funm in matlab 6.5 (r13).
variability among cucurbitaceae species (melon, cucumber and watermelon) in a genomic region containing a cluster of nbs-lrr genes mcscan is an algorithm able to scan multiple genomes or subgenomes in order to identify putative homologous chromosomal regions, and align these regions using genes as anchors. the mcscanx toolkit implements an adjusted mcscan algorithm for detection of synteny and collinearity that extends the original software by incorporating 14 utility programs for visualization of results and additional downstream analyses. applications of mcscanx to several sequenced plant genomes and gene families are shown as examples. mcscanx can be used to effectively analyze chromosome structural changes, and reveal the history of gene family expansions that might contribute to the adaptation of lineages and taxa. an integrated view of various modes of gene duplication can supplement the traditional gene tree analysis in specific families. the source code and documentation of mcscanx are freely available at http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/.
polarized secretion of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by retinal pigment epithelium derived from induced pluripotent stem cells during wound healing. pluripotent stem cells possess the ability to proliferate indefinitely and to differentiate into almost any cell type. additionally, the development of techniques to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells has generated interest and excitement towards the possibility of customized personal regenerative medicine. however, the efficiency of stem cell differentiation towards a desired lineage remains low. the purpose of this study is to describe a protocol to derive retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) from ips cells (ips-rpe) by applying a tissue engineering approach to generate homogenous populations of embryoid bodies (ebs), a common intermediate during in vitro differentiation. the protocol applies the formation of specific size of ebs using microwell plate technology. the methods for identifying protein and gene markers of rpe by immunocytochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) are also explained. finally, the efficiency of differentiation in different sizes of ebs monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) analysis of rpe markers is described. these techniques will facilitate the differentiation of ips cells into rpe for future applications.
putative ephx1 enzyme activity is related with risk of lung and upper aerodigestive tract cancers: a comprehensive meta-analysis exposure to aflatoxins is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). aflatoxins occur in peanut butter and are metabolized by genetically polymorphic enzymes such as glutathione-s-transferases encoded by glutathione-s-transferase mu 1 gene (gstm1) and glutathione-s-transferase theta 1 gene (gstt1) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase encoded by epoxide hydrolase gene (ephx). the rate at which aflatoxins become activated or detoxified may depend on polymorphisms in the encoding genes. gstm1 homozygous deletion was indeed found to modify the association between peanut butter consumption and hcc. in this study, we investigate possible roles of gstt1 and ephx polymorphisms in this relationship. from a sudanese case-control study on hcc, we analyzed data of 112 incident cases and 194 controls. all participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire inquiring about social and demographic factors, peanut butter consumption, and other known hcc risk factors. univariate analysis showed that gstt1 polymorphism was not associated with hcc, whereas ephx 113hh and 139hh genotypes increased the risk of hcc (odds ratio, 3.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-8.12). adjustment for age and region of origin slightly attenuated this association (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-7.95). interestingly, unlike gstm1, both gstt1 and ephx polymorphism did not modify the association between peanut butter consumption and hcc. in conclusion, these epidemiological findings do not suggest significant roles of gstt1 and ephx in aflatoxin metabolism, although ephx polymorphism is possibly related to the increased risk of hcc. further studies are needed to investigate mechanisms by which the ephx polymorphism potentially modifies cancer risk.
pvac-seq: a genome-guided in silico approach to identifying tumor neoantigens the human leukocyte antigen (hla) is key to many aspects of human physiology and medicine. all current sequence-based hla typing methodologies are targeted approaches requiring the amplification of specific hla gene segments. whole genome, exome and transcriptome shotgun sequencing can generate prodigious data but due to the complexity of hla loci these data have not been immediately informative regarding hla genotype. we describe hlaminer, a computational method for identifying hla alleles directly from shotgun sequence datasets (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/hlaminer). this approach circumvents the additional time and cost of generating hla-specific data and capitalizes on the increasing accessibility and affordability of massively parallel sequencing.
weighted fair share scheduling for loosely controlled concurrent event systems in this paper, we present an approach for qos management that can be applied to a general class of real-time distributed computation systems. in the proposed approach, a switching hybrid system model is used to represent the system. in this setting, the qos specifications are transformed into set-point specifications and a limited-horizon online supervisory controller is used to move the system to the optimal operation point.
protein structural model selection by combining consensus and single scoring methods for a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. we have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern‐recognition process of hydrogen‐bonded and geometrical features extracted from x‐ray coordinates. cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen‐bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive cα positions and is positive for right‐handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β‐sheets. curved pieces are defined as “bends.” solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. the end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including ss bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. the presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. the dictionary is also available in computer‐readable form for protein structure prediction work.

the representational geometry of word meanings acquired by neural machine translation models we propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. this versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. this work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.

network topology-based detection of differential gene regulation and regulatory switches in cell metabolism and signaling metabolism is a vital cellular process, and its malfunction is a major contributor to human disease. metabolic networks are complex and highly interconnected, and thus systems-level computational approaches are required to elucidate and understand metabolic genotype–phenotype relationships. we have manually reconstructed the global human metabolic network based on build 35 of the genome annotation and a comprehensive evaluation of >50 years of legacy data (i.e., bibliomic data). herein we describe the reconstruction process and demonstrate how the resulting genome-scale (or global) network can be used (i) for the discovery of missing information, (ii) for the formulation of an in silico model, and (iii) as a structured context for analyzing high-throughput biological data sets. our comprehensive evaluation of the literature revealed many gaps in the current understanding of human metabolism that require future experimental investigation. mathematical analysis of network structure elucidated the implications of intracellular compartmentalization and the potential use of correlated reaction sets for alternative drug target identification. integrated analysis of high-throughput data sets within the context of the reconstruction enabled a global assessment of functional metabolic states. these results highlight some of the applications enabled by the reconstructed human metabolic network. the establishment of this network represents an important step toward genome-scale human systems biology.
determinants of accelerated small intestinal transit in alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis background: the pattern of progression of a meal from the stomach to the caecum in diabetes mellitus is controversial and the differential roles of transit through the jejunum and the ileum have not been investigated in diabetes. aims: to determine gastric emptying and transit rates through proximal and distal regions of the small bowel in type i diabetic patients. subjects: the study included six diabetic patients with evidence of autonomic neuropathy (dm-an group), 11 diabetics without autonomic dysfunction (dm group), and 15 control volunteers. methods: gastric emptying and small bowel transit of a liquid meal were evaluated scintigraphically in these subjects. transit through regions of interest corresponding to the proximal and distal small intestine up to the caecum was determined and correlated with gastric emptying rates, cardiovascular measurements of autonomic function, and the occurrence of diarrhoea. results: gastric emptying and transit through the proximal small bowel were similar in the three groups. the meal arrived to the caecum significantly earlier in dm-an patients (median; range: 55 min; 22-->180 min) than in the dm group (100 min; 44-->180 min, p < 0.05) or in controls (120 min; 80-->180 min, p < 0.02). accumulation of chyme in the distal small bowel was decreased in dm-an patients, who showed values for peak activity (30%; 10-55%) significantly lower than in the dm group (49%; 25-77%, p = 0.02) and controls (50%; 30-81%, p = 0.02). in dm patients (n = 17), the time of meal arrival to the caecum was significantly correlated with both orthostatic hypotension (coefficient of contingency, c = 0.53, p < 0.01) and diarrhoea (c = 0.47, p < 0.05), but not with gastric emptying rates. conclusions: patients with type i diabetes mellitus and sympathetic denervation have abnormally rapid transit of a liquid meal through the distal small bowel, which may play a part in diarrhoea production.
potential range of the invasive fish rotan (perccottus glenii) in the holarctic determining the spread and potential geographical distribution of invasive species is integral to making invasion biology a predictive science. we assembled a dataset of over 1000 occurrences of the argentine ant (linepithema humile), one of the world's worst invasive alien species. native to central south america, argentine ants are now found in many mediterranean and subtropical climates around the world. we used this dataset to assess the species' potential geographical and ecological distribution, and to examine changes in its distributional potential associated with global climate change, using techniques for ecological niche modelling. models developed were highly predictive of the species' overall range, including both the native distributional area and invaded areas worldwide. despite its already widespread occurrence, l. humile has potential for further spread, with tropical coastal africa and southeast asia apparently vulnerable to invasion. projecting ecological niche models onto four general circulation model scenarios of future (2050s) climates provided scenarios of the species' potential for distributional expansion with warming climates: generally, the species was predicted to retract its range in tropical regions, but to expand at higher latitude areas.
mono and dual species biofilm formation between lactobacillus pentosus and pichia membranifaciens on the surface of black olives under different sterile brine conditions this work examines the formation of poly-microbial communities adhered to the surface of manzanilla olive fruits processed according to the spanish style. the experimental design consisted of four pilot fermenters inoculated with four lactobacillus pentosus strains, plus another fermenter which was not inoculated and fermented spontaneously. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were analysed in depth on olive epidermis throughout fermentation by plate count, molecular techniques and scanning electron microscopy. data show that in all cases high population levels (above 8 log(10) cfu per olive) were reached for both groups of microorganisms at the second week of fermentation and that these counts never fell below 6 log(10) cfu per olive during the 3 months that fermenters were monitored. in situ observation of olive epidermis slices revealed a strong aggregation and adhesion between bacteria and yeasts by the formation of a matrix which embedded the microorganisms. geotrichum candidum, pichia galeiformis and candida sorbosa were the main yeast species isolated from these biofilms at the end of fermentation (confirmed by rflp analysis of the 5.8s-its region), while molecular characterization of lactobacilli isolates by means of rapd-pcr with primer opl(5) showed in many cases a high similarity in their banding profiles with the inoculated strains. results obtained in this survey show the importance of studying the olive epidermis throughout fermentation, because ultimately, olives are ingested by consumers.
opposing effects of 5,7-dht lesions to the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens on the processing of irrelevant stimuli the roles of norepinephrine (ne) and serotonin (5-ht) were assessed by comparing the effect of their depletion on the associability of stimuli. ne and 5-ht depleted rats and vehicle controls were assigned to two training conditions and to a control condition. in each of the training conditions rats were pre-exposed to a single stimulus prior to conditioning to a compound stimulus formed from the pre-exposed cue and a new stimulus. the training conditions differed only in the order of testing of each of the stimuli following training. rats assigned to the control condition received only compound conditioning before the associability of each cue was assessed. the findings show that: (a) vehicle rats in the training tasks evidence superconditioning: the associative strength of the new element exceeds that of the pre-exposed cue; (b) equivalent associative strength was found with either cue regardless of their testing order for ne depleted rats; and (c) 5-ht depleted rats did not show superconditioning: the pre-exposed cue competes with the new cue for available associative strength.
evidence for coral range expansion accompanied by reduced diversity of symbiodinium genotypes a protocol that takes advantage of length heteroplasmy in domain v of chloroplast large subunit (cp23s)–ribosomal dna to identify members of the symbiotic dinoflagellate genus symbiodinium is presented. this protocol is highly specific for symbiodinium, can provide intercladal and intracladal identification of a particular symbiodinium isolate, and can detect multiple symbiodinium chloroplast genotypes simultaneously in the same isolate, making his technique attractive for a variety of research questions. we used this technique to characterize variation among symbiodinium populations associated with a range of phylogenetically diverse and geographically discrete hosts. we also examined symbiont variation within a single host, the caribbean gorgonian pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, from 9 sites in the bahamas, and we report a previously undocumented level of symbiont specificity for particular members of symbiodinium clade b in this gorgonian.
effects of age and inactivity due to prolonged bed rest on atrophy of trunk muscles study design within-session intrarater and interrater reliability study.   objective to establish the intrarater and interrater reliability of thickness measurements of the multifidus muscle in a parasagittal plane, conducted by an experienced ultrasound operator and a novice assessor.   background there is considerable evidence for the important role of the multifidus muscle in segmental stabilization of the lumbar spine. the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle has been assessed in healthy subjects and patients with low back pain using real-time ultrasound imaging. however, few studies have measured the thickness of the multifidus muscle using a parasagittal view.   methods and measures the thickness of the multifidus muscle was measured at rest, using real-time ultrasound imaging, in 10 subjects without a history of low back pain, at the levels of the l2-3 and l4-5 zygapophyseal joints. the measure was carried out 3 times at each level by 2 assessors (1 experienced, 1 novice). intrarater (model 3) and interrater (model 2) reliability was assessed by calculation of an f statistic (analysis of variance), the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc), and the standard error of measurement (sem).   results on the basis of an average of 3 trials, the 2 operators showed very high interrater agreement on the measurement of thicknesses at the l2-3 level (icc2,3 = 0.96; 95% ci: 0.84 to 0.99) and the l4-5 vertebral level (icc2,3 = 0.97; 95% ci: 0.87 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across operators (p > .05). interrater reliability was relatively lower for the l2-3 level (icc2,1 = 0.85; 95% ci: 0.51 to 0.96) than the l4-5 level (icc2,1 = 0.87; 95% ci: 0.52 to 0.97) when a single trial per rater was used, but these values still indicated a high level of agreement. in addition, the novice and experienced operator produced reliable intrarater measurements at l2-3 (icc3,1 = 0.89; 95% ci: 0.72 to 0.97 and 0.94; 95% ci: 0.86 to 0.99) and at l4-5 (icc3,1 = 0.88; 95% ci: 0.68 to 0.97 and 0.95; 95% ci: 0.86 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across trials (p > .05). the consistently low sem values also indicate low measurement error.   conclusion a novice and an experienced assessor were both able to reliably perform this measure at rest for 2 vertebral levels using real-time ultrasound imaging. an average of 3 trials produced higher interrater reliability scores, though using a single trial per rater was also reliable.

developmental changes in sleep spindle characteristics and sigma power across early childhood during the first international eeg congress, london in 1947, it was recommended that dr. herbert h. jasper study methods to standardize the placement of electrodes used in eeg (jasper 1958). a report with recommendations was to be presented to the second international congress in paris in 1949. the electrode placement systems in use at various centers were found to be similar, with only minor differences, although their designations, letters and numbers were entirely different. dr. jasper established some guidelines which would be established in recommending a speci®c system to the federation and these are listed below.
comparison of four modeling tools for the prediction of potential distribution for non-indigenous weeds in the united states the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis (cfsr) was completed for the 31-yr period from 1979 to 2009, in january 2010. the cfsr was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution coupled atmosphere–ocean–land surface–sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. the current cfsr will be extended as an operational, real-time product into the future. new features of the cfsr include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field, 2) an interactive sea ice model, and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the gridpoint statistical interpolation (gsi) scheme over the entire period. the cfsr global atmosphere resolution is ~38 km (t382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hpa. the global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25° at the equator, extending to a global 0.5° beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737 m. the global land surface model has four soil levels and the global sea ice m...
a restful interface to annotations on the web rdf, the core data format for the semantic web, is increasingly being deployed both from automated sources and via human authoring either directly or through tools that generate rdf output. as individuals build up large amounts of rdf data and as groups begin to collaborate on authoring knowledge stores in rdf, the need for some kind of version management becomes apparent. while there are many version control systems available for program source code and even for xml data, the use of version control for rdf data is not a widely explored area. this paper examines an existing version control system for program source code, darcs, which is grounded in a semi-formal theory of patches, and proposes an adaptation to directly manage versions of an rdf triple store.
associations between enterotoxin gene cluster types egc1, egc2 and egc3, agr types, enterotoxin and enterotoxin-like gene profiles, and molecular typing characteristics of human nasal carriage and animal isolates of staphylococcus aureus. staphylococcus aureus isolates from cows in ireland (n = 102) and the usa (n = 42) were characterized by rapd‐pcr and analysed for the production of a number of putative virulence factors. of these strains 63 representative isolates were screened for the corresponding virulence factor genes by pcr or southern hybridization or both. the isolates were divided into 12 distinct clonal types on the basis of their rapd fingerprint profiles. of the isolates, 107 (74·3%) tested positive for clumping factor in a slide agglutination test, all 24 rapd type 7 isolates being negative for clumping factor. pcr analysis of region r, a repeat region of the clfa gene, revealed eight region‐r sizes. there was a strong association between rapd type and the clfa region‐r genotype among irish isolates. of the rapd type 7 isolates, 21 (87·5%) coproduced toxic shock syndrome toxin‐1 (tsst‐1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin c (sec). over 90% of isolates demonstrated haemolytic activity on sheep or rabbit red blood cells and all isolates harboured the gamma‐haemolysin (hlg) locus. of the irish isolates, all those of rapd type 7 were sensitive to penicillin g, whereas 86% of rapd types 4 and 5 strains were resistant. furthermore, rapd types 5 and 7 were more likely to be associated with clinical mastitis whereas rapd type 4 isolates were more often associated with a latent infection. the current study identifies some of the putative virulence factors produced by the predominant clonal types of bovine staph. aureus that may be considered as components of a vaccine.
experimental demonstration of non-binary ldpc coded modulation for ultra-long-haul transmission systems we propose a maximum a posteriori probability (map) turbo equalizer based on the sliding-window multilevel bahl-cocke-jelinek-raviv algorithm. this scheme is suitable for simultaneous nonlinear and linear impairment mitigation in multilevel coded-modulation schemes with coherent detection. the proposed scheme employs large-girth quasicyclic ldpc codes as channel codes. we demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with fiber nonlinearities by performing monte carlo simulations. in addition, we provide the experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with polarization mode dispersion. we also study the ultimate channel capacity limits, assuming an independent identically distributed source.
variability of erythrocyte and serum lithium levels correlates with therapist treatment adherence efforts and maintenance treatment outcome background the effectiveness of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) in tricyclic resistant depression has received surprisingly little systematic study.   method patients who failed to respond to sustained, adequate treatment with the tricyclic imipramine (mean maximum dosage = 260 mg/day) and interpersonal psychotherapy were withdrawn from imipramine and treated in a standardized, but open-label 6-week trial with either phenelzine (n = 4; 60 mg/day) or tranylcypromine (n = 36; mean = 38.5 mg/day) and continued interpersonal psychotherapy.   results forty of 42 patients (95%) completed the trial, of whom 23 (58%) responded to treatment. highly significant improvement was documented on measures of depression, reversed neurovegetative symptoms, and somatic symptoms. response was significantly correlated with severity of depression (pre-maoi score on the hamilton rating scale for depression), severity of a composite score of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features, and low levels of improvement during initial imipramine/interpersonal psychotherapy. of patients who met criteria for proposed subforms of anergic or atypical depression, 67% (18/27) responded (p less than .05); 77% (17/22) of patients who scored above the mean on the composite measure of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features responded (p less than .01).   conclusion these findings provide strong evidence of the utility of maois in tricyclic-resistant depression, especially in patients with features such as fatigue, volitional inhibition, motoric retardation, hypersomnia, and/or weight gain.
a digital library effort to support the building of grammatical resources for italian dialects this paper examines the current way of keeping the data produced during the evaluation campaigns and highlights some shortenings of it. as a consequence, we propose a new approach for improving the management evaluation campaigns' data. in this approach, the data are considered as scientific data to be cured and enriched in order to give full support to longitudinal statistical studies and long-term preservation.
compact aspect embedding for diversified query expansions diversified query expansion aims to cover different possible intents of a short and ambiguous query. most standard approaches use a single source of information, e.g., the initial retrieval list or some external resource like conceptnet. the coverage is thus limited by that of the resource. to alleviate this issue, we propose the use of multiple resources. more specifically, our framework first automatically generates a list of diversified queries for each resource, and then combines the retrieved documents for all the expanded queries following the maximal marginal relevance principal. we evaluate our framework on several trec data sets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of incorporating different resources for diversified query expansion.
vitamin a transporting proteins in human epidermis and blister fluids in fetal life the development of bullous pemphigoid antigen is preceded by a morphologically detectable basement membrane zone (bmz). the present study investigated the possibility that similar morphologic and antigenic changes of the bmz occur in short term organ culture of human skin. twenty small pieces from each of four neonatal foreskin specimens were cultured under standard conditions. at regular intervals two pieces from each specimen were removed. one piece was frozen and cryostat sections were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using a patient's serum that was proven to have circulating pemphigoid igg antibodies. additional sections were stained with periodic acid-schiff and hematoxylin and eosin. the other piece was processed for electron microscopic examination. morphologically the bmz started degenerating after 24 hours. regeneration started on the 4th day and reached an optimal level on the 5th day. chance of the immunofluorescence line at the bmz began with a slight weakening at 24 hours followed by progressive widening and breakage until the 4th day when fluorescence was no longer detectable. except for a few punctate areas immunofluorescence remained absent on the 5th day. sixth day specimens, however, revealed reappearance of the immunofluorescence line in a continuous pattern. by the 7th day a second morphologic and antigenic degeneration started at the bmz. this lag between the morphologic and antigenic regeneration of the bmz in organ culture although shorter is comparable to the one observed during the development of the bmz in fetal life.
a hybrid feature model for seam carving detection presents a theoretically very simple, yet efficient, multiresolution approach to gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local binary patterns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions. the method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed "uniform," are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. we derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the "uniform" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. the proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns.
clinical and virological features of dengue in vietnamese infants the pathogenesis of dengue in infants is poorly understood. we postulated that dengue severity in infants would be positively associated with markers of viral burden and that maternally derived, neutralizing anti-dengue antibody would have decayed before the age at which infants with dengue presented to the hospital. in 75 vietnamese infants with primary dengue, we found significant heterogeneity in viremia and ns1 antigenemia at hospital presentation, and these factors were independent of disease grade or continuous measures of disease severity. neutralizing antibody titers, predicted in each infant at the time of their illness, suggested that the majority of infants (65%) experienced dengue hemorrhagic fever when the maternally derived neutralizing antibody titer had declined to <1 : 20. collectively, these data have important implications for dengue vaccine research because they suggest that viral burden may not solely explain severe dengue in infants and that neutralizing antibody is a reasonable but not absolute marker of protective immunity in infants.
manifold identification of dual averaging methods for regularized stochastic online learning convex programming involves a convex set f ⊆ rn and a convex cost function c : f → r. the goal of convex programming is to find a point in f which minimizes c. in online convex programming, the convex set is known in advance, but in each step of some repeated optimization problem, one must select a point in f before seeing the cost function for that step. this can be used to model factory production, farm production, and many other industrial optimization problems where one is unaware of the value of the items produced until they have already been constructed. we introduce an algorithm for this domain. we also apply this algorithm to repeated games, and show that it is really a generalization of infinitesimal gradient ascent, and the results here imply that generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent (giga) is universally consistent.
creb binding protein (cbp) activation is required for luteinizing hormone beta expression and normal fertility in mice hepatic gluconeogenesis is essential for maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations and is regulated by opposing stimulatory (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, camp) and inhibitory (insulin) signaling pathways. the camp signaling pathway leads to phosphorylation of camp response element–binding (creb) protein, resulting in recruitment of the coactivators creb-binding protein (cbp) and p300 and subsequent activation of gluconeogenesis. insulin signaling leads to phosphorylation of cbp at serine 436, a residue near its creb-interacting domain, but it is unknown whether this event modulates camp signaling. here, we show in vitro and in 'knock-in' mice that a mutant cbp (s436a) is aberrantly recruited to creb protein, resulting in inappropriate activation of gluconeogenesis in the fed state and glucose intolerance resulting from increased hepatic glucose production. we propose that insulin signaling may directly regulate many camp signaling pathways at the transcriptional level by controlling cbp recruitment.
sex of experimenter and social norm effects on reports of sexual behavior in young men and women individual differences in willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations were investigated in 6 studies. in study 1, a 5-item sociosexual orientation inventory (soi) was developed. studies 2, 3, and 4 provided convergent validity evidence for the soi, revealing that persons who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation tend to (a) engage in sex at an earlier point in their relationships, (b) engage in sex with more than 1 partner at a time, and (c) be involved in relationships characterized by less investment, commitment, love, and dependency. study 5 provided discriminant validity for the soi, revealing that it does not covary appreciably with a good marker of sex drive. study 6 demonstrated that the soi correlates negligibly with measures of sexual satisfaction, anxiety, and guilt. the possible stability of, origins of, and motivational bases underlying individual differences in sociosexuality are discussed.
clinical potentials of methylator phenotype in stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma: an open challenge purpose because current approaches to risk classification and treatment stratification for children with neuroblastoma (nb) vary greatly throughout the world, it is difficult to directly compare risk-based clinical trials. the international neuroblastoma risk group (inrg) classification system was developed to establish a consensus approach for pretreatment risk stratification.   patients and methods the statistical and clinical significance of 13 potential prognostic factors were analyzed in a cohort of 8,800 children diagnosed with nb between 1990 and 2002 from north america and australia (children's oncology group), europe (international society of pediatric oncology europe neuroblastoma group and german pediatric oncology and hematology group), and japan. survival tree regression analyses using event-free survival (efs) as the primary end point were performed to test the prognostic significance of the 13 factors.   results stage, age, histologic category, grade of tumor differentiation, the status of the mycn oncogene, chromosome 11q status, and dna ploidy were the most highly statistically significant and clinically relevant factors. a new staging system (inrg staging system) based on clinical criteria and tumor imaging was developed for the inrg classification system. the optimal age cutoff was determined to be between 15 and 19 months, and 18 months was selected for the classification system. sixteen pretreatment groups were defined on the basis of clinical criteria and statistically significantly different efs of the cohort stratified by the inrg criteria. patients with 5-year efs more than 85%, more than 75% to < or = 85%, > or = 50% to < or = 75%, or less than 50% were classified as very low risk, low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk, respectively.   conclusion by defining homogenous pretreatment patient cohorts, the inrg classification system will greatly facilitate the comparison of risk-based clinical trials conducted in different regions of the world and the development of international collaborative studies.
determination of fetal malnutrition in preterm newborns fetal malnutrition is a common and potentially serious problem perinatally and for later growth and development. unless sought in the neonate, fetal malnutrition is frequently missed but can be detected readily by a simple clinical examination.
suppression of arabidopsis argonaute 1-mediated slicing , transgene-induced rna silencing , and dna methylation by distinct domains of the cucumber mosaic virus 2 b protein the agrobacterium vacuum infiltration method has made it possible to transform arabidopsis thaliana without plant tissue culture or regeneration. in the present study, this method was evaluated and a substantially modified transformation method was developed. the labor-intensive vacuum infiltration process was eliminated in favor of simple dipping of developing floral tissues into a solution containing agrobacterium tumefaciens, 5% sucrose and 500 microliters per litre of surfactant silwet l-77. sucrose and surfactant were critical to the success of the floral dip method. plants inoculated when numerous immature floral buds and few siliques were present produced transformed progeny at the highest rate. plant tissue culture media, the hormone benzylamino purine and ph adjustment were unnecessary, and agrobacterium could be applied to plants at a range of cell densities. repeated application of agrobacterium improved transformation rates and overall yield of transformants approximately twofold. covering plants for 1 day to retain humidity after inoculation also raised transformation rates twofold. multiple ecotypes were transformable by this method. the modified method should facilitate high-throughput transformation of arabidopsis for efforts such as t-dna gene tagging, positional cloning, or attempts at targeted gene replacement.
self-compassion and risk behavior among people living with hiv/aids. purpose human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) treatment self-efficacy is the confidence held by an individual in her or his ability to follow treatment recommendations, including specific hiv care such as initiating and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (art). the purpose of this study was to explore the potential mediating role of treatment adherence self-efficacy in the relationships between social cognitive theory constructs and self- reported art adherence.   design cross-sectional and descriptive. the study was conducted between 2009 and 2011 and included 1,414 participants who lived in the united states or puerto rico and were taking antiretroviral medications.   methods social cognitive constructs were tested specifically: behaviors (three adherence measures each consisting of one item about adherence at 3-day and 30-day along with the adherence rating scale), cognitive or personal factors (the center for epidemiology studies depression scale to assess for depressive symptoms, the 12-item short form health survey (sf-12) to assess physical functioning, one item about physical condition, one item about comorbidity), environmental influences (the social capital scale, one item about social support), and treatment self-efficacy (hiv adherence self-efficacy scale). analysis included descriptive statistics and regression.   results the average participant was 47 years old, male, and a racial or ethnic minority, had an education of high school or less, had barely adequate or totally inadequate income, did not work, had health insurance, and was living with hiv/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome for 15 years. the model provided support for adherence self-efficacy as a robust predictor of art adherence behavior, serving a partial mediating role between environmental influences and cognitive or personal factors.   conclusions although other factors such as depressive symptoms and lack of social capital impact adherence to art, nurses can focus on increasing treatment self-efficacy through diverse interactional strategies using principles of adult learning and strategies to improve health literacy.   clinical relevance adherence to art reduces the viral load thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality and risk of transmission to uninfected persons. nurses need to use a variety of strategies to increase treatment self-efficacy.
state-dependent microstructural white matter changes in bipolar i depression most patients treated for an episode of unipolar or bipolar major depression are treatment resistant in the sense that the majority do not achieve full remission with the first somatic or psychosocial treatment they receive. little attention has been given to formalizing criteria for evaluating the nature and extent of treatment resistance, even though determining the adequacy and outcome of prior treatment trials is key in clinical decision making about subsequent treatment. furthermore, determining the adequacy of prior treatment is essential since substantial evidence indicates that large numbers of depressed patients are undertreated, resulting in prolonged episodes and the appearance of "pseudoresistance." adequacy of antidepressant treatment trials should be defined in terms of thresholds for the dosage and duration of medication, adherence, and clinical outcome. the antidepressant treatment history form is presented as one method to formalize the evaluation of treatment adequacy and treatment resistance.
changes in perceived attentional function in women following breast cancer surgery the primary purpose of this preliminary research was to describe the psychometric properties of a newly‐developed everyday spatial questionnaire for dementia‐patient version (esqd‐p) in a chinese population. a secondary goal was to assess the relationship between executive functions and wayfinding strategy application. the esqd‐p is a measure for the phenomenon of ‘getting lost behavior’ (glb) reported by early alzheimer's disease sufferers, based on the concept of spatial problem‐solving.
improving post-stroke dysphagia outcomes through a standardized and multidisciplinary protocol: an exploratory cohort study abstractaspiration is an important variable related to increased morbidity, mortality, and cost of care for acute stroke patients. this prospective systematic replication study compared a clinical swallowing examination consisting of six clinical identifiers of aspiration risk, i.e., dysphonia, dysarthria, abnormal gag reflex, abnormal volitional cough, cough after swallow, and voice change after swallow, with an instrumental fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (fees) to determine reliability in identifying aspiration risk following acute stroke. a referred consecutive sample of 49 first-time stroke patients was evaluated within 24 hours poststroke, first with the clinical examination followed immediately by fees. the endoscopist was blinded to results of clinical testing. the clinical examination correctly identified 19 subjects with aspiration risk, when compared with the criterion standard fees, but incorrectly identified 3 patients as having no aspiration risk when they did. the clinical examination incorrectly identified 19 subjects with aspiration risk but determined correctly no aspiration risk in 8 patients who did not exhibit aspiration risk on fees. clinical examination sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 30%; false negative rate = 14%; false positive rate = 70%; positive predictive value = 50%; and negative predictive value = 73%. it was concluded that the clinical examination, when compared with fees, underestimated aspiration risk in patients with aspiration risk and overestimated aspiration risk in patients who did not exhibit aspiration risk. careful consideration of the limitations of clinical testing leads us to believe that a reliable, timely, and cost-effective instrumental swallow evaluation should be available for the majority of patients following acute stroke.
longitudinal and spatial distribution of gp60 subtypes in human cryptosporidiosis cases in ireland. cryptosporidium parvum dna from 175 neonatal calves on 16 farms in eight eastern states in the united states was subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60-kda glycoprotein gene to determinate the parasite genetic diversity. six subtypes of the iia subtype family were found. subtype iiaa15g2r1, which is the predominant c. parvum subtype in calves in many parts of the world, was identified in 77% of the c. parvum dna from calves. several farms had more than one c. parvum subtype and a few calves had infections with mixed subtypes. distribution of subtypes differed geographically. diversity of c. parvum in calves in eastern united states was lower than that previously seen in michigan and southern ontario. the high prevalence of one subtype in calves worldwide and frequent detection of this subtype in humans suggests that parasite fitness probably plays an important role in transmission of cryptosporidiosis among cattle and in zoonotic infections.
reward processing by the opioid system in the brain. the effects of a repeated treatment with nicotine on the expression of mrnas encoding preproenkephalin (ppe), preprotachykinin‐a (ppt‐a), and preprodynorphin (ppdyn) were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry in various subregions of the nucleus accumbens (acb). in saline‐treated rats, optical density measurements on autoradiographic films showed marked anteroposterior decreasing gradients for ppe and ppt‐a mrnas in the rostral pole and the core, in the cone, and in the ventral shell of the acb, whereas a lower anteroposterior gradient was observed for ppdyn mrna signals. the intensity of the three mrna signals also varied according to acb subregion. however, analysis of percentages of prepropeptide mrna‐containing neurons as compared to total neurons showed, in the rostral pole, the core, and the cone, a similar percentage of ppe mrna (around 45%)‐ and ppt‐a mrna (around 40%)‐ expressing neurons. the ventral shell can be distinguished from the other subregions by a lower percentage of ppe mrna (35.8%)‐ and ppt‐a mrna (30.6%)‐expressing neurons. the percentage of ppdyn mrna‐containing neurons, by contrast, was similar (around 37%) in the core, the cone, and the ventral shell. repeated nicotine administration increases the ppe mrna level in the rostral pole and the anterior third of the core without any change in ppt‐a and ppdyn mrna levels in the various acb subregions examined. the ppe mrna increase does not support an effect mediated through an interaction of nicotine with da neurons. the effect could be linked to a nicotine activation of other afferents to the anterior acb and/or to a direct nicotine stimulation of ppe mrna neurons. © 1996 wiley‐liss, inc.
beat tracking with particle filtering algorithms we present a probabilistic generative model for timing deviations in expressive music performance. the structure of the proposed model is equivalent to a switching state space model. the switch variables correspond to discrete note locations as in a musical score. the continuous hidden variables denote the tempo. we formulate two well known music recognition problems, namely tempo tracking and automatic transcription (rhythm quantization) as filtering and maximum a posteriori (map) state estimation tasks. exact computation of posterior features such as the map state is intractable in this model class, so we introduce monte carlo methods for integration and optimization. we compare markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) methods (such as gibbs sampling, simulated annealing and iterative improvement) and sequential monte carlo methods (particle filters). our simulation results suggest better results with sequential methods. the methods can be applied in both online and batch scenarios such as tempo tracking and transcription and are thus potentially useful in a number of music applications such as adaptive automatic accompaniment, score typesetting and music information retrieval.
a three-step approach with adaptive additive magnitude selection for the sharpening of images this paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. the success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. these goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. we define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. a third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. we use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. on specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. with this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. the optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a gaussian-smoothed image. we extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. we present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.
reading embossed capital letters: an fmri study in blind and sighted individuals for functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of the neural substrates of language, the ability to have subjects performing overt verbal responses while in the scanner environment is important for several reasons. most directly, overt responses allow the investigator to measure the accuracy and reaction time of the behavior. one problem, however, is that magnetic resonance gradient noise obscures the audio recordings made of voice responses, making it difficult to discern subject responses and to calculate reaction times. assert (adaptive spectral subtraction for extracting response times), an algorithm for removing mr gradient noise from audio recordings of subject responses, is described here. the signal processing improves intelligibility of the responses and also allows automated extraction of reaction times. the assert-derived response times were comparable to manually measured times with a mean difference of -8.75 ms (standard deviation of difference = 26.2 ms). these results support the use of assert for the purpose of extracting response latencies and scoring overt verbal responses.
title mixture snps effect on phenotype in genome-wide associationstudies abstract a crucial problem in building a multiple regression model is the selection of predictors to include. the main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. this procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. in this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. the computational burden is then alleviated by using the gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. those subsets with higher probability—the promising ones—can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the gibbs sample.
influence of injection site, microvascular pressure and ultrasound variables on microbubble-mediated delivery of microspheres to muscle. background we have previously shown that the application of ultrasound to thin-shelled microbubbles flowing through small microvessels (<7 microm in diameter) produces vessel wall ruptures in vivo. because many intravascular drug- and gene-delivery vehicles are limited by the endothelial barrier, we hypothesized that this phenomenon could be used to deliver drug-bearing vehicles to tissue.   methods and results an exteriorized rat spinotrapezius muscle preparation was used. intravascular fluorescent red blood cells and polymer microspheres (pm) (205 and 503 nm in diameter) were delivered to the interstitium of rat skeletal muscle through microvessel ruptures created by insonifying microbubbles in vivo. on intravital microscopy, mean dispersion areas per rupture for red blood cells, 503-nm pm, and 205-nm pm were 14.5x10(3) microm2, 24. 2x10(3) microm2, and 27.2x10(3) microm2, respectively. pm dispersion areas were significantly larger than the mean dispersion area for red blood cells (p<0.05).   conclusions microvessel ruptures caused by insonification of microbubbles in vivo may provide a minimally invasive means for delivering colloidal particles and engineered red blood cells across the endothelial lining of a targeted tissue region.
effects of the gaba‐uptake blocker nnc‐711 on spontaneous sharp wave–ripple complexes in mouse hippocampal slices cognitive functions go along with complex patterns of distributed activity in neuronal networks, thereby forming assemblies of selected neurons. to support memory processes, such assemblies have to be stabilized and reactivated in a highly reproducible way. the rodent hippocampus provides a well studied model system for network mechanisms underlying spatial memory formation. assemblies of place-encoding cells are repeatedly activated during sleep-associated network states called sharp wave–ripple complexes (spw-rs). behavioral studies suggest that at any time the hippocampus harbors a limited number of different assemblies that are transiently stabilized for memory consolidation. we hypothesized that the corresponding field potentials (sharp wave–ripple complexes) contain a specific signature of the underlying neuronal activity patterns. hence, they should fall into a limited number of different waveforms. application of unbiased sorting algorithms to sharp wave–ripple complexes in mouse hippocampal slices did indeed reveal the reliable recurrence of defined waveforms that were robust over prolonged recording periods. single-unit discharges tended to fire selectively with certain spw-r classes and were coupled above chance level. thus, field spw-rs of different waveforms are directly related to the underlying multicellular activity patterns that recur with high fidelity. this direct relationship between the coordinated activity of distinct groups of neurons and macroscopic electrographic signals may be important for cognition-related physiological studies in humans and behaving animals.
a mixture model for expert finding this paper examines whether the cranfield evaluation methodology is robust to gross violations of the completeness assumption (i.e., the assumption that all relevant documents within a test collection have been identified and are present in the collection). we show that current evaluation measures are not robust to substantially incomplete relevance judgments. a new measure is introduced that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. this finding suggests that substantially larger or dynamic test collections built using current pooling practices should be viable laboratory tools, despite the fact that the relevance information will be incomplete and imperfect.
does evolution cause a domain shift in real-world applications of visual recognition, many factors - such as pose, illumination, or image quality - can cause a significant mismatch between the source domain on which classifiers are trained and the target domain to which those classifiers are applied. as such, the classifiers often perform poorly on the target domain. domain adaptation techniques aim to correct the mismatch. existing approaches have concentrated on learning feature representations that are invariant across domains, and they often do not directly exploit low-dimensional structures that are intrinsic to many vision datasets. in this paper, we propose a new kernel-based method that takes advantage of such structures. our geodesic flow kernel models domain shift by integrating an infinite number of subspaces that characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties from the source to the target domain. our approach is computationally advantageous, automatically inferring important algorithmic parameters without requiring extensive cross-validation or labeled data from either domain. we also introduce a metric that reliably measures the adaptability between a pair of source and target domains. for a given target domain and several source domains, the metric can be used to automatically select the optimal source domain to adapt and avoid less desirable ones. empirical studies on standard datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach over competing methods.
self-informed neural network structure learning despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. first. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. in this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of matlab. using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. we also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.
individual differences in susceptibility to false memory in the deese-roediger-mcdermott paradigm. r. e. smith and r. r. hunt (1998) reported a dramatic reduction in false remembering in a list-learning paradigm by switching from auditory to visual presentation at study. the current authors replicated these modality effects using written recall and visual recognition tests but obtained smaller effects than those in r. e. smith and r. r. hunt's study. in contrast, no modality effect occurred on auditory recognition tests. manipulating study and test modality within-subjects (experiment 2) and between-subjects (experiment 3) yielded similar results. it was also found that subjects frequently judged critical nonstudied words as having been presented in the modality of their corresponding study lists. the authors concluded that subjects could retrieve distinctive information about a study list's presentation modality to reduce false remembering but only did so under certain conditions. the modality effect on false remembering is a function of both encoding and retrieval factors.
male contraceptive efficacy of poly herbal formulation, contracept-tm, composed of aqueous extracts of terminalia chebula fruit and musa balbisiana seed in rat an enzymatic method is described for determination of total serum cholesterol by use of a single aqueous reagent. the method requires no prior treatment of sample and the calibration curve is linear to 600 mg/dl. cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to free cholesterol by cholesterol ester hydrolase (ec 3.1.1.13). the free cholesterol produced is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to cholest-4-en-3-one with the simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide, which oxidatively couples with 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol in the presence of peroxidase to yield a chromogen with maximum absorption at 500 nm. the method is reproducible, and the results correlate well with those obtained by automated liebermann—burchard procedures (aa-2 and sma 12/60) and the method of abell et al. the present method affords better specificity than those previously reported and has excellent precision.
the importance of window length in splice site prediction we describe a novel analytical approach to gene recognition based on cross-species comparison we first undertook a comparison of orthologous genomic look from human and mouse, studying the extent of similarity in the number, size and sequence of exons and introns we then developed an approach for recognizing genes within such orthologous regions, by first aligning the regions using an iterative global alignment system and then identifying genes based on conservation of exonic features at aligned positions in both species the alignment and gene recognition are performed by new programs called glass and rosetta, respectively rosetta performed well at exact identification of coding exons in 117 orthologous pairs tested.
rotated word vector representations and their interpretability recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic, but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque. we analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. the result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. the model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. it also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.
br-signaling kinase1 physically associates with flagellin sensing2 and regulates plant innate immunity in arabidopsis[w] we have identified an arabidopsis mutant that displays enhanced disease resistance (edr2) to the biotrophic powdery mildew pathogen erysiphe cichoracearum. inhibition of fungal growth on edr2 mutant leaves occurred at a late stage of the infection process and coincided with formation of necrotic lesions approximately 5 days after inoculation. double-mutant analysis revealed that edr2-mediated resistance is suppressed by mutations that inhibit salicylic acid (sa)-induced defense signaling, including npr1, pad4 and sid2, demonstrating that edr2-mediated disease resistance is dependent on sa. however, edr2 showed normal responses to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000. edr2 appears to be constitutively transcribed in all tissues and organs and encodes a novel protein, consisting of a putative pleckstrin homology (ph) domain and a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid-transfer (start) domain, and contains an n-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. the ph and start domains are implicated in lipid binding, suggesting that edr2 may provide a link between lipid signaling and activation of programmed cell death mediated by mitochondria.
mitochondrial β-cyanoalanine synthase is essential for root hair formation in arabidopsis thaliana[w] motivation dna microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. the probability that a false identification (type i error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. in this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (fdr) controlling approach. in order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based fdr controlling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the naïve application of the linear step-up procedure in benjamini and hochberg (1995). the procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation.   results comparative simulation analysis shows that all four fdr controlling procedures control the fdr at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. in terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the naïve one. the highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of fdr control.   availability an r program that adjusts p-values using fdr controlling procedures is freely available over the internet at www.math.tau.ac.il/~ybenja.
quality of life measurement in the palliative management of advanced cancer purpose we developed and validated a brief, yet sensitive, 33-item general cancer quality-of-life (ql) measure for evaluating patients receiving cancer treatment, called the functional assessment of cancer therapy (fact) scale.   methods and results the five-phase validation process involved 854 patients with cancer and 15 oncology specialists. the initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer was generated by open-ended interview with patients experienced with the symptoms of cancer and oncology professionals. using preselected criteria, items were reduced to a 38-item general version. factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on 545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 28-item fact-general (fact-g, version 2). in addition to a total score, this version produces subscale scores for physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being, as well as satisfaction with the treatment relationship. coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. the scale's ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance status rating (psr), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity. it has also demonstrated sensitivity to change over time. finally, the validity of measuring separate areas, or dimensions, of ql was supported by the differential responsiveness of subscales when applied to groups known to differ along the dimensions of physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being.   conclusion the fact-g meets or exceeds all requirements for use in oncology clinical trials, including ease of administration, brevity, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to clinical change. selecting it for a clinical trial adds the capability to assess the relative weight of various aspects of ql from the patient's perspective.
generation of lycopene-overproducing strains of the fungus mucor circinelloides reveals important aspects of lycopene formation and accumulation sexual crosses between strains of phycomyces blakesleeanus , involving three auxotrophic and one color marker and yielding a high proportion of zygospore germination, are described. samples of 20-40 germ spores from 311 individual fertile germ sporangia originating from five two-factor and three three-factor crosses were characterized. the results show: (1) absence of any contribution of apogamic nuclei to the progeny, (2) confirmation of burgeff's conjecture that the germ spores of any germ sporangium in most cases derive from one meiosis. in a cross involving two allelic markers the analysis of 175 pooled germ sporangia suggests an intragenic recombination frequency of 0.6%. all other factor combinations tested are unlinked. the bulk of the germ spores are homokaryotic. however, a small portion (4%) are heterokaryotic with respect to mating type.
fine-mapping the wheat snn1 locus conferring sensitivity to the parastagonospora nodorum necrotrophic effector sntox1 using an eight founder multiparent advanced generation inter-cross population high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotyping arrays are a powerful tool for studying genomic patterns of diversity, inferring ancestral relationships between individuals in populations and studying marker–trait associations in mapping experiments. we developed a genotyping array including about 90 000 gene-associated snps and used it to characterize genetic variation in allohexaploid and allotetraploid wheat populations. the array includes a significant fraction of common genome-wide distributed snps that are represented in populations of diverse geographical origin. we used density-based spatial clustering algorithms to enable high-throughput genotype calling in complex data sets obtained for polyploid wheat. we show that these model-free clustering algorithms provide accurate genotype calling in the presence of multiple clusters including clusters with low signal intensity resulting from significant sequence divergence at the target snp site or gene deletions. assays that detect low-intensity clusters can provide insight into the distribution of presence–absence variation (pav) in wheat populations. a total of 46 977 snps from the wheat 90k array were genetically mapped using a combination of eight mapping populations. the developed array and cluster identification algorithms provide an opportunity to infer detailed haplotype structure in polyploid wheat and will serve as an invaluable resource for diversity studies and investigating the genetic basis of trait variation in wheat.
antiplatelet therapy, but not intravenous thrombolytic therapy, is associated with postoperative bleeding complications after decompressive craniectomy for stroke object the object of this study was to describe the rapid closure technique in decompressive craniectomy without duraplasty and its use in a large cohort of consecutive patients.   methods between 1999 and 2008, supratentorial rapid closure decompressive craniectomy (rcdc) was performed 341 times in 318 patients at the authors' institution. cases were stratified as 1) traumatic brain injury, 2) subarachnoid hemorrhage, 3) intracerebral hemorrhage, 4) cerebral infarction, and 5) other. a large bone flap was removed and the dura mater was opened in a stellate fashion. duraplasty was not performed-that is, the dura was not sutured, and a dural substitute was neither sutured in nor layed on. the dura and exposed brain tissue were covered with hemostyptic material (surgicel). surgical time and complications of this procedure including follow-up (> 6 months) were recorded. after 3-6 months cranioplasty was performed, and, again, surgical time and any complications were recorded.   results rapid closure decompressive craniectomy was feasible in all cases. complications included superficial wound healing disturbance (3.5% of procedures), abscess (2.6%) and csf fistula (0.6%); the mean surgical time (± sd) was 69 ± 20 minutes. cranioplasty was performed in 196 cases; the mean interval (± sd) from craniectomy to cranioplasty was 118 ± 40 days. complications of cranioplasty included epidural hematoma (4.1%), abscess (2.6%), wound healing disturbance (6.1%), and csf fistula (1%). compared with the results reported in the literature for decompressive craniectomy with duraplasty followed by cranioplasty, there were no significant differences in the frequency of complications. however, surgical time for rcdc was significantly shorter (69 ± 20 vs 129 ± 43 minutes, p < 0.0001).   conclusions the present analysis of the largest series reported to date reveals that the rapid closure technique is feasible and safe in decompressive craniectomy. the surgical time is significantly shorter without increased complication rates or additional complications. cranioplasty after a rcdc procedure was also feasible, fast, safe and not impaired by the rcdc technique.
characterization of throat microbial flora in smokers with or without copd abstract mothur aims to be a comprehensive software package that allows users to use a single piece of software to analyze community sequence data. it builds upon previous tools to provide a flexible and powerful software package for analyzing sequencing data. as a case study, we used mothur to trim, screen, and align sequences; calculate distances; assign sequences to operational taxonomic units; and describe the α and β diversity of eight marine samples previously characterized by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments. this analysis of more than 222,000 sequences was completed in less than 2 h with a laptop computer.
active, an extensible cataloging platform for automatic indexing of audiovisual content between october 2000 and december 2000, we collected a database of over 40,000 facial images of 68 people. using the cmu (carnegie mellon university) 3d room, we imaged each person across 13 different poses, under 43 different illumination conditions, and with four different expressions. we call this database the cmu pose, illumination and expression (pie) database. in this paper, we describe the imaging hardware, the collection procedure, the organization of the database, several potential uses of the database, and how to obtain the database.
the formation of proximal and distal definitive endoderm populations in culture requires p38 mapk activity transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf beta 1) is shown here to be required for yolk sac haematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation. mice with a targeted mutation in the tgf beta 1 gene were examined to determine the cause of prenatal lethality, which occurs in 50% of homozygous tgf beta 1 null (tgf beta 1-/-) conceptions. 50% of tgf beta 1-/- and 25% of tgf beta 1-+-) conceptions. 50% of tgf beta 1-/- and 25% of tgf beta 1+/- conceptuses were found to die at around 10.5 dpc. the primary defects were restricted to extraembryonic tissues, namely the yolk sac vasculature and haematopoietic system. the embryos per se showed developmental retardation, oedema and necrosis, which were probably secondary to the extraembryonic lesions. the defect in vasculogenesis appeared to affect endothelial differentiation, rather than the initial appearance and outgrowth of endothelial cells. initial differentiation of yolk sac mesoderm to endothelial cells occurred, but defective differentiation resulted in inadequate capillary tube formation, and weak vessels with reduced cellular adhesiveness. defective haematopoiesis resulted in a reduced erythroid cell number within the yolk sac. defective yolk sac vasculogenesis and haematopoiesis were present either together, or in isolation of each other. the phenotypes are consistent with the observation of abundant tgf beta 1 gene expression in both endothelial and haematopoietic precursors. the data indicate that the primary effect of loss of tgf beta 1 function in vivo is not increased haematopoietic or endothelial cell proliferation, which might have been expected by deletion of a negative growth regulator, but defective haematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation.
prevalence and ethnic/racial disparities in the distribution of pediatric injuries in south florida: implications for the development of community prevention programs the injury severity score (5) (iss) is a scalar (single number) measure of anatomic injury, widely used in and an important contribution to trauma research. the iss is the sum of squares of the highest abbreviated injury scale (1-3) (ais) grade in each of the three most severely injured body regions. thus the iss is a summary measure of trauma to single or multiple body regions. per cent mortality for blunt injured patients has been shown to be related to iss (based on ais-76) and patient age (4-6). patients used to establish those relationships were treated in 1961 and 1967-1968. similar relationships for penetrating injuries have not been prepared because, until the 1985 version, the ais provided severity grades for blunt injuries only. the iss is frequently used to assess or compare the injury severity of patient populations (7, 10, 13, 16) and as the anatomic component of trauma patient characterizations used in evaluation of care and quality assurance methods (8). the ais first published in 1971, was developed to classify anatomic injury from motor vehicle-related trauma. it has been revised and broadened in scope in 1976, 1980, and 1985. changes in injury coding, trauma care delivery, and clinical management mandate the updating of relationships between severity measures and mortality from which conclusions regarding patient management or healthcare policy issues may be drawn. the present study uses the most recent ais version (ais-85) to derive relationships between mortality rate and the iss for comtemporary patients with blunt or penetrating injuries and identifies important properties of the iss which should be considered when the measure is used to compare case mix severity in different populations.(author/trrl)
an amino acids mixture attenuates glycemic impairment but not affects adiposity development in rats fed with ages-containing diet soleus muscles isolated from normal rats were incubated to evaluate whether or not leucine promotes glucose uptake under insulin-free conditions, using a labeled 2-deoxyglucose uptake assay. glucose uptake was promoted by 2mm leucine. a metabolite of leucine, alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (alpha-kic), also exhibited a similar stimulatory effect, although this was not as potent as leucine. stimulation of glucose uptake by leucine was completely canceled by pre-treatment with either 10 microm ly294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-kinase), or 6 microm gf109203x, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase c (pkc). no significant change was observed by pre-treatment with 1 microm rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor). these results suggest that leucine stimulates glucose transport in skeletal muscle via pi3-kinase and pkc pathways independently of the mammalian target of mtor. they also suggest that leucine stimulates glucose transport by an insulin-independent mechanism.
life history diversity in klamath river steelhead abstractsteelhead oncorhynchus mykiss from several of the world's rivers display the half-pounder life history, a variant characterized by an amphidromous (and, less often, anadromous) return to freshwater in the year of initial ocean entry. we evaluated factors related to expression of the half-pounder life history in wild steelhead from the lower klamath river basin, california. we also evaluated fitness consequences of the half-pounder phenotype using a simple life history model that was parameterized with our empirical data and outputs from a regional survival equation. the incidence of the half-pounder life history differed among subbasins of origin and smolt ages. precocious maturation occurred in approximately 8% of half-pounders and was best predicted by individual length in freshwater preceding ocean entry. adult steelhead of the half-pounder phenotype were smaller and less fecund at age than adult steelhead of the alternative (ocean contingent) phenotype. however, our data suggest that fish of t...
the legionella pneumophila effector lpg1137 is a homologue of mitochondrial slc25 carrier proteins, not of known serine proteases automated protein structure prediction is becoming a mainstream tool for biological research. this has been fueled by steady improvements of publicly available automated servers over the last decade, in particular their ability to build good homology models for an increasing number of targets by reliably detecting and aligning more and more remotely homologous templates. here, we describe the three fully automated versions of the hhpred server that participated in the community‐wide blind protein structure prediction competition casp8. what makes hhpred unique is the combination of usability, short response times (typically under 15 min) and a model accuracy that is competitive with those of the best servers in casp8. proteins 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
conceptual metaphor, human-computer interaction and music : applying conceptual metaphor to the design and analysis of music interactions tangible interaction research has opened up new ways to interact with computers and extended our imagination of what is possible with digital systems. however, research on tangible user interfaces (tui) seems to have lost sight of the everyday situation of the majority of people who still work with standard computer systems. this paper investigates a design process for applying tui in a gui dominated domain while preserving the functionality of the traditional systems. we exemplify a user centered design process using (1) image schemas as a meta-language for analysis and design and (2) a systematic function allocation of digital and physical user interface elements. we demonstrate this process in the context of the redesign of an invoice verification and posting system of a german beverage company.
modeling photographic composition via triangles we present an algorithm that quickly and accurately estimates vanishing points in images of man-made environments. contrary to previously proposed solutions, ours is neither iterative nor relies on voting in the space of vanishing points. our formulation is based on a recently proposed algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of multiple models called j-linkage. our method avoids representing edges on the gaussian sphere and the computations and error measures are done in the image. we show that a consistency measure between a vanishing point and an edge of the image can be computed in closed-form while being geometrically meaningful. finally, given a set of estimated vanishing points, we show how this consistency measure can be used to identify the three vanishing points corresponding to the manhattan directions. we compare our algorithm with other approaches on the york urban database and show significant performance improvements.
exploring scale-induced feature hierarchies in natural images this paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. the features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3d viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. the features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. this paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. the recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. this approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.
intra-individual changes in dna methylation not mediated by cell-type composition are correlated with aging during childhood the central importance of epigenetics to the aging process is increasingly being recognized. here we perform a methylome-wide association study (mwas) of aging in whole blood dna from 718 individuals, aged 25-92 years (mean = 55). we sequenced the methyl-cpg-enriched genomic dna fraction, averaging 67.3 million reads per subject, to obtain methylation measurements for the ∼27 million autosomal cpgs in the human genome. following extensive quality control, we adaptively combined methylation measures for neighboring, highly-correlated cpgs into 4 344 016 cpg blocks with which we performed association testing. eleven age-associated differentially methylated regions (dmrs) passed bonferroni correction (p-value < 1.15 × 10(-8)). top findings replicated in an independent sample set of 558 subjects using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted dna (min p-value < 10(-30)). to examine biological themes, we selected 70 dmrs with false discovery rate of <0.1. of these, 42 showed hypomethylation and 28 showed hypermethylation with age. hypermethylated dmrs were more likely to overlap with cpg islands and shores. hypomethylated dmrs were more likely to be in regions associated with polycomb/regulatory proteins (e.g. ezh2) or histone modifications h3k27ac, h3k4m1, h3k4m2, h3k4m3 and h3k9ac. among genes implicated by the top dmrs were protocadherins, homeobox genes, mapks and ryanodine receptors. several of our dmrs are at genes with potential relevance for age-related disease. this study successfully demonstrates the application of next-generation sequencing to mwas, by interrogating a large proportion of the methylome and returning potentially novel age dmrs, in addition to replicating several loci implicated in previous studies using microarrays.
relation between parent psychiatric symptoms and youth problems: moderation through family structure and youth gender context decades of randomized controlled trials have produced separate evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth, but these treatments are not often used in clinical practice, and they produce mixed results in trials with the comorbid, complex youths seen in practice. an integrative, modular redesign may help.   objective standard/separate and modular/integrated arrangements of evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth were compared with usual care treatment, with the modular design permitting a multidisorder focus and a flexible application of treatment procedures.   design randomized effectiveness trial.   setting ten outpatient clinical service organizations in massachusetts and hawaii.   participants a total of 84 community clinicians were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions for the treatment of 174 clinically referred youths who were 7 to 13 years of age (70% of these youths were boys, and 45% were white). the study was conducted during the period from january 12, 2005 to may 8, 2009.   interventions standard manual treatment (59 youths [34% of the sample]; cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, and behavioral parent training for conduct problems), modular treatment (62 youths [36%]; integrating the procedures of the 3 separate treatments), and usual care (53 youths [30%]).   main outcome measures outcomes were assessed using weekly youth and parent assessments. these assessments relied on a standardized brief problem checklist and a patient-generated top problems assessment (ie, the severity ratings on the problems that the youths and parents had identified as most important). we also conducted a standardized diagnostic assessment before and after treatment.   results mixed effects regression analyses showed that modular treatment produced significantly steeper trajectories of improvement than usual care and standard treatment on multiple brief problem checklist and top problems assessment measures. youths receiving modular treatment also had significantly fewer diagnoses than youths receiving usual care after treatment. in contrast, outcomes of standard manual treatment did not differ significantly from outcomes of usual care.   conclusions the modular approach outperformed usual care and standard evidence-based treatments on multiple clinical outcome measures. the modular approach may be a promising way to build on the strengths of evidence-based treatments, improving their utility and effectiveness with referred youths in clinical practice settings. trial registration  clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01178554.
a geometrical model of vertical translation and alar ligament tension in atlanto-axial rotation rheumatoid arthritis frequently contributes to instability of the upper cervical spine. rotational instability of the upper cervical spine was evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis patients using biplanar x-ray photogrammetry. three-dimensional cervical motion and the instantaneous axis of rotation of the atlas relative to the axis were evaluated in normal and rheumatoid arthritis patients during axial rotation in the horizontal plane. anterior atlantoaxial subluxation did not increase during axial head rotation in either the atlantoaxial subluxation or the vertical subluxation groups, while the instantaneous axes of rotation were distributed posteriorly in the dens in the ra-normal group, but were widely scattered in the atlantoaxial subluxation group.
sustained activation of the her1-erk1/2-rsk signaling pathway controls myoepithelial cell fate in human mammary tissue. hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) and egf have been reported to promote branching morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells. we now show that it is epimorphin that is primarily responsible for this phenomenon. in vivo, epimorphin was detected in the stromal compartment but not in lumenal epithelial cells of the mammary gland; in culture, however, a subpopulation of mammary epithelial cells produced significant amounts of epimorphin. when epimorphin-expressing epithelial cell clones were cultured in collagen gels they displayed branching morphogenesis in the presence of hgf, egf, keratinocyte growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor, a process that was inhibited by anti-epimorphin but not anti-hgf antibodies. the branch length, however, was roughly proportional to the ability of the factors to induce growth. accordingly, epimorphin-negative epithelial cells simply grew in a cluster in response to the growth factors and failed to branch. when recombinant epimorphin was added to these collagen gels, epimorphin-negative cells underwent branching morphogenesis. the mode of action of epimorphin on morphogenesis of the gland, however, was dependent on how it was presented to the mammary cells. if epimorphin was overexpressed in epimorphin-negative epithelial cells under regulation of an inducible promoter or was allowed to coat the surface of each epithelial cell in a nonpolar fashion, the cells formed globular, alveoli-like structures with a large central lumen instead of branching ducts. this process was enhanced also by addition of hgf, egf, or other growth factors and was inhibited by epimorphin antibodies. these results suggest that epimorphin is the primary morphogen in the mammary gland but that growth factors are necessary to achieve the appropriate cell numbers for the resulting morphogenesis to be visualized.
transcriptome characteristics and x-chromosome inactivation status in cultured rat pluripotent stem cells. rats have important advantages over mice as an experimental system for physiological and pharmacological investigations. the lack of rat embryonic stem (es) cells has restricted the availability of transgenic technologies to create genetic models in this species. here, we show that rat es cells can be efficiently derived, propagated, and genetically manipulated in the presence of small molecules that specifically inhibit gsk3, mek, and fgf receptor tyrosine kinases. these rat es cells express pluripotency markers and retain the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. most importantly, they can produce high rates of chimerism when reintroduced into early stage embryos and can transmit through the germline. establishment of authentic rat es cells will make possible sophisticated genetic manipulation to create models for the study of human diseases.
novel mutations in ribosomal proteins l4 and l22 that confer erythromycin resistance in escherichia coli using lacl-z fusion strains of escherichia coli we have devised systems that detect deletions of varying lengths. we examined deletions 700-1000 base pairs long, and genetically characterized over 250 spontaneous deletions. of these, we analyzed 24 by direct dna sequencing and 18 by inspection of restriction fragment patterns. deletions of this size occur almost exclusively at short repeated sequences in both (reca+ and reca- strain backgrounds, but are detected 25-fold more frequently in a reca+ background. the frequency of deletion formation correlates with the extent of homology between the short repeated sequences, although other factors may be involved. the largest hotspot, which accounts for 60% of the deletions detected, involves the largest homology in the system (14 of 17 base pairs). altering a single base pair within this homology reduces deletion incidence by an order of magnitude. we discuss possible mechanisms of deletion formation and consider its relationship to the excision of transposable elements.
mipstr: a method for multiplex genotyping of germline and somatic str variation across many individuals. motivation in the past few years, human genome structural variation discovery has enjoyed increased attention from the genomics research community. many studies were published to characterize short insertions, deletions, duplications and inversions, and associate copy number variants (cnvs) with disease. detection of new sequence insertions requires sequence data, however, the 'detectable' sequence length with read-pair analysis is limited by the insert size. thus, longer sequence insertions that contribute to our genetic makeup are not extensively researched.   results we present novelseq: a computational framework to discover the content and location of long novel sequence insertions using paired-end sequencing data generated by the next-generation sequencing platforms. our framework can be built as part of a general sequence analysis pipeline to discover multiple types of genetic variation (snps, structural variation, etc.), thus it requires significantly less-computational resources than de novo sequence assembly. we apply our methods to detect novel sequence insertions in the genome of an anonymous donor and validate our results by comparing with the insertions discovered in the same genome using various sources of sequence data.   availability the implementation of the novelseq pipeline is available at http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/strvar.htm   contact eee@gs.washington.edu; cenk@cs.sfu.ca
development of a standardized screening rule for tuberculosis in people living with hiv in resource-constrained settings: individual participant data meta-analysis of observational studies rationale gold miners in south africa undergo annual radiological screening for tuberculosis in an occupational health center of a gold mining company, but the optimal screening algorithm is unclear.   objectives to evaluate methods for active case detection of tuberculosis.   methods a sequential sample of miners attending annual medical examination was screened for tuberculosis using a symptom questionnaire, chest radiograph, and two sputum specimens for microscopy and culture.   measurements and main results there were 1,955 miners included in this study; all were male with a median age of 41 years (range, 20-61 yr). presence of at least one of a trio of symptoms (new or worsening cough, night sweats, or weight loss) had similar sensitivity (29.4%) to either chest radiograph (25.5%) or sputum smear (25.5%). these sensitivities did not differ by hiv status. presence of one or more elements of the symptom trio and/or new radiological abnormality substantially increased sensitivity to 49.0%. specificity of the symptom trio was higher in hiv-uninfected (91.8%) than in hiv-infected persons (88.2%; p = 0.018). specificity of chest radiography and smear were similar (98.7% and 99.0%, respectively) and did not differ by hiv status (both p values > 0.8).   conclusions in a population of gold miners who undergo regular radiological screening, the addition of chest radiography to symptom screening substantially improved the sensitivity and positive predictive value. hiv infection did not alter the sensitivity of the screening tool.
the road to heaven is paved with effort: perceived effort amplifies moral judgment. people and societies seek to combat harmful events. however, because resources are limited, every wrong righted leaves another wrong left unchecked. responses must therefore be calibrated to the magnitude of the harm. one underappreciated factor that affects this calibration may be people’s oversensitivity to intent. across a series of studies, people saw intended harms as worse than unintended harms, even though the two harms were identical. this harm-magnification effect occurred for both subjective and monetary estimates of harm, and it remained when participants were given incentives to be accurate. the effect was fully mediated by blame motivation. people may therefore focus on intentional harms to the neglect of unintentional (but equally damaging) harms.
chronic pain assessments in children and adolescents: a systematic literature review of the selection, administration, interpretation, and reporting of unidimensional pain intensity scales unlabelled a number of adolescents with chronic pain have clinically significant disability across physical, social, and academic activities, and pain severity only explains a portion of the variance in functioning. thus, it is important to identify therapeutic options to improve adolescents' functioning. in contrast to studies with adults with chronic pain, research in pediatric pain has not consistently found anxiety to be a good predictor of pain-related disability. the present study evaluated pain, anxiety, and functioning in 222 adolescents with chronic pain. results indicated that pain was consistently and linearly related to disability across measures of physical and social functioning, school attendance, and physician visits. the relation between anxiety and functioning was complex; increased anxiety was related to poorer physical and social functioning and was related to fewer physician visits, although it was not associated with school attendance. additional analyses revealed that anxiety serves to moderate the relation between pain and functioning. specifically, at high anxiety, pain was not related to functioning, but at low anxiety, pain consistently predicted disability. in other words, highly anxious adolescents were functioning poorly regardless of the level of pain. the moderating role of anxiety highlights a number of research and clinical possibilities to explore with adolescents with chronic pain-related disability.   perspective data suggest that high anxiety is associated with poor functioning irrespective of pain intensity. at low anxiety, higher pain predicted greater disability. anxiety is important to assess when investigating potential reasons for pain-related disability.
mitigating adversarial effects through randomization very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. one example is the inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ilsvrc challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation inception-v3 network. this raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the inception architecture with residual connections. here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of inception networks significantly. there is also some evidence of residual inception networks outperforming similarly expensive inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. we also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual inception networks. these variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ilsvrc 2012 classification task significantly. we further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual inception networks. with an ensemble of three residual and one inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the imagenet classification (cls) challenge
epidemiology of congenital heart defects (chd): results from a prospective, population-based cohort study (epicard) aims to estimate the risk of congenital heart defects (chd) associated with assisted reproductive technologies (art).   methods and results we used data from the paris registry of congenital malformations on 5493 cases of chd and 3847 malformed controls for which no associations with art were reported in the literature. assisted reproductive technologies included inductors of ovulation only, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. exposure to art was higher for cases than controls (4.7 vs. 3.6%, p= 0.008) and was associated with a 40% increase in the maternal age, socioeconomic factors, and year of birth-adjusted odds of chd without chromosomal abnormalities [adjusted odds ratio (or) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.1-1.7]. assisted reproductive technologies were specifically associated with significant increases in the odds of malformations of the outflow tracts and ventriculoarterial connections (adjusted or 1.7, 95% ci 1.2-2.4) and of cardiac neural crest defects and double outlet right ventricle (adjusted or 1.7, 95% ci 1.1-2.7). in general, we found specific associations between methods of art and subcategories of chd.   conclusion cases with chd were more likely to have been conceived following art when compared with malformed controls. this higher risk for chd varied specifically according to the method of art and the type of chd and may be due to art per se and/or the underlying infertility of couples.
gastrointestinal problems in children with autism, developmental delays or typical development diagnoses for autism based on the autism diagnostic interview-revised (adi-r) and the childhood autism rating scale (cars) were examined for 83 individuals with suspected autism. agreement between systems reached 85.7%. participants receiving diagnosis of autism based on only one system were significantly younger in age than individuals receiving diagnoses according to both systems. individuals who did not receive diagnosis of autism on the adi-r had lower chronological and mental ages and lower cars scores compared to individuals who received diagnosis of autism based on the adi-r. eighteen females and 18 males were matched to examine possible gender differences. no significant findings were revealed, suggesting that the symptoms of autism according to the adi-r and cars do not differ between males and females when matched for chronological and mental ages.
soft-body muscles for evolved virtual creatures: the next step on a bio-mimetic path to meaningful morphological complexity this article describes a system for the evolution and coevolution of virtual creatures that compete in physically simulated three-dimensional worlds. pairs of individuals enter one-on-one contests in which they contend to gain control of a common resource. the winners receive higher relative fitness scores allowing them to survive and reproduce. realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. the morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. the genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. when simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strategies and counterstrategies emerge.

inhibition of primate spinothalamic tract neurons by spinal glycine and gaba is modulated by guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. the responsiveness of spinal cord nociceptive neurons to innocuous mechanical stimuli can be increased by the release of excitatory amino acids (eaas) and peptides attributable to an injury-induced barrage of impulses. this sensitization of spinal dorsal horn neurons can also result from administration of phorbol ester by microdialysis, presumably by direct activation of protein kinase c (pkc). this study was designed to examine the effects of central sensitization of spinothalamic tract (stt) neurons produced by intradermal injection of capsaicin on the descending inhibition driven from the periaqueductal gray (pag) and the possible role of pkc in this process in anesthetized monkeys. sensitization of responses of stt cells to mechanical stimuli was induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin. pag inhibition was significantly attenuated when sensitization of responses to mechanical stimuli occurred. however, perfusion of the spinal cord with npc15437 (a selective pkc inhibitor) by microdialysis could prevent the sensitization of the responses to mechanical stimuli and the reduction in pag inhibition of these responses induced by capsaicin injection. results similar to those produced by capsaicin injection were observed when a pkc activator, phorbol ester (12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), was infused within the dorsal horn by microdialysis. an inactive phorbol ester (4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate) had no effect. these results provide evidence that the activation of pkc contributes to the development of central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons produced by chemical stimulation with capsaicin. attenuation of the effectiveness of pag inhibition takes place when the sensitization of dorsal horn cells develops, and pkc may play a significant role in this process.
factors associated with red blood cell transfusions in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants in brazilian neonatal units bronchopulmonary dysplasia has become the most common pulmonary sequelae in neonates receiving mechanical ventilation. the pathogenesis of bpd is multifactorial, but prematurity, positive pressure ventilation, oxygen toxicity and pulmonary edema are some of the most important factors in its development. by minimizing these factors, it is possible to reduce the incidence and severity of bpd.
different statistical approaches to investigate porcine muscle metabolome profiles to highlight new biomarkers for pork quality assessment background advances in “omics” technologies have revolutionized the collection of biological data. a matching revolution in our understanding of biological systems, however, will only be realized when similar advances are made in informatic analysis of the resulting “big data.” here, we compare the capabilities of three conventional and novel statistical approaches to summarize and decipher the tomato metabolome. methodology principal component analysis (pca), batch learning self-organizing maps (bl-som) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna) were applied to a multivariate nmr dataset collected from developmentally staged tomato fruits belonging to several genotypes. while pca and bl-som are appropriate and commonly used methods, wgcna holds several advantages in the analysis of highly multivariate, complex data. conclusions pca separated the two major genetic backgrounds (ac and nc), but provided little further information. both bl-som and wgcna clustered metabolites by expression, but wgcna additionally defined “modules” of co-expressed metabolites explicitly and provided additional network statistics that described the systems properties of the tomato metabolic network. our first application of wgcna to tomato metabolomics data identified three major modules of metabolites that were associated with ripening-related traits and genetic background.
how to train dependency parsers with inexact search for joint sentence boundary detection and parsing of entire documents training higher-order conditional random fields is prohibitive for huge tag sets. we present an approximated conditional random field using coarse-to-fine decoding and early updating. we show that our implementation yields fast and accurate morphological taggers across six languages with different morphological properties and that across languages higher-order models give significant improvements over 1-order models.
mri‐related static magnetic stray fields and postural body sway: a double‐blind randomized crossover study there are concerns about workers repeatedly exposed to magnetic fields exceeding regulatory limits with respect to modern magnetic resonance imaging (mri). as a result, there is need for an ambulatory magnetic field dosimeter capable of measuring these fields in and around an mri scanner in order to evaluate the regulatory guidelines and determine any underlying exposure risks. this study presents results of tri-axial measurements using an ambulatory magnetic field dosimeter worn by workers during normal working shifts. we recorded and analyzed magnetic field exposures in and around 1.5 t, 2 t, and 4 t magnets during routine patient procedures. the data was integrated and averaged over time and evaluated against the latest exposure standards. time-varying magnetic fields occur when individuals move through spatially non-uniform static magnetic fields or during gradient-pulsed magnetic fields or a combination of both. our previous numerical analysis shows that at certain positions surrounding the mri scanner ends, such fields may induce current densities and electric fields that may exceed the relevant eu, icnirp, and ieee standards. a high-speed acquisition version of the dosimeter measured gradient-pulsed fields at positions accessible by mri workers near the scanner ends, and the results were evaluated and compared against the numerical simulations and the standards. our measurements confirm that workers can be exposed to magnetic fields exceeding the guidelines at positions near the gradient coil ends during clinical imaging and a high degree of correlation exists with the numerical results. while the time-weighted average magnetic field exposures in 1.5 t, 2 t, and 4 t were all within the regulatory limits during static magnetic field measurements, the peak limits for the head can be exceeded in some circumstances. this study presents a small number of routine shifts of data that provide indicative results of magnetic field exposure in real situations.
immunization of pigs with an attenuated pseudorabies virus recombinant expressing the haemagglutinin of pandemic swine origin h1n1 influenza a virus. attenuated vaccine strains of the alphaherpesvirus causing infectious laryngotracheitis of chickens (iltv, gallid herpesvirus 1) can be used for mass application. previously, we showed that live virus vaccination with recombinant iltv expressing hemagglutinin of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (hpaiv) protected chickens against ilt and fowl plague caused by hpaiv carrying the corresponding hemagglutinin subtypes [lüschow d, werner o, mettenleiter tc, fuchs w. protection of chickens from lethal avian influenza a virus infection by live-virus vaccination with infectious laryngotracheitis virus recombinants expressing the hemagglutinin (h5) gene. vaccine 2001;19(30):4249-59; veits j, lüschow d, kindermann k, werner o, teifke jp, mettenleiter tc, et al. deletion of the non-essential ul0 gene of infectious laryngotracheitis (ilt) virus leads to attenuation in chickens, and ul0 mutants expressing influenza virus haemagglutinin (h7) protect against ilt and fowl plague. j gen virol 2003;84(12):3343-52]. however, protection against h5n1 hpaiv was not satisfactory. therefore, a newly designed dutpase-negative iltv vector was used for rapid insertion of the h5-hemagglutinin, or n1-neuraminidase genes of a recent h5n1 hpaiv isolate. compared to our previous constructs, protein expression was considerably enhanced by insertion of synthetic introns downstream of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter within the 5'-nontranslated region of the transgenes. deletion of the viral dutpase gene did not affect in vitro replication of the iltv recombinants, but led to sufficient attenuation in vivo. after a single ocular immunization, all chickens developed h5- or n1-specific serum antibodies. nevertheless, animals immunized with n1-iltv died after subsequent h5n1 hpaiv challenge, although survival times were prolonged compared to non-vaccinated controls. in contrast, all chickens vaccinated with either h5-iltv alone, or h5- and n1-iltv simultaneously, survived without showing any clinical signs. real-time rt-pcr indicated limited challenge virus replication after vaccination with h5-iltv only, which was completely blocked after coimmunization with n1-iltv. thus, chickens can be protected from h5n1 hpaiv-induced disease by live vaccination with an attenuated hemagglutinin-expressing iltv recombinant, and efficacy can be further increased by coadministration of an iltv mutant expressing neuraminidase. furthermore, chickens vaccinated with iltv vectors can be easily differentiated from influenza virus-infected animals by the absence of serum antibodies against the aiv nucleoprotein.
predicting protein molecular function genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large fraction of the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared by all eukaryotes. knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. the goal of the gene ontology consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. to this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the world-wide web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.
population genetics of plasmodium vivax in the peruvian amazon backgroundperu is one of the latin american countries with the highest malaria burden, mainly due to plasmodium vivax infections. however, little is known about p. vivax transmission dynamics in the peruvian amazon, where most malaria cases occur. the genetic diversity and population structure of p. vivax isolates collected in different communities around iquitos city, the capital of the peruvian amazon, was determined.methodsplasmodium vivax population structure was determined by multilocus genotyping with 16 microsatellites on 159 p. vivax infected blood samples (mono-infections) collected in four sites around iquitos city. the population characteristics were assessed only in samples with monoclonal infections (n = 94), and the genetic diversity was determined by calculating the expected heterozygosity and allelic richness. both linkage disequilibrium and the genetic differentiation (θ) were estimated.resultsthe proportion of polyclonal infections varied substantially by site (11% - 70%), with the expected heterozygosity ranging between 0.44 and 0.69; no haplotypes were shared between the different populations. linkage disequilibrium was present in all populations (ias 0.14 - 0.61) but was higher in those with fewer polyclonal infections, suggesting inbreeding and a clonal population structure. strong population differentiation (θ = 0.45) was found and the bayesian inference cluster analysis identified six clusters based on distinctive allele frequencies.conclusionthe p. vivax populations circulating in the peruvian amazon basin are genetically diverse, strongly differentiated and they have a low effective recombination rate. these results are in line with the low and clustered pattern of malaria transmission observed in the region around iquitos city.
evaluation of replication of variants associated with genetic risk of otitis media otitis media (om) is the most common childhood disease. almost all children experience at least one episode, but morbidity is greatest in children who experience chronic/recurrent om (come/rom). there is mounting evidence that come/rom clusters in families and exhibits substantial heritability. subjects who had tympanostomy tube surgery for come/rom (probands) and their families were recruited for the present study, and an ear examination was performed, without knowledge of the subject's history, to determine presence of om sequelae. in addition, tympanometric testing was performed at three frequencies (226, 630 or 710, and 1,400 hz) to detect abnormal middle-ear mechanics, and hearing was screened at 20 db for the speech frequencies. of these families, 121 had at least two individuals who had received the diagnosis of come/rom (364 affected and genotyped individuals), of whom 238 affected and informative relative pairs were used for analyses. single-point nonparametric linkage analysis provided evidence of linkage of come/rom to chromosome 10q at marker d10s212 (lod 3.78; p=3.0 x 10(-5)) and to chromosome 19q at marker d19s254 (lod 2.61; p=5.3 x 10(-4)). analyses conditional on support for linkage at chromosomes 10q and 19q resulted in a significant increase in lod score support on chromosome 3p (between markers d3s4545 and d3s1259). these results suggest that risk of come/rom is determined by interactions between genes that reside in several candidate regions of the genome and are probably modulated by other environmental risk factors.
style obfuscation by invariance we present the word mover's distance (wmd), a novel distance function between text documents. our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. the wmd distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. we show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the earth mover's distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the wmd metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.
apoptosis of lens epithelial cells induced by high concentration of glucose is associated with a decrease in caveolin-1 levels gpi-linked protein molecules become triton-insoluble during polarized sorting to the apical cell surface of epithelial cells. these insoluble complexes, enriched in cholesterol, glycolipids, and gpi-linked proteins, have been isolated by flotation on sucrose density gradients and are thought to contain the putative gpi-sorting machinery. as the cellular origin and molecular protein components of this complex remain unknown, we have begun to characterize these low-density insoluble complexes isolated from mdck cells. we find that these complexes, which represent 0.4-0.8% of the plasma membrane, ultrastructurally resemble caveolae and are over 150-fold enriched in a model gpi-anchored protein and caveolin, a caveolar marker protein. however, they exclude many other plasma membrane associated molecules and organelle-specific marker enzymes, suggesting that they represent microdomains of the plasma membrane. in addition to caveolin, these insoluble complexes contain a subset of hydrophobic plasma membrane proteins and cytoplasmically-oriented signaling molecules, including: (a) gtp- binding proteins--both small and heterotrimeric; (b) annex ii--an apical calcium-regulated phospholipid binding protein with a demonstrated role in exocytic fusion events; (c) c-yes--an apically localized member of the src family of non-receptor type protein- tyrosine kinases; and (d) an unidentified serine-kinase activity. as we demonstrate that caveolin is both a transmembrane molecule and a major phospho-acceptor component of these complexes, we propose that caveolin could function as a transmembrane adaptor molecule that couples luminal gpi-linked proteins with cytoplasmically oriented signaling molecules during gpi-membrane trafficking or gpi-mediated signal transduction events. in addition, our results have implications for understanding v- src transformation and the actions of cholera and pertussis toxins on hetero-trimeric g proteins.
the candida albicans homologue of pig-p, cagpi19p: gene dosage and role in growth and filamentation. abstract ras oncoproteins are monomeric gtpases that link signals from the cell surface to pathways that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. constitutively active mutant forms of ras are found in ca. 30% of human tumors. here we report the isolation of a novel gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae, designated eri1 (for endoplasmic reticulum-associated ras inhibitor 1), which behaves genetically as an inhibitor of ras signaling. eri1 encodes a 68-amino-acid protein that associates in vivo with gtp-bound ras in a manner that requires an intact ras-effector loop, suggesting that eri1 competes for the same binding site as ras target proteins. we show that eri1 localizes primarily to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (er), where it engages ras. the recent demonstration that signaling from mammalian ras is not restricted to the cell surface but can also proceed from the cytoplasmic face of the er suggests a regulatory function for eri1 at that membrane.
membuilder: a web-based graphical interface to build heterogeneously mixed membrane bilayers for the gromacs biomolecular simulation program biological membranes are versatile in composition and host intriguing molecular processes. in order to be able to study these systems, an accurate model hamiltonian or force field (ff) is a necessity. here, we report the results of our extension of earlier developed all-atomistic ff parameters for fully saturated phospholipids that complements an earlier parameter set for saturated phosphatidylcholine lipids (j. phys. chem. b, 2012, 116, 3164-3179). the ff, coined slipids (stockholm lipids), now also includes parameters for unsaturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, e.g., popc, dopc, sopc, pope, and dope. as the extended set of parameters is derived with the same philosophy as previously applied, the resulting ff has been developed in a fully consistent manner. the capabilities of slipids are demonstrated by performing long simulations without applying any surface tension and using the correct isothermal-isobaric (npt) ensemble for a range of temperatures and carefully comparing a number of properties with experimental findings. results show that several structural properties are very well reproduced, such as scattering form factors, nmr order parameters, thicknesses, and area per lipid. thermal dependencies of different thicknesses and area per lipid are reproduced as well. lipid diffusion is systematically slightly underestimated, whereas the normalized lipid diffusion follows the experimental trends. this is believed to be due to the lack of collective movement in the relatively small bilayer patches used. furthermore, the compatibility with amino acid ffs from the amber family is tested in explicit transmembrane complexes of the walp23 peptide with dlpc and dopc bilayers, and this shows that slipids can be used to study more complex and biologically relevant systems.
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease after high-dose intravenous busulfan/melphalan conditioning therapy in high-risk ewing sarcoma sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, also known as veno-occlusive disease (sos/vod), is a potentially life threatening complication that can develop after hematopoietic cell transplantation. although sos/vod progressively resolves within a few weeks in most patients, the most severe forms result in multi-organ dysfunction and are associated with a high mortality rate (>80%). therefore, careful attention must be paid to allow an early detection of sos/vod, particularly as drugs have now proven to be effective and licensed for its treatment. unfortunately, current criteria lack sensitivity and specificity, making early identification and severity assessment of sos/vod difficult. the aim of this work is to propose a new definition for diagnosis, and a severity-grading system for sos/vod in adult patients, on behalf of the european society for blood and marrow transplantation.
removing noisy mentions for distant supervision distant supervision for relation extraction (re) -- gathering training data by aligning a database of facts with text -- is an efficient approach to scale re to thousands of different relations. however, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. for example, a sentence containing balzac and france may express bornin or died, an unknown relation, or no relation at all. because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. we propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for re, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. our model performs competitively on two difficult domains.
dna-dna hybridization study of strains of chryseobacterium, elizabethkingia and empedobacter and of other usually indole-producing non-fermenters of cdc groups iic, iie, iih and iii, mostly from human clinical sources, and proposals of chryseobacterium bernardetii sp. nov., chryseobacterium carnis s the name escherichia vulneris sp. nov. (formerly called alma group 1 and enteric group 1 by the centers for disease control and api group 2 by analytab products, inc.) is proposed for a group of isolates from the united states and canada, 74% of which were from human wounds. e. vulneris is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative, fermentative, motile rod with the characteristics of the family enterobacteriaceae. biochemical reactions characteristic of 61 e. vulneris strains were positive tests for methyl red, malonate, and lysine decarboxylase; a delayed positive test for arginine dihydrolase; acid production from d-mannitol, l-arabinose, raffinose, l-rhamnose, d-xylose, trehalose, cellobiose, and melibiose; negative tests for voges-proskauer, indole, urea, h(2)s, citrate, ornithine decarboxylase, phenylalanine deaminase, and dnase; and no acid from dulcitol, adonitol, myo-inositol, and d-sorbitol. two-thirds of the strains produced yellow pigment. most strains gave negative or delayed positive reactions in tests for lactose, sucrose, and kcn. the e. vulneris strains tested were resistant to penicillin and clindamycin, were resistant or showed intermediate zones of inhibition to carbenicillin and erythromycin, and were susceptible to 14 other antibiotics. dna relatedness of 15 e. vulneris strains to the type strain averaged 75% in reactions at 60 degrees c and 69% in reactions at 75 degrees c, indicating that they comprise a separate species. dna relatedness to other species in the family enterobacteriaceae was 6 to 39%, an indication that this new species belongs in the family. e. vulneris showed the highest relatedness to species of escherichia (25 to 39%) and enterobacter (24 to 35%). on the basis of biochemical similarity, the new species was placed in the genus escherichia. the type strain of e. vulneris is atcc 33821 (cdc 875-72).
vascular autorescaling of fmri (vasa fmri) improves sensitivity of population studies: a pilot study the human connectome project (hcp) seeks to map the structural and functional connections between network elements in the human brain. magnetoencephalography (meg) provides a temporally rich source of information on brain network dynamics and represents one source of functional connectivity data to be provided by the hcp. high quality meg data will be collected from 50 twin pairs both in the resting state and during performance of motor, working memory and language tasks. these data will be available to the general community. additionally, using the cortical parcellation scheme common to all imaging modalities, the hcp will provide processing pipelines for calculating connection matrices as a function of time and frequency. together with structural and functional data generated using magnetic resonance imaging methods, these data represent a unique opportunity to investigate brain network connectivity in a large cohort of normal adult human subjects. the analysis pipeline software and the dynamic connectivity matrices that it generates will all be made freely available to the research community.
circulating micrornas as a novel class of diagnostic biomarkers in gastrointestinal tumors detection: a meta-analysis based on 42 articles background:plasma circulating tumour-specific micrornas (mirnas) are promising biomarkers of tumour presence and recurrence, especially for diseases whose best chance of successful treatment requires early diagnosis and timely surgery of an already malignant but not yet invasive tumour, such as colorectal cancer (crc).methods:expression levels of mirnas previously found to be differently expressed in tumour vs normal colon tissues were investigated by quantitative real-time pcr in plasma from crc patients and from healthy donors and confirmed in independent case control series. the validated mirnas were also measured after surgery. analyses were repeated on the subsets of haemolysis-free samples.results:we identified four mirnas differently expressed between the compared groups, two (mir-21 and mir-378) of which were validated. mir-378 expression decreased in non-relapsed patients 4–6 months after surgery and mir-378 ability to discriminate crc patients from healthy individuals was not influenced by haemolysis levels of plasma samples.conclusion:the mirna analysis on plasma samples represents a useful non-invasive tool to assess crc presence as well as tumour-free status at follow-up. plasma levels of mir-378 could be used to discriminate crc patients from healthy individuals, irrespective of the level of haemoglobin of plasma samples.

fungal and bacterial growth in floor dust at elevated relative humidity levels abstract we introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. this method, unifrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. unifrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. we demonstrate the utility of unifrac by applying it to published 16s rrna gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the arctic and antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. these results illustrate that unifrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rrna sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.
epitope-specific anti-hcg vaccines on a virus like particle platform filamentous phages are now the most widely used vehicles for phage display and provide efficient means for epitope identification. however, the peptides they display are not very immunogenic because they normally fail to present foreign epitopes at the very high densities required for efficient b-cell activation. meanwhile, systems based on virus-like particles (vlps) permit the engineered high-density display of specific epitopes but are incapable of peptide library display and affinity selection. we developed a new peptide display platform based on vlps of the rna bacteriophage ms2. it combines the high immunogenicity of ms2 vlps with the affinity selection capabilities of other phage display systems. here, we describe plasmid vectors that facilitate the construction of high-complexity random sequence peptide libraries on ms2 vlps and that allow control of the stringency of affinity selection through the manipulation of display valency. we used the system to identify epitopes for several previously characterized monoclonal antibody targets and showed that the vlps thus obtained elicit antibodies in mice whose activities mimic those of the selecting antibodies.
drug-target interaction prediction by integrating multiview network data identifying drug-target interactions has been a key step for drug repositioning, drug discovery and drug design. since it is expensive to determine the interactions experimentally, computational methods are needed for predicting interactions. in this work, the authors first propose a single-view penalised graph (spgraph) clustering approach to integrate drug structure and protein sequence data in a structural view. the spgraph model does clustering on drugs and targets simultaneously such that the known drug-target interactions are best preserved in the clustering results. they then apply the spgraph to a chemical view with drug response data and gene expression data in nci-60 cell lines. they further generalise the spgraph to a multi-view penalised graph (mpgraph) version, which can integrate the structural view and chemical view of the data. in the authors' experiments, they compare their approach with some comparison partners, and the results show that the spgraph could improve the prediction accuracy in a small scale, and the mpgraph can achieve around 10% improvements for the prediction accuracy. they finally give some new targets for 22 food and drug administration approved drugs for drug repositioning, and some can be supported by other references.
biological activity evaluation and molecular docking study of chromone derivatives as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors rous sarcoma virus was shown to induce in chicken embryo fibroblasts (cef) a 4.1-kilobase mrna (designated cef-147) encoding a 603-amino acid protein. analysis of the protein sequence showed that it shared 59% amino acid identity with sheep prostaglandin g/h synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting steps in the production of prostaglandins. significant differences, at both the protein and mrna levels, existed between the src oncogene product-inducible prostaglandin synthase and the protein isolated and cloned from sheep seminal vesicle, suggesting that the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase may be a new form of the enzyme. a distinguishing feature of src-inducible prostaglandin synthase mrna is its low abundance in nonproliferating chicken embryo fibroblasts and its relatively high abundance in src-transformed cells. additionally, the majority of the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase rna present in nonproliferating cells was found to be nonfunctional because of the presence of an unspliced intron that separated the signal peptide from the remainder of the protein. upon mitogenic stimulation, this intron was removed, resulting in the induction of fully-spliced cef-147 mrna.
structural and logical analysis of a comprehensive hedgehog signaling pathway to identify alternative drug targets for glioma, colon and pancreatic cancer kit, platelet‐derived growth factor receptors (pdgfrs) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (vegfrs) are important clinical targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitors. the frequency of kit and vegfr2 amplification in glioblastomas is not known, and few data are available in any other human tumour type. we investigated 43 primary glioblastomas for kit, vegfr2, pdgfra and egfr amplification using fluorescence in situ hybridization. kit was amplified in 47% and vegfr2 in 39% of the glioblastomas, respectively, and pdgfra in 29%. thirty‐five (81%) of the tumours had either kit or egfr amplification. kit, pdgfra and vegfr2 amplifications were strongly associated (p < 0.0001 for each pairwise comparison), suggesting co‐amplification, whereas no significant association was found with egfr amplification. the four secondary glioblastomas arising from pre‐existing lower grade astrocytic tumours investigated had kit amplification but none had egfr amplification. no mutations were detected with denaturing high‐performance liquid chromatography in kit exons 9, 11, 13 or 17, pdgfra exons 12 and 18, or egfr exons 18, 19 or 21. glioblastomas with kit, pdgfr or vegfr2 amplification were associated with similar outcome to other glioblastomas. we conclude that kit, pdgfra and vegfr2 are commonly amplified in primary glioblastoma and that they may also be amplified in secondary glioblastoma. amplified kinases may be potential targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. copyright © 2005 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
mycetophilidae (diptera), an insect group vulnerable to forestry practices? a comparison of clearcut, managed and semi-natural spruce forests in southern norway an understanding of statistical concepts and methods is essential for the clinician who wishes to interpret the results of clinical studies. in this article the concepts of descriptive statistics, classical hypothesis testing, p values, a priori information, and type i and type ii errors are discussed with examples to illustrate their application to the interpretation of clinical trials. in addition, descriptions of student's t test, the chi-squared test, fisher's exact test, the rank sum test, and sequential methods are given.
gestures orchestrate brain networks for language understanding observing a speaker's mouth profoundly influences speech perception. for example, listeners perceive an "illusory" "ta" when the video of a face producing /ka/ is dubbed onto an audio /pa/. here, we show how cortical areas supporting speech production mediate this illusory percept and audiovisual (av) speech perception more generally. specifically, cortical activity during av speech perception occurs in many of the same areas that are active during speech production. we find that different perceptions of the same syllable and the perception of different syllables are associated with different distributions of activity in frontal motor areas involved in speech production. activity patterns in these frontal motor areas resulting from the illusory "ta" percept are more similar to the activity patterns evoked by av(/ta/) than they are to patterns evoked by av(/pa/) or av(/ka/). in contrast to the activity in frontal motor areas, stimulus-evoked activity for the illusory "ta" in auditory and somatosensory areas and visual areas initially resembles activity evoked by av(/pa/) and av(/ka/), respectively. ultimately, though, activity in these regions comes to resemble activity evoked by av(/ta/). together, these results suggest that av speech elicits in the listener a motor plan for the production of the phoneme that the speaker might have been attempting to produce, and that feedback in the form of efference copy from the motor system ultimately influences the phonetic interpretation.
blood pressure response to angiotensin ii, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and polymorphisms of the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor gene in hypertensive sibling pairs the aldosterone response to infused angiotensin ii (ang ii) in patients receiving a low-salt diet has been described as an important phenotype for genetic studies on human hypertension. the objectives of the present study were to determine the parameters that influence this intermediate phenotype as a quantitative trait and to assess the importance of its familial resemblance in hypertensive sibling pairs. two hundred one white hypertensive subjects (95 families: 84 pairs and 11 trios) were selected in 3 centers. the patients followed the same protocol, which included a 4-week withdrawal period of antihypertensive therapy, a 1-week period on a low-salt diet, and a 30-minute infusion of ang ii. the increase in the aldosterone level was greater in women than in men (29.1+/-16.2 versus 18.2+/-9.6 ng/dl, p<0.0001). a strong relationship was found with age (r=-0.54, p<10(-4)) and plasma renin activity (r=0.32, p<10(-4)) in women but not in men. weak correlations of the aldosterone response to ang ii were observed for the whole set of sibling pairs (r=0.11, ns). conversely, strong sibling correlations were found among brother-brother pairs (r=0.40, n=36) and among sister-sister pairs as soon as age or menopausal status was considered. similar results were obtained when the ang i-aldosterone response was analyzed as a qualitative trait (kappa=0. 35, p<0.008 in brother-brother pairs). we conclude that age, gender, and plasma renin are strong determinants of the aldosterone response to ang ii, with strong sibling correlations in men and postmenopausal women. these relationships will have to be considered in future linkage and association studies.
mechanisms of diastolic dysfunction in cardiovascular disease relationship of hyperuricemia with mortality in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction despite advances in the treatment of heart failure (hf), which have resulted in improved survival, overall prognosis continues to be poor. given the high short-term mortality rate, it remains important to utilize assessment techniques with established prognostic value in this patient population. ideally, a given assessment should also be able to accurately reflect disease severity, a heterogeneous phenomenon in patients with hf, and accurately reflect the magnitude of physiologic/clinical improvement following the implementation or titration of an intervention. cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpx) satisfies all of the aforementioned desirable assessment attributes. peak oxygen consumption and the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope are key cpx variables in assessing prognosis and gauging disease severity. given the high value of information obtained from this procedure, cpx should be considered a core assessment in the hf population. the current review will concisely define key cpx variables and summarize their clinical applications in patients with hf.
the fitness effects of synonymous mutations in dna and rna viruses. mutational fitness effects can be measured with relatively high accuracy in viruses due to their small genome size, which facilitates full-length sequencing and genetic manipulation. previous work has shown that animal and plant rna viruses are very sensitive to mutation. here, we characterize mutational fitness effects in single-stranded (ss) dna and ssrna bacterial viruses. first, we performed a mutation-accumulation experiment in which we subjected three ssdna (φx174, g4, f1) and three ssrna phages (qβ, ms2, and sp) to plaque-to-plaque transfers and chemical mutagenesis. genome sequencing and growth assays indicated that the average fitness effect of the accumulated mutations was similar in the two groups. second, we used site-directed mutagenesis to obtain 45 clones of φx174 and 42 clones of qβ carrying random single-nucleotide substitutions and assayed them for fitness. in φx174, 20% of such mutations were lethal, whereas viable ones reduced fitness by 13% on average. in qβ, these figures were 29% and 10%, respectively. it seems therefore that high mutational sensitivity is a general property of viruses with small genomes, including those infecting animals, plants, and bacteria. mutational fitness effects are important for understanding processes of fitness decline, but also of neutral evolution and adaptation. as such, these findings can contribute to explain the evolution of ssdna and ssrna viruses.
interpersonal emotion regulation: implications for affiliation, perceived support, relationships, and well-being we developed a multidimensional coping inventory to assess the different ways in which people respond to stress. five scales (of four items each) measure conceptually distinct aspects of problem-focused coping (active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, restraint coping, seeking of instrumental social support); five scales measure aspects of what might be viewed as emotional-focused coping (seeking of emotional social support, positive reinterpretation, acceptance, denial, turning to religion); and three scales measure coping responses that arguably are less useful (focus on and venting of emotions, behavioral disengagement, mental disengagement). study 1 reports the development of scale items. study 2 reports correlations between the various coping scales and several theoretically relevant personality measures in an effort to provide preliminary information about the inventory's convergent and discriminant validity. study 3 uses the inventory to assess coping responses among a group of undergraduates who were attempting to cope with a specific stressful episode. this study also allowed an initial examination of associations between dispositional and situational coping tendencies.
comparisons of local and systemic aerobic fitness parameters between finswimmers with different athlete grade levels our purpose is to compare the changes in muscle oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (vl) and biceps brachii (bb) muscles simultaneously using near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) during incremental rowing exercise in eight rowers. based on the bb and vl muscle oxygenation patterns, two points are used to characterize the muscle oxygenation kinetics in both the arm and the leg muscles. the first point is the breaking point (bp), which refers to an accelerated fall in muscle oxygenation that correlates with the gas exchange threshold (get). the second point is the leveling-off point (lo), which suggests the upper limit of o(2) extraction. the get occurred at 63.3+/-2.4% of maximal oxygen uptake (vo(2 max)). the bp appeared at 45.0+/-3.8% and 55.6+/-2.4% vo(2 max) in the bb and vl, respectively. the lo appeared at 63.6+/-4.1% and 86.6+/-1.0% vo(2 max) in these two muscles, respectively. both the bp and the lo occurred earlier in bb compared with vl. these results suggest that arm muscles have lower oxidative capacity than leg muscles during rowing exercise. the rowers with higher exercise performances showed heavier workloads, as evaluated by bp and lo. the monitoring of muscle oxygenation by nirs in arm and leg muscles during rowing could be a useful guide for evaluation and training.
bioinformatic analysis of ciliary transition zone proteins reveals insights into the evolution of ciliopathy networks nephronophthisis (nphp), joubert (jbts), and meckel-gruber (mks) syndromes are autosomal-recessive ciliopathies presenting with cystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and cerebellar/neural tube malformation. whether defects in kidney, retinal, or neural disease primarily involve ciliary, hedgehog, or cell polarity pathways remains unclear. using high-confidence proteomics, we identified 850 interactors copurifying with nine nphp/jbts/mks proteins and discovered three connected modules: "nphp1-4-8" functioning at the apical surface, "nphp5-6" at centrosomes, and "mks" linked to hedgehog signaling. assays for ciliogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis in 3d renal cultures link renal cystic disease to apical organization defects, whereas ciliary and hedgehog pathway defects lead to retinal or neural deficits. using 38 interactors as candidates, linkage and sequencing analysis of 250 patients identified atxn10 and tctn2 as new nphp-jbts genes, and our tctn2 mouse knockout shows neural tube and hedgehog signaling defects. our study further illustrates the power of linking proteomic networks and human genetics to uncover critical disease pathways.
statistical mechanics and information-theoretic perspectives on complexity in the earth system entropy, as it relates to dynamical systems, is the rate of information production. methods for estimation of the entropy of a system represented by a time series are not, however, well suited to analysis of the short and noisy data sets encountered in cardiovascular and other biological studies. pincus introduced approximate entropy (apen), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. apen statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. we have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (sampen), and have compared apen and sampen by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. we have also evaluated cross-apen and cross-sampen, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. sampen agreed with theory much more closely than apen over a broad range of conditions. the improved accuracy of sampen statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.
iga anti-b2gpi antibodies in patients with autoimmune liver diseases background primary biliary cirrhosis (pbc)-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (ama), routinely detected by indirect immunofluoresnce, immunofix various mitochondrial antigens by immunoblot (ib). we have investigated whether there is a relationship between ifl-determined ama titres and the number, intensity or pattern of ib-bands.   methods by computer-assisted imaging technology, an ib analysis using human liver mitochondrial preparation was performed in 100 ama positive pbc samples, subdivided in 5 groups each consisting of 20 cases with very high, high, intermediate, low or borderline ifl titres and in 19 ama-negative cases.   results reactivity to at least 1 mitochondrial band (range 1-12) was present in 114 (96%) cases. reactivity to the major pyruvate dehydrogenase e2-subunit 74-kda autoantigen positively correlated with ama ifl titres but was absent in 25% ifl-positive cases. the intensity and number of ib-bands differed significantly among groups (p<0.001). ifl ama titres positively correlated with the total number (r=0.8, p<0.001) and the intensity of the ib-bands (r=0.75, p<0.001).   conclusions our study indicates that ifl-determined ama relate to the number and intensity of immunofixed bands. reactivity to pdc-e2 does not correlate with ifl titres in a considerable proportion of patients suggesting that detection methods of ama need to be based in the entire spectrum of the disease-specific mitochondrial antigens.
indole affects the formation of multicellular aggregate structures in pantoea agglomerans ys19. abstract the l-tryptophan degradation product indole is a purported extracellular signaling molecule that influences biofilm formation in various bacteria. here we analyzed the mechanisms of indole production in fusobacterium nucleatum and the effects of tryptophan and indole on f. nucleatum planktonic and biofilm cells. the amino acid sequence deduced from the fn1943 gene in f. nucleatum atcc 25586 was 28% identical to that deduced from tnaa in escherichia coli, which encodes tryptophanase catalyzing the β-elimination of l-tryptophan to produce indole. the fn1943 gene was cotranscribed with the downstream gene fn1944, which is a homolog of tnab encoding low-affinity tryptophan permease. the transcript started at position −68 or −153 from the first nucleotide of the fn1943 translation initiation codon. real-time quantitative pcr showed that much more f. nucleatum fn1943 transcripts were obtained from log-phase cells than from stationary-phase cells. indole production by the purified recombinant protein encoded by fn1943 was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. the km and kcat of the enzyme were 0.26 ± 0.03 mm and 0.74 ± 0.04 s−1, respectively. f. nucleatum biofilm formation and the biofilm supernatant concentration of indole increased dose dependently with increasing tryptophan concentrations. exogenous indole also increased f. nucleatum biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. even at very high concentrations, tryptophan did not affect fn1943 expression, whereas similar indole concentrations decreased expression. thus, exogenous tryptophan and indole were suggested to increase f. nucleatum biofilms.

dealing with word-internal modification and spelling variation in data-driven lemmatization we present a comparative investigation of word representations for part-of-speech (pos) and morphological tagging, focusing on scenarios with considerable differences between training and test data where a robust approach is necessary. instead of adapting the model towards a specific domain we aim to build a robust model across domains. we developed a test suite for robust tagging consisting of six languages and different domains. we find that representations similar to brown clusters perform best for pos tagging and that word representations based on linguistic morphological analyzers perform best for morphological tagging.
analysis of germline variants in cdh1, igfbp3, mmp1, mmp3, stk15 and vegf in familial and sporadic renal cell carcinoma the search of inherited cancer susceptibility factors is an important subject in cancer epidemiology. analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in various genes revealed a correlation between the presence of specific allelic variants and cancer predisposition in diverse malignancies. stk15 is an important protein in control of the integrity of the mitotic spindle apparatus and genomic stability. we analysed the distribution of the functionally important t91a snp in the stk15 gene in a cohort of renal cell carcinoma (rcc) patients and compared it to the distribution in a control group without malignancies. dna from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy renal tissue (rcc patients) or peripheral blood samples (control group) was isolated according to standard protocols. allelic variant of stk15 nucleotide 91 was determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis. overall, 156 rcc patients and 158 patients without any malignancy were analysed. the distribution of the a/a, 7.59%). there was also no correlation between genotype and tumour grade or stage or other histopathological characteristics of the tumours. this first analysis of the stk15 t91a snp in rcc patients revealed no correlation between a certain allelic variant and an increased risk for rcc.
a comparative study of an innate immune response in lamprologine cichlid fishes many studies have attempted to explain the evolution of cooperation, yet little attention has been paid to what factors control the amount or kind of cooperation performed. kin selection theory suggests that more cooperation, or help, should be given by relatives. however, recent theory suggests that under specific ecological and demographic conditions, unrelated individuals must ‘pay to stay’ in the group and therefore may help more. we tested these contrasting predictions using the cooperatively breeding fish, neolamprologus pulcher, and found that the degree of work effort by helpers depended on which helping behaviours were considered and on their level of relatedness to the breeding male or female. in the field, helpers unrelated to the breeding male performed more territory defence, while helpers unrelated to the breeding female contributed less to territory defence. in the laboratory, unrelated group members helped more. our work demonstrates that a number of factors in addition to kinship shape cooperative investment patterns.
influence of the characteristics of japanese patients on the long-term outcomes after aortic valve replacement: results of a microsimulation background the second-generation carpentier-edwards pericardial valve (edwards lifesciences llc, irvine, ca) is widely used for aortic valve replacement. however, knowledge on the long-term outcomes of patients after valve implantation is incomplete. we used microsimulation to calculate the long-term outcome of any given patient after aortic valve replacement with the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve.   methods a meta-analysis of 8 reports on aortic valve replacement with the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve (2,685 patients; 12,250 patient years) was used to estimate the hazards of valve-related events other than structural valvular deterioration. structural valvular deterioration was described by age-dependent weibull curves calculated from 18-year follow-up, premarket approval, carpentier-edwards pericardial primary data. these estimates provided the input data for the parameters of the microsimulation model, which was then used to calculate the outcomes of patients of different ages after valve implantation. the model estimates of survival were validated using two external data sets.   results the weibull analysis estimated a median time to reoperation for structural valvular deterioration ranging from 18.1 years for a 55-year-old male to 23.2 years for a 75-year-old male. for a 65-year-old male, microsimulation calculated a life expectancy and event-free life expectancy of 10.8 and 9.1 years, respectively. the lifetime risk of at least one valve-related event was 38% and that of reoperation due to structural valvular deterioration 17%, respectively, for this patient. the model estimates of survival showed good agreement with external data.   conclusions microsimulation provides detailed insight into the long-term prognosis of patients after aortic valve replacement. the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve performs satisfactorily and offers a low lifetime risk of reoperation due to structural valvular deterioration, especially for elderly patients requiring aortic valve replacement.
differential proinflammatory and prooxidant effects of bone morphogenetic protein-4 in coronary and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. objective—bone morphogenetic protein 4 (bmp-4) is a transforming growth factor &bgr; family member cytokine that exerts proinflammatory effects on the endothelium and is likely to play a role in atherogenesis. recent studies suggested that atheroprotective levels of shear stress control endothelial bmp-4 expression; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. methods and results—we found that shear stress downregulated bmp-4 expression in human and rat coronary arterial endothelial cells (caecs) as well as in cultured mesenteric arterioles, although it had no effect on the expression of bmp-2, a related cytokine. in human coronary arterial endothelial cells, 8-bromo-camp, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, or a camp-dependent protein kinase (pka) activator effectively decreased bmp-4 expression, mimicking the effects of shear stress. indeed, shear stress induced the nuclear translocation of pka-c, and inhibition of pka attenuated the effects of shear stress and forskolin on bmp-4 expression. rna decay assay and bmp-4 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene assay showed that camp regulates bmp-4 expression at the transcriptional level. conclusions—laminar shear stress and the camp/pka pathway are important negative regulators of bmp-4 expression in the vascular endothelium. because bmp-4 elicits endothelial activation and dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular calcification, inhibition of bmp-4 expression by shear stress and the camp/pka pathway is likely to exert antiatherogenic and vasculoprotective effects.
molecular and phenotypic characterization revealed six colletotrichum species responsible for anthracnose disease of small cardamom in south india we have designed two taxon‐selective primers for the internal transcribed spacer (its) region in the nuclear ribosomal repeat unit. these primers, its1‐f and its4‐b, were intended to be specific to fungi and basidiomycetes, respectively. we have tested the specificity of these primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of plants. our results showed that its4‐b, when paired with either a ‘universal’ primer its1 or the fungal‐specific primer its1‐f, efficiently amplified dna from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete dnas. the results with plants were not as clearcut. the its1‐f/its4‐b primer pair produced a small amount of pcr product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the ‘universal’ its primers. however, under conditions where both plant and fungal dnas were present, the fungal dna was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant dna. its1‐f/its4‐b preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in ectomycorrhizae and in rust‐infected tissues. these primers can be used to study the structure of ectomycorrhizal communities or the distribution of rusts on alternate hosts.
molecular analysis of dengue virus attenuation after serial passage in primary dog kidney cells. virion rnas of 12 geographically distinct dengue type 1 (den-1) virus isolates were clearly unique by rna fingerprinting. isolates from the same geographic area were very similar but differed from those of other areas, allowing us to establish three geographical groupings based upon percent shared oligonucleotides. three caribbean strains were virtually identical (85-91% homologous oligonucleotides) whereas pacific/s.e. asian strains exhibited considerably less homology to one another (44-49%). the pacific/s.e. asian strains exhibited little relationship (20-30%) to the caribbean and african strains. a sri lankan isolate displayed a relatively high degree of homology to nigerian isolates (60-66% homologous oligonucleotides), suggesting that the sri lanka den-1 infection originated from africa. a 1978 nigerian den-1 isolate and the 1969 sri lankan strain each exhibited greater than 50% homology with a 1977 jamaican strain. the similarities observed between the african/sri lankan and jamaican strains suggest that the den-1 virus which caused the 1977 jamaican epidemic may have originated from africa or sri lanka. the rna fingerprint is a unique characteristic of den-1 strains from a particular geographic region, suggesting this technique as a useful tool for dengue epidemiological investigations.
increased levels of circulating microparticles in primary sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis and relation with disease activity objective to determine the cellular origin of synovial microparticles, their procoagulant properties, and their relationship to local hypercoagulation.   methods microparticles in synovial fluid and plasma from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra; n = 10) and patients with other forms of arthritis (non-ra; n = 10) and in plasma from healthy subjects (n = 20) were isolated by centrifugation. microparticles were identified by flow cytometry. the ability of microparticles to support coagulation was determined in normal plasma. concentrations of prothrombin fragment f(1+2) (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [elisa]) and thrombin-antithrombin (tat) complexes (by elisa) were determined as estimates of the coagulation activation status in vivo.   results plasma from patients and healthy controls contained comparable numbers of microparticles, which originated from platelets and erythrocytes. synovial microparticles from ra patients and non-ra patients originated mainly from monocytes and granulocytes; few originated from platelets and erythrocytes. synovial microparticles bound less annexin v (which binds to negatively charged phospholipids) than did plasma microparticles, exposed tissue factor, and supported thrombin generation via factor vii. f(1+2) (median 66 nm) and tat complex (median 710 microg/liter) concentrations were elevated in synovial fluid compared with plasma from the patients (1.6 nm and 7.0 microg/liter, respectively) as well as the controls (1.0 nm and 2.9 microg/liter, respectively).   conclusion synovial fluid contains high numbers of microparticles derived from leukocytes that are strongly coagulant via the factor vii-dependent pathway. we propose that these microparticles contribute to the local hypercoagulation and fibrin deposition in inflamed joints of patients with ra and other arthritic disorders.
sense of coherence as an independent predictor of health-related quality of life among coronary heart disease patients the attention to patient outcome has nowadays extended from morbidity and mortality to an aspect of patients' benefits in terms of quality of life. one factor crucial for quality of life is coping capacity, in this study represented by the sense of coherence concept. physical status and emotional state (often measured by comprehensive instruments not always suitable for clinical use) are also additionally used to reflect quality of life. the purpose was therefore to study sense of coherence and emotional state as indirect measures of quality of life in relation to coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. one hundred and eleven patients were studied by a developed questionnaire on five occasions in relation to the surgery: the week before the angiography, the day before surgery and then at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operatively. the main findings were: (1) the sense of coherence was changed (more than +/-10%) from before to 1 year after surgery in 41% of the patients, which is contrary to the theory of sense of coherence as a stable personality characteristic in adults. (2) experience of depressed mood, stress, and anxiety decreased significantly from before to after surgery. (3) beneficial outcome with regard to sense of coherence was significantly related to less experience of loneliness, depressed mood, stress and anxiety, and to less experience of chest pain 1 year after surgery. in conclusion, sense of coherence and emotional state variables, are suggested to be valuable as measurements of quality of life in relation to coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
magnetic resonance imaging determined visceral fat reduction associates with enhanced il-10 plasma levels in calorie restricted obese subjects the quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (quicki) has an excellent linear correlation with the glucose clamp index of insulin sensitivity (si(clamp)) that is better than that of many other surrogate indexes. however, correlation between a surrogate and reference standard may improve as variability between subjects in a cohort increases (i.e., with an increased range of values). correlation may be excellent even when prediction of reference values by the surrogate is poor. thus, it is important to evaluate the ability of quicki to accurately predict insulin sensitivity as determined by the reference glucose clamp method. in the present study, we used a calibration model to compare the ability of quicki and other simple surrogates to predict si(clamp). predictive accuracy was evaluated by both root mean squared error of prediction as well as a more robust leave-one-out cross-validation-type root mean squared error of prediction (cvpe). based on data from 116 glucose clamps obtained from nonobese, obese, type 2 diabetic, and hypertensive subjects, we found that quicki and log (homeostasis model assessment [homa]) were both excellent at predicting si(clamp) (cvpe = 1.45 and 1.51, respectively) and significantly better than homa, 1/homa, and fasting insulin (cvpe = 3.17, p < 0.001; 1.67, p < 0.02; and 2.85, p < 0.001, respectively). quicki and log(homa) also had the narrowest distribution of residuals (measured si(clamp) - predicted si(clamp)). in a subset of subjects (n = 78) who also underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis, quicki was significantly better than the minimal model index of insulin sensitivity (si(mm)) at predicting si(clamp) (cvpe = 1.54 vs. 1.98, p = 0.001). we conclude that quicki and log(homa) are among the most accurate surrogate indexes for determining insulin sensitivity in humans.
factors which affect the depression of mothers with cerebral palsy child purpose. disability in a child affects not only the child's life but also the family's life. the aim of our study is to verify the quality of life (qol) of mothers of disabled children with cerebral palsy (cp) with epilepsy compared with non-epilepsy children evaluated in a brazilian center. methods. thirty mothers of disabled children participated in the study. the control group comprised of 18 healthy mothers of children without disabilities. all mothers agreed to participate in the study. they completed the evaluation forms of the sf-36 health survey, a well-documented, self-administered qol scoring system. results. the results of our study support the premise that mothers of children with cp, as a group, have poorer qol than mothers of not disabled children. conclusions. we also observed that mothers of children with cp and epilepsy have poorer qol than mothers of children with cp without epilepsy.
a small multifunctional pentatricopeptide repeat protein in the chloroplast of chlamydomonas reinhardtii. abstract chloroplast translation is mediated by nucleus-encoded factors that interact with distinct cis-acting rna elements. a u-rich sequence within the 5′ untranslated region of the psbd mrna has previously been shown to be required for its translation inchlamydomonas reinhardtii. by using uv cross-linking assays, we have identified a 40-kda rna binding protein, which binds to the wild-type psbd leader, but is unable to recognize a nonfunctional leader mutant lacking the u-rich motif. rna binding is restored in a chloroplast cis-acting suppressor. the functions of several site-directed psbd leader mutants were analyzed with transgenic c. reinhardtii chloroplasts and the in vitro rna binding assay. a clear correlation between photosynthetic activity and the capability to bind rna by the 40-kda protein was observed. furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the poly(u) region serves as a molecular spacer between two previously characterized cis-acting elements, which are involved in rna stabilization and translation. rna-protein complex formation depends on the nuclear nac2 gene product that is part of a protein complex required for the stabilization of the psbdmrna. the sedimentation properties of the 40-kda rna binding protein suggest that it interacts directly with this nac2 complex and, as a result, links processes of chloroplast rna metabolism and translation.
power aware chain routing protocol for data gathering in sensor networks networking together hundreds or thousands of cheap microsensor nodes allows users to accurately monitor a remote environment by intelligently combining the data from the individual nodes. these networks require robust wireless communication protocols that are energy efficient and provide low latency. we develop and analyze low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (leach), a protocol architecture for microsensor networks that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media access together with application-specific data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system lifetime, latency, and application-perceived quality. leach includes a new, distributed cluster formation technique that enables self-organization of large numbers of nodes, algorithms for adapting clusters and rotating cluster head positions to evenly distribute the energy load among all the nodes, and techniques to enable distributed signal processing to save communication resources. our results show that leach can improve system lifetime by an order of magnitude compared with general-purpose multihop approaches.
expression of an escherichia coli phosphoglucomutase in potato (solanum tuberosum l.) results in minor changes in tuber metabolism and a considerable delay in tuber sprouting patatin is one of the major soluble proteins in potato tubers and is encoded by a multigene family. based on structural considerations two classes of patatin genes are distinguished. the 5′‐upstream regulatory region of a class i gene contained within a 1.5 kb sequence is essential and sufficient to direct a high level of tuber‐specific gene activity which was on average 100‐ to 1000‐fold higher in tubers as compared to leaf, stem and roots in greenhouse grown transgenic potato plants when fused to the β‐glucuronidase reporter gene. histochemical analysis revealed this activity to be present in parenchymatic tissue but not in the peripheral phellem cells of transgenic tubers. furthermore the promoter fragment can be activated in leaves under conditions that simulate the need for the accumulation of starch in storage organs, i.e. high levels of sucrose. the expression is restricted to both mesophyll and epidermal cells in contrast to vascular tissue or hair cells.
molecular coevolution of the vertebrate cytochrome c the sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. these modifications are incorporated into a new program, clustal w which is freely available.
synergistic fermentation of camphor leaves by cellulolytic fungus and optimization of reducing sugar production a cellulase production process was developed by growing the fungi trichoderma reesei and aspergillus phoenicis on dairy manure. t. reesei produced a high total cellulase titer (1.7 filter paper units [fpu]/ml, filter paper activity) in medium containing 10 g/l of manure (dry basis [w/w]), 2 g/l kh2po4, 2 ml/l of tween-80, and 2mg/l of cocl2. however, β-glucosidase activity in the t. reesei-enzyme system was very low. t. reesei was then cocultured with a. phoenicis to enhance the β-glucosidase level. the mixed culture resulted in a relatively high level of total cellulase (1.54 fpu/ml) and β-glucosidase (0.64 iu/ml). the ratio of β-glucosidase activity to filter paper activity was 0.41, suitable for hydrolyzing manure cellulose. the crude enzyme broth from the mixed culture was used for hydrolyzing the manure cellulose, and the produced glucose was significantly (p<0.01) higher than levels obtained by using the commercial enzyme or the enzyme broth of the pure culture t. reesei.
strength training improves upper-limb function in individuals with stroke: a meta-analysis purpose: this paper reviews the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate force in individuals with stroke and summarizes the effects of strength training in these individuals. in addition, a systematic review of studies that have incorporated progressive strengthening interventions in individuals with stroke is presented. summary of key points: central (e.g., motor recruitment) and peripheral (e.g., muscle atrophy) sources may alter muscle strength in individuals with stroke and further investigations are needed to partition and quantify their effects. as to the effect of strength training interventions in individuals with stroke, the majority of studies (albeit with small samples) that evaluated muscle strength as an outcome demonstrated improvements. with regard to the effect of strength training on functional outcomes in individuals with stroke, positive outcomes were found in less rigorous pre-test/post-test studies, but more conflicting results with controlled trials. conclusions: although there is some suggestion that strength training alone can improve muscle strength, further research is required to optimize strength training and the transfer of these strength gains to functional tasks in individuals with stroke.
the influence of parent-child conflict and stressful experiences on the health of youth with asthma two hypotheses were tested: (a) one mechanism contributing to the high rate of disorder in children of women with affective disorders is elevated exposure to stressful events and conditions and (b) the children of depressed women, particularly women with unipolar depression, contribute to event occurrence because of increased interpersonal conflict. life stress interview assessments were made at 6-month intervals for 3 years on 53 children of unipolar, bipolar, medically ill, and normal women. both hypotheses were confirmed. transactional models of risk and further studies of the interpersonal functioning of children at risk for depression are needed.
bone mesenchymal stem cells attenuate radicular pain by inhibiting microglial activation in a rat noncompressive disk herniation model study design. autologous nucleus pulposus obtained from coccygeal intervertebral discs was grafted on the proximal of l5 dorsal root ganglion. pain behavior, mrna expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), and immunohistochemical changes were assessed. objective. the purpose of this study is to investigate temporal changes of il-8 expression in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion and the pain-related behaviors with time course and to elucidate whether repertaxin (il-8 receptor inhibitor) attenuates pain-related behaviors in a rat model of lumbar disc herniation. summary of background data. inflammatory mediators like cytokines and chemokines have been implicated in radicular pain because of disc herniation. il-8, known as cxcl8, is a chemokine, which has been reported to be associated with painful degenerative disc disorders and chronic inflammatory pain states. methods. lumbar disc herniated rat model was made by implantation of the autologous nucleus pulposus, harvested from the coccygeal vertebra of each tail, on the left l5 nerve root just proximal to thedorsal root ganglion. rats were tested for mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at 2 days before surgery, and on days 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 postoperatively. experimental group was intrathecally injected with the il-8 receptor inhibitor at l5 level on postoperative day 10. mechanical allodynia of the plantar surface of both hindpaw was tested on 30 minutes, 1, 3 hours, 1, 3, 5, and 10 days after administration. for the staining of astrocytes and microglia, immunohistochemical study was done 20 days after surgery. results. mechanical allodynia in ipsilateral hindpaw developed 1 day after surgery and lasted until 60 days and thermal withdrawal latency decreased significantly on the ipsilateral side 10 days after surgery and gradually increased through day 60. the il-8 receptor inhibitor attenuated the mechanical allodynia caused by nucleus pulposus when it was administered on postoperative day 10 and reduced microglial activation and phosphorylated form of mitogen-activated protein kinase (perk) expression in the spinal dorsal horn. conclusion. il-8 might be a potential therapeutic target in chronic radicular neuropathic pain because of disc herniation, cxcl8 inhibitor could be one of its promising therapeutic agents.
associations of urinary phthalate metabolites with residential characteristics, lifestyles, and dietary habits among young children in shanghai, china. phthalate esters (pes), bisphenol a (bpa), and parabens (pbs), which are used in numerous consumer products, are known for their endocrine disrupting properties. organophosphate chemicals (ops), which form the basis of the majority of pesticides, are known for their neurotoxic activity in humans. all of these chemicals are associated with health problems to which children are more susceptible. once they enter the human body, pes, bpa, pbs, and ops are metabolized and/or conjugated and finally excreted via urine. hence, human exposure to these substances is examined through a determination of the urinary concentrations of their metabolites. this study assessed the exposure of greek preschool-age children to pes, bpa, pbs, and ops by investigating the urinary levels of seven pes metabolites, six pbs, bpa, and six dialkyl phosphate metabolites in five-hundred samples collected from 4-year-old children, subjects of the "rhea" mother-child cohort in crete, greece. daily intake of endocrine disruptors, calculated for 4 year old children, was lower than the corresponding daily intake for 2.5 year old children, which were determined in an earlier study of the same cohort. in some cases the daily intake levels exceeded the u.s. environmental protection agency tolerable daily intake (tdi) values and the efsa reference doses (rfd) (e.g., for di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate, 3.6% and 1% of the children exceeded rfd and tdi, respectively). exposure was linked to three main sources: pes-bpa to plastic, pbs-diethyl phthalate to personal hygiene products, and ops to food.
cell-cell interactions during remodeling of the intestine at metamorphosis in xenopus laevis. thyroid hormone controls remodeling of the tadpole intestine during the climax of amphibian metamorphosis. in 8 days, the xenopus laevis tadpole intestine shortens in length by 75%. simultaneously, the longitudinal muscle fibers contract by about the same extent. the radial muscle fibers also shorten as the diameter narrows. many radial fibers undergo programmed cell death. we conclude that muscle remodeling and contraction play key roles in the shortening process. shortening is accompanied by a temporary "heaping" of the epithelial cells into many layers at climax. cells that face the lumen undergo apoptosis. by the end of metamorphosis, when the epithelium is folded into crypts and villi, the epithelium is a single-cell layer once again. throughout this remodeling, dna replication occurs uniformly throughout the epithelium, as do changes in gene expression. the larval epithelial cells as a whole, rather than a subpopulation of stem cells, are the progenitors of the adult epithelial cells.
difference in human cardiovascular response between upright and supine recovery from upright cycle exercise transitional changes in stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output resulting from head-up tilt were measured in healthy male subjects, using impedance cardiography. respiratory frequency, tidal volume, ventilation rate, end-tidal o2 and co2 tensions, o2 uptake, co2 output, and exchange ratio were also determined breath-by-breath. when the subject was tilted upward from a supine to an upright position, the stroke volume was decreased while the heart rate was increased. the time required to attain the steady state was shorter in the stroke volume change than in the heart rate. in addition, since the heart rate was not increased so high as to be inversely related to the stroke volume, the cardiac output decreased by tilting upward. the ventilation rate remained almost unchanged within a tilt angle of 60 degrees or so. thus, both the o2 and co2 fractions in expired air showed transitory changes. as the original body position was restored, the cardiac output was increased to the initial level, the tidal volume showing a transient increase. during the recovery process, pco2, in expired air increased and po2 decreased, showing that the change in cardiac output exceeded that in ventilation in quantity. the change in ventilation moreover, preceded that of expired pco2 by ca. 10 sec, suggesting that the enhancement of ventilation occurred through some agent(s) other than the chemical drive.
further validation of the pillbox test in a mixed clinical sample studies indicate that executive functioning (ef) is a strong predictor of everyday function. however, assessment can be problematic as no single standardized instrument is known to measure all ef domains simultaneously. thus, the pillbox test was developed as a new measure tapping four ef factors through the real-time assessment of medication management, a complex instrumental activity of daily living. the pillbox test showed good criterion-related validity and was effective in differentiating graduated levels of executive dysfunction between a mixed neurological group, medical control group, and healthy community control group. this test also showed good convergent validity as it correlated significantly in expected directions with established ef measures in all four of selected ef domains and the direct assessment of functional status. finally, a receiver operator characteristic curve found a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 87.5%, suggesting that the pillbox test is a promising new ecological measure of ef.
in vivo analysis of cell division, cell growth, and differentiation at the shoot apical meristem in arabidopsis article, publication date, and citation information can be found at www.plantcell.org/cgi/doi/10.1105/tpc.017962. controlled gene expression in time and space is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene function during plant development. here, we report ethanol inducible gene expression in defined sub-domains of the shoot apical and floral meristems. for this, expression of an ethanol-regulated transcription factor, alcr, is restricted to precise domains using specific promoters. gene expression activation is followed using reporters under the control of the alca promoter, which responds to alcr only in the presence of the ethanol. we demonstrate that precise control of spatially limited gene expression can be achieved. the kinetics of reporter gene activation and inactivation following a pulse of ethanol induction shows that the system is dynamic and suitable for precise temporal control of expression. the system is both flexible and robust, permitting simultaneous expression of two genes in a given domain or, conversely, the expression of a gene in two separate domains. we also show that this strategy can be applied to mis-express genes with developmental roles, by manipulating expression of the shoot meristemless (stm) and cyclin d3;1 (cycd3;1) genes during plant development.
variability of erythrocyte and serum lithium levels correlates with therapist treatment adherence efforts and maintenance treatment outcome background the effectiveness of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) in tricyclic resistant depression has received surprisingly little systematic study.   method patients who failed to respond to sustained, adequate treatment with the tricyclic imipramine (mean maximum dosage = 260 mg/day) and interpersonal psychotherapy were withdrawn from imipramine and treated in a standardized, but open-label 6-week trial with either phenelzine (n = 4; 60 mg/day) or tranylcypromine (n = 36; mean = 38.5 mg/day) and continued interpersonal psychotherapy.   results forty of 42 patients (95%) completed the trial, of whom 23 (58%) responded to treatment. highly significant improvement was documented on measures of depression, reversed neurovegetative symptoms, and somatic symptoms. response was significantly correlated with severity of depression (pre-maoi score on the hamilton rating scale for depression), severity of a composite score of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features, and low levels of improvement during initial imipramine/interpersonal psychotherapy. of patients who met criteria for proposed subforms of anergic or atypical depression, 67% (18/27) responded (p less than .05); 77% (17/22) of patients who scored above the mean on the composite measure of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features responded (p less than .01).   conclusion these findings provide strong evidence of the utility of maois in tricyclic-resistant depression, especially in patients with features such as fatigue, volitional inhibition, motoric retardation, hypersomnia, and/or weight gain.
coherent activity between brain regions that code for value is linked to the malleability of human behavior although persuasive messages often alter people's self-reported attitudes and intentions to perform behaviors, these self-reports do not necessarily predict behavior change. we demonstrate that neural responses to persuasive messages can predict variability in behavior change in the subsequent week. specifically, an a priori region of interest (roi) in medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) was reliably associated with behavior change (r = 0.49, p < 0.05). additionally, an iterative cross-validation approach using activity in this mpfc roi predicted an average 23% of the variance in behavior change beyond the variance predicted by self-reported attitudes and intentions. thus, neural signals can predict behavioral changes that are not predicted from self-reported attitudes and intentions alone. additionally, this is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging study to demonstrate that a neural signal can predict complex real world behavior days in advance.
a brief and preliminary look at snps data for some bering-chukchi-beaufort seas bowhead whales this journal frequently contains papers that report values of f-statistics estimated from genetic data collected from several populations. these parameters, fst, fit, and fis, were introduced by wright (1951), and offer a convenient means of summarizing population structure. while there is some disagreement about the interpretation of the quantities, there is considerably more disagreement on the method of evaluating them. different authors make different assumptions about sample sizes or numbers of populations and handle the difficulties of multiple alleles and unequal sample sizes in different ways. wright himself, for example, did not consider the effects of finite sample size. the purpose of this discussion is to offer some unity to various estimation formulae and to point out that correlations of genes in structured populations, with which f-statistics are concerned, are expressed very conveniently with a set of parameters treated by cockerham (1 969, 1973). we start with the parameters and construct appropriate estimators for them, rather than beginning the discussion with various data functions. the extension of cockerham's work to multiple alleles and loci will be made explicit, and the use of jackknife procedures for estimating variances will be advocated. all of this may be regarded as an extension of a recent treatment of estimating the coancestry coefficient to serve as a mea-
bimodal δ-opioid receptors regulate vagal bradycardia in canine sinoatrial node background: methionine-enkephalin-arginine-phenylalanine (meap) is an endogenous opiate derived from the c-terminal sequence of the larger precursor molecule proenkephalin. this heptapeptide is abundant in the myocardium and has significant vagolytic activity when infused systemically. meap interrupted vagal bradycardia when it was delivered directly into the sinoatrial node by local microdialysis. this study was conducted to determine the opioid receptor responsible for the vagolytic effect of meap. methods and results: microdialysis probes were placed in the sinoatrial node of mongrel dogs and perfused at 5 μl/min. increasing doses of meap were included in the nodal perfusate and approximately two thirds of the vagal bradycardia was inhibited with a maximal effect at 0.3 nmoles/μ,l and a half-maximal response near 0.1 nmoles/,ul. when deltorphin ii (a delta opioid receptor agonist) was infused into the sinoatrial node, more than 95% of the vagal bradycardia was eliminated at 0.3 nmoles/,ul with the half-maximal response near 0.1 nmoles/,l, indicating that deltorphin ii was more efficacious than meap. the maximal deltorphin ii and meap effects were both similarly reversed by the paired infusion of increasing doses of the 6 opiate receptor antagonist, naltrindole. selected, μ (endomorphin, super dalda) and κ (dynorphin, u50488) receptor agonists and,μ (ctap) and κ (norbni) receptor antagonists were completely ineffective in this system. conclusions: these data suggest that the vagolytic effect of meap involves the activation of delta opiate receptors within the sinoatrial node.

fuzzy memoization for floating-point multimedia applications power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. as a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. in addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. this paper presents wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. wattch is 1000x or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. this paper presents several validations of wattch's accuracy. in addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. we see wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. it also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar simplescalar framework.
a prospective stratified case-cohort study on statins and multiple adverse events in japan case-cohort data analyses often ignore valuable information on cohort members not sampled as cases or controls. the atherosclerosis risk in communities (aric) study investigators, for example, typically report data for just the 10%-15% of subjects sampled for substudies of their cohort of 15,972 participants. remaining subjects contribute to stratified sampling weights only. analysis methods implemented in the freely available r statistical system (http://cran.r-project.org/) make better use of the data through adjustment of the sampling weights via calibration or estimation. by reanalyzing data from an aric study of coronary heart disease and simulations based on data from the national wilms tumor study, the authors demonstrate that such adjustment can dramatically improve the precision of hazard ratios estimated for baseline covariates known for all subjects. adjustment can also improve precision for partially missing covariates, those known for substudy participants only, when their values may be imputed with reasonable accuracy for the remaining cohort members. links are provided to software, data sets, and tutorials showing in detail the steps needed to carry out the adjusted analyses. epidemiologists are encouraged to consider use of these methods to enhance the accuracy of results reported from case-cohort analyses.
how do doctors refer to patient-reported outcome measures (proms) in oncology consultations? purpose to examine the effects on process of care and patient well-being, of the regular collection and use of health-related quality-of-life (hrql) data in oncology practice.   patients and methods in a prospective study with repeated measures involving 28 oncologists, 286 cancer patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (regular completion of european organization for research and treatment of cancer-core quality of life questionnaire version 3.0, and hospital anxiety and depression scale on touch-screen computers in clinic and feedback of results to physicians); attention-control group (completion of questionnaires, but no feedback); or control group (no hrql measurement in clinic before encounters). primary outcomes were patient hrql over time, measured by the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general questionnaire, physician-patient communication, and clinical management, measured by content analysis of tape-recorded encounters. analysis employed mixed-effects modeling and multiple regression.   results patients in the intervention and attention-control groups had better hrql than the control group (p =.006 and p =.01, respectively), but the intervention and attention-control groups were not significantly different (p =.80). a positive effect on emotional well-being was associated with feedback of data (p =.008), but not with instrument completion (p =.12). a larger proportion of intervention patients showed clinically meaningful improvement in hrql. more frequent discussion of chronic nonspecific symptoms (p =.03) was found in the intervention group, without prolonging encounters. there was no detectable effect on patient management (p =.60). in the intervention patients, hrql improvement was associated with explicit use of hrql data (p =.016), discussion of pain, and role function (p =.046).   conclusion routine assessment of cancer patients' hrql had an impact on physician-patient communication and resulted in benefits for some patients, who had better hrql and emotional functioning.
the good, the bad, and the interested: how historical demographics explain present-day tree canopy, vacant lot and tree request spatial variability in new haven, ct in 2010 the american community survey (acs) replaced the long form of the united states decennial census. the acs is now the principal source of high-resolution geographic information about the u.s. population. the margins of error on acs census tract-level data are on average 75 percent larger than those of the corresponding 2000 long-form estimate. the practical implications of this increase is that data are sometimes so imprecise that they are difficult to use. this paper explains why the acs tract and block group estimates have large margins of error. statistical concepts are explained in plain english. acs margins of error are attributed to specific methodological decisions made by the census bureau. these decisions are best seen as compromises that attempt to balance financial constraints against concerns about data quality, timeliness, and geographic precision. in addition, demographic and geographic patterns in acs data quality are identified. these patterns are associated with demographic composition of census tracts. understanding the fundamental causes of uncertainty in the survey suggests a number of geographic strategies for improving the usability and quality acs.
hyperreactive airway disease in adults: data from a national study in lebanon. the aim of this study was to estimate the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on the aetiology of asthma. the classic twin study design was used to analyse data on self-reported asthma obtained by a questionnaire mailed to 34,076 individuals, aged 12-41 yrs and originating from the danish twin register. the cumulative incidence of asthma was 6.2% in the pooled sample. the data showed a decreasing cumulative incidence with age for males, but no sex or zygosity difference was observed. substantially higher concordance rates, odds ratios and correlations for asthma were estimated in the monozygotic than in the dizygotic twins. using biometric modelling, a model including additive genetic and nonshared environmental effects provided the best overall fit to the data. according to this model, 73% of the variation in liability to asthma was explained by genetic factors. no sex difference or age-dependency in the magnitude of genetic effects was observed. the biometric analysis emphasized a major influence of genetic factors in the aetiology of asthma. however, a substantial part of the variation in liability to asthma is due to the impact of environmental factors specific to the individual. there is no evidence for a substantial impact of genetic dominance or the shared environment.
restoration of vagal tone: a possible mechanism for functional abdominal pain objective: to present current concepts about the diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain and to review the basis of the therapeutic approach for this disease in children and adolescents. methods: references were obtained from the medline, from recent review articles, and from personal files. books and dissertations were also analyzed. only the most important articles were included in this review. results: recurrent abdominal pain is the main cause of recurrent pain in children between 4 and 16 years of age. it is defined as the occurrence of three or more abdominal pain attacks within 3 months or less. these attacks are severe enough to interrupt routine activities, making the child remain asymptomatic between the episodes of pain. the diagnosis is based on a detailed clinical history, on an improved physical examination, and on a few laboratory tests. it can be manifested with isolated paroxysms of umbilical pain, abdominal pain with dyspeptic symptoms, and abdominal pain with digestive tract dysfunction. the treatment must emphasize the cognitive-behavioral factors of the recurrent pain. conclusions: the treatment of recurrent abdominal pain using the strategy presented here represents an equilibrium in which time is neither wasted nor insufficient during the investigative process required for treating children and their families with this problem.
fatty acid reesterification but not oxidation is increased by oral contraceptive use in women. arterial-venous concentration differences for individual free fatty acids (ffa) were measured across the deep tissues of the forearm, the splanchnic vascular bed, and the kidney in healthy, postabsorptive subjects. in addition, arterial-portal venous ffa differences were determined in five patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. the differences in fractional uptake among the individual ffa across the forearm were small and not statistically significant. splanchnic fractional uptake was high for ffa with short chain lengths and rose with increasing degree of unsaturation. small, negative arterial-portal venous differences for individual ffa were observed, indicating that arterial-hepatic venous ffa differences mainly reflect hepatic uptake. when the arterial ffa concentration was reduced to approximately 25% of the control values by the administration of nicotinic acid, net uptake of total ffa ceased but there was release of stearic acid and uptake of lauric, myristic, and palmitoleic acid to the splanchnic region. muscle and liver uptakes of individual ffa were both dependent on their arterial concentrations with the exception of the splanchnic uptake of stearic acid. there was no uptake of free arachidonic acid by either muscle or liver, nor was there significant uptake of any of the free fatty acids by the kidney. it is concluded (a) that there are important quantitative differences between the net exchanges of individual ffa across the splanchnic vascular bed, (b) that tracer studies of ffa metabolism require the determination of individual ffa specific activities, (c) that palmitic and oleic acid appear to be suitable tracers for the entire ffa fraction in most instances.
antidiabetic and cytotoxicity screening of five medicinal plants used by traditional african health practitioners in the nelson mandela metropole, south africa. a tetrazolium salt has been used to develop a quantitative colorimetric assay for mammalian cell survival and proliferation. the assay detects living, but not dead cells and the signal generated is dependent on the degree of activation of the cells. this method can therefore be used to measure cytotoxicity, proliferation or activation. the results can be read on a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer (elisa reader) and show a high degree of precision. no washing steps are used in the assay. the main advantages of the colorimetric assay are its rapidity and precision, and the lack of any radioisotope. we have used the assay to measure proliferative lymphokines, mitogen stimulations and complement-mediated lysis.
the protooncogene c-myb increases the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor messenger rnas by a transcriptional mechanism. complementary dnas encoding mouse liver insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) have been isolated and sequenced. alternative rna splicing results in the synthesis of two types of mouse igf-i precursor that differ in the size and sequence of the cooh-terminal peptide. the sequences of the signal peptides, igf-i moieties and the first 16 amino acids of the cooh-terminal peptides or e-domains of the two precursors are identical. the sequence difference results from the presence in preproigf-ib mrna of a 52 base insertion which introduces a 17 amino acid segment into the cooh-terminal peptide of preproigf-ib and also causes a shift in the reading frame of the mrna. as a consequence of this insertion, the cooh-terminal 19 and 25 amino acids of mouse preproigf-ia and -ib, respectively, are different. the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ia are highly conserved and possess 94% identity. in contrast, the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ib are quite different in the region of the cooh-terminal peptide. a comparison of the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ib mrna indicates that they are generated by different molecular mechanisms.
the aspergillus nidulans f‐box protein grra links scf activity to meiosis backgroundthe construction of cdna libraries is a useful tool to understand gene expression in organisms under different conditions, but random sequencing of unbiased cdna collections is laborious and can give rise to redundant est collections.we aimed to isolate cdnas of messages induced by switching aspergillus nidulans from growth on glucose to growth on selected polysaccharides. approximately 4,700 contigs from 12,320 ests were already available from a cdna library representing transcripts isolated from glucose-grown a. nidulans during asexual development. our goals were to expand the cdna collection without repeated sequencing of previously identified ests and to find as many transcripts as possible that are specifically induced in complex polysaccharide metabolism.resultswe have devised a negative subtraction hybridization (nsh) method and tested it in a. nidulans. nsh entails screening a plasmid library made from cdnas prepared from cells grown under a selected physiological condition with labeled cdna probes prepared from another physiological condition. plasmids with inserts that failed to hybridize to cdna probes through two rounds of screening (i.e. negatives) indicate that they are transcripts present at low concentration in the labeled probe pool. thus, these transcripts will be predominantly condition-specific, along with some rare transcripts.in a screen for transcripts induced by switching the carbon source from glucose to 12 selected polysaccharides, 3,532 negatives were isolated from approximately 100,000 surveyed colonies using this method. negative clones were end-sequenced and assembled into 2,039 contigs, of which 1,722 were not present in the previously characterized glucose-grown cdna library. single-channel microarray hybridization experiments confirmed that the majority of the negatives represented genes that were differentially induced by a switch from growth in glucose to one or more of the polysaccharides.conclusionsthe negative subtraction hybridization method described here has several practical benefits. this method can be used to screen any existing cdna library, including full-length and pooled libraries, and does not rely on pcr or sequence information. in addition, nsh is a cost-effective method for the isolation of novel, full-length cdnas for differentially expressed transcripts or enrichment of rare transcripts.
diagnosis of intestinal amoebiasis by using nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay a small number of entamoeba isolates from humans, the best known of which is the 'laredo' strain, have the ability to grow at room temperature. this peculiarity, along with other characteristics, distinguishes the strains from the human pathogen e. histolytica despite their being morphologically inseparable. in contrast, these 'e. histolytica-like' strains share several features with e. moshkovskii, which is most frequently isolated from polluted water. to examine the taxonomic relationships among these morphologically similar organisms, we have used polymerase chain reaction amplification of the small subunit ribosomal rna gene combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, 'riboprinting'. the results clearly show that the 'e. histolytica-like' amoebae are indeed strains of e. moshkovskii, and not closely related to e. histolytica.
normally-off stt-mram cache with zero-byte compression for energy efficient last-level caches spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (stt-mram) is a promising memory technology because of its advantageous features, such as nonvolatility, scalability, high density, zero-leakage, and cmos compatibility. however, one of its major drawbacks is the high overall energy consumption. to make matters even worse, the write process in stt-mram is of stochastic nature, i.e., the completion of a write operation is nondeterministic. however, if the read/write completion could be detected on the fly (i.e., dynamically) and the respective components could be turned-off immediately, the energy consumption can be reduced by a large extent. therefore, we propose a technique where the read and write completion signals are generated asynchronously on the fly using a self-timed bitwise technique. with this approach, the memory consumes power only when it is in the actual operational mode. experimental results show that this technique significantly reduces the energy consumption of read and write operations with negligible area overhead.
change of muscle activation patterns in uphill cycling of varying slope despite the wide use of surface electromyography (emg) to study pedalling movement, there is a paucity of data concerning the muscular activity during uphill cycling, notably in standing posture. the aim of this study was to investigate the muscular activity of eight lower limb muscles and four upper limb muscles across various laboratory pedalling exercises which simulated uphill cycling conditions. ten trained cyclists rode at 80% of their maximal aerobic power on an inclined motorised treadmill (4%, 7% and 10%) with using two pedalling postures (seated and standing). two additional rides were made in standing at 4% slope to test the effect of the change of the hand grip position (from brake levers to the drops of the handlebar), and the influence of the lateral sways of the bicycle. for this last goal, the bicycle was fixed on a stationary ergometer to prevent the lean of the bicycle side-to-side. emg was recorded from m. gluteus maximus (gm), m. vastus medialis (vm), m. rectus femoris (rf), m. biceps femoris (bf), m. semimembranosus (sm), m. gastrocnemius medialis (gas), m. soleus (sol), m. tibialis anterior (ta), m. biceps brachii (bb), m. triceps brachii (tb), m. rectus abdominis (ra) and m. erector spinae (es). unlike the slope, the change of pedalling posture in uphill cycling had a significant effect on the emg activity, except for the three muscles crossing the ankle's joint (gas, sol and ta). intensity and duration of gm, vm, rf, bf, bb, ta, ra and es activity were greater in standing while sm activity showed a slight decrease. in standing, global activity of upper limb was higher when the hand grip position was changed from brake level to the drops, but lower when the lateral sways of the bicycle were constrained. these results seem to be related to (1) the increase of the peak pedal force, (2) the change of the hip and knee joint moments, (3) the need to stabilize pelvic in reference with removing the saddle support, and (4) the shift of the mass centre forward.
modeling prehension for physical collaboration in virtual environments earlier studies have suggested that the size of an object to be grasped influences the time taken to complete a prehensile movement. however, the use of cylindrical objects in those studies confounded the effects of object size — extent orthogonal to the reach axis — and object width — extent along the reach axis. in separating these effects, the present study demonstrates that movement time is not affected by manipulation of object size, as long as the latter does not approach the maximal object size that can be grasped. object width, on the other hand, is shown to exert a systematic influence on movement time: smaller object widths give rise to longer movement times through a lengthening of the deceleration phase of the movement, thus reproducing the effect of target width on the kinematics of aiming movements. as in aiming, movement amplitude also affects the movement time in prehension, influencing primarily the acceleration phase (i.e. peak velocity attained). the effects of object width and movement amplitude were found to combine in a way predicted by fitts' law, allowing a generalisation of the latter to the transport component in prehensile actions. with respect to the grasp component, both object size and object width are shown to affect peak hand aperture. increasing object width thus lowers the spatial accuracy demands on the transport component, permitting a faster movement to emerge. at the same time, the hand opens to a larger grip in order to compensate for eventual directional errors that result. finally, with respect to the control mode of the grasp component, it was found that peak finger closing velocity scales to distance to be covered, defined as the peak hand aperture minus object size.
i‐prune: item selection for associative classification previous studies propose that associative classification has high classification accuracy and strong flexibility at handling unstructured data. however, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification is based on only a single high-confidence rule. the authors propose a new associative classification method, cmar, i.e., classification based on multiple association rules. the method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, fp-growth, constructs a class distribution-associated fp-tree, and mines large databases efficiently. moreover, it applies a cr-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. the classification is performed based on a weighted /spl chi//sup 2/ analysis using multiple strong association rules. our extensive experiments on 26 databases from the uci machine learning database repository show that cmar is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with cba and c4.5. moreover, our performance study shows that the method is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported associative classification methods.
knowledge graph exploration for natural language understanding in web information retrieval an empirical evaluation of models of text document similarity michael d. lee (michael.lee@adelaide.edu.au) department of psychology, university of adelaide south australia, 5005, australia brandon pincombe (brandon.pincombe@dsto.defence.gov.au) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance division, defence science and technology organisation po box 1500, edinburgh sa 5111 australia matthew welsh (matthew.welsh@adelaide.edu.au) australian school of petroleum engineering, university of adelaide south australia, 5005, australia abstract modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments presents a significant theoretical challenge for cognitive science, with ready-made applications in in- formation handling and decision support systems deal- ing with text. while a number of candidate models exist, they have generally not been assessed in terms of their ability to emulate human judgments of simi- larity. to address this problem, we conducted an ex- periment that collected repeated similarity measures for each pair of documents in a small corpus of short news documents. an analysis of human performance showed inter-rater correlations of about 0.6. we then considered the ability of existing models—using word- based, n-gram and latent semantic analysis (lsa) approaches—to model these human judgments. the best performed lsa model produced correlations of about 0.6, consistent with human performance, while the best performed word-based and n-gram models achieved correlations closer to 0.5. many of the re- maining models showed almost no correlation with hu- man performance. based on our results, we provide some discussion of the key strengths and weaknesses of the models we examined. introduction modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments is an interesting problem for cognitive science, for both theoretical and practical reasons. theoret- ically, it involves the study of a basic cognitive pro- cess with richly structured natural stimuli. practically, search engines, text corpus visualizations, and a vari- ety of other applications for filtering, sorting, retriev- ing, and generally handling text rely fundamentally on similarity measures. for this reason, the ability to as- sess semantic similarity in an accurate, automated, and scalable way is a key determinant of the effectiveness of most information handling and decision support soft- ware that deals with text. a variety of different approaches have been devel- oped for modeling text document similarity. these in- clude simple word-based, keyword-based and n-gram measures (e.g., salton, 1989; damashek, 1995), and more complicated approaches such as latent seman- tic analysis (lsa: deerwester et al., 1990; landauer and dumais, 1997). while all of these approaches have achieved some level of practical success, they have gen- erally not been assessed in terms of their ability to model human judgments of text document similarity. the most likely reason for this failure is that no suit- able empirical data exist, and considerable effort is in- volved in collecting pairwise ratings of text document similarity for even a moderate number of documents. this paper reports the collection of data that give ten independent ratings of the similarity of every pair of 50 short text documents, and so represents an attempt to establish a ‘psychological ground truth’ for evaluating models. using the new data, we report a first eval- uation of the ability of word-based, n-gram and lsa approaches to model human judgments. experiment materials the text corpus evaluated by human judges contained 50 documents selected from the australian broadcast- ing corporation’s news mail service, which provides text e-mails of headline stories. the documents varied in length from 51 to 126 words, and covered a number of broad topics. a further 314 documents from the same were collected to act as a larger ‘backgrounding’ corpus for lsa. both document sets were assessed against a stan- dard corpus of five english texts using four models of language. these were the log-normal, generalized in- verse gauss-poisson (with γ = −0.5), yule-simon and zipfian models (baayen, 2001). both document sets were within the normal range of english text for word frequency spectrum and vocabulary growth and were therefore regarded as representative of normal english texts. subjects the subjects were 83 university of adelaide students (29 males and 54 females), with a mean age of 19.7 years. they were each paid with a ten (australian) dollar gift voucher for every 100 document pair ratings made.
how functionalist and process approaches to behavior can explain trait covariation. in a large community sample (n=490), the big five were not orthogonal when modeled as latent variables representing the shared variance of reports from 4 different informants. additionally, the standard higher-order factor structure was present in latent space: neuroticism (reversed), agreeableness, and conscientiousness formed one factor, labeled stability, and extraversion and openness/intellect formed a second factor, labeled plasticity. comparison of two instruments, the big five inventory and the mini-markers, supported the hypotheses that single-adjective rating instruments are likely to yield lower interrater agreement than phrase rating instruments and that lower interrater agreement is associated with weaker correlations among the big five and a less coherent higher-order factor structure. in conclusion, an interpretation of the higher-order factors is discussed, including possible neurobiological substrates.
development of transcriptional fusions to assess leptospira interrogans promoter activity computational methods for automated genome annotation are critical to understanding and interpreting the bewildering mass of genomic sequence data presently being generated and released. a neural network model of the structural and compositional properties of a eukaryotic core promoter region has been developed and its application for analysis of the drosophila melanogaster genome is presented. the model uses a time-delay architecture, a special case of a feed-forward neural network. the structure of this model allows for variable spacing between functional binding sites, which is known to play a key role in the transcription initiation process. application of this model to a test set of core promoters not only gave better discrimination of potential promoter sites than previous statistical or neural network models, but also revealed indirectly subtle properties of the transcription initiation signal. when tested in the adh region of 2.9 mbases of the drosophila genome, the neural network for promoter prediction (nnpp) program that incorporates the time-delay neural network model gives a recognition rate of 75% (69/92) with a false positive rate of 1/547 bases. the present work can be regarded as one of the first intensive studies that applies novel gene regulation technologies to the identification of the complex gene regulation sites in the genome of drosophila melanogaster.
on the role of the wideband inhibitor in the dorsal cochlear nucleus: a computational modeling study this paper presents a computational model to simulate normal and impaired auditory-nerve (an) fiber responses in cats. the model responses match physiological data over a wider dynamic range than previous auditory models. this is achieved by providing two modes of basilar membrane excitation to the inner hair cell (ihc) rather than one. the two modes are generated by two parallel filters, component 1 (c1) and component 2 (c2), and the outputs are subsequently transduced by two separate functions. the responses are then added and passed through the ihc low-pass filter followed by the ihc-an synapse model and discharge generator. the c1 filter is a narrow-band, chirp filter with the gain and bandwidth controlled by a nonlinear feed-forward control path. this filter is responsible for low and moderate level responses. a linear, static, and broadly tuned c2 filter followed by a nonlinear, inverted and nonrectifying c2 transduction function is critical for producing transition region and high-level effects. consistent with kiang's two-factor cancellation hypothesis, the interaction between the two paths produces effects such as the c1/c2 transition and peak splitting in the period histogram. the model responses are consistent with a wide range of physiological data from both normal and impaired ears for stimuli presented at levels spanning the dynamic range of hearing.
regulation of gene expression in hepatic cells by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) the gene expression omnibus (geo) project was initiated in response to the growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data. geo provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. geo is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. the three central data entities of geo are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. a platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. a sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. a series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. the geo repository is publicly accessible through the world wide web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.
measurement, modelling and evaluation of computing systems we consider the optimal energy-aware control of a single server in a server farm. the server is modeled as an m/g/1 queue with a particular control policy that allows to put the server to a sleep mode to save energy with an additional delay cost, the setup delay, after the server is turned on again. our main result is the derivation of mean response time for such a system under srpt scheduling. in particular, we show that the mean response time can be decomposed into two parts: the mean response time of an ordinary m/g/1-srpt, and an additional penalty term for switching the server to a sleep state. furthermore, we study the energy-performance optimization of the system and prove that, for the energy response time weighted sum (erws) and energy response time product (erp) cost metrics, the optimal control either puts the server into a sleep state immediately when it becomes idle or keeps it idling until the next job arrives.
the recognition of mental illness, schizophrenia identification, and help-seeking from friends in late adolescence backgroundsurveys of the public in a number of countries have shown poor recognition of mental disorders and beliefs about treatment that often diverge from those of health professionals. this lack of mental health literacy can limit the optimal use of treatment services. australia and japan are countries with very different mental health care systems, with japan emphasising hospital care and australia more oriented to community care. japan is also more collectivist and australia more individualist in values. these differences might influence recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment in the two countries.methodssurveys of the public were carried out in each country using as similar a methodology as feasible. in both countries, household interviews were carried out concerning beliefs in relation to one of four case vignettes, describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia. in australia, the survey involved a national sample of 3998 adults aged 18 years or over. in japan, the survey involved 2000 adults aged between 20 and 69 from 25 regional sites spread across the country.resultsthe japanese public were found to be more reluctant to use psychiatric labels, particularly for the depression cases. the japanese were also more reluctant to discuss mental disorders with others outside the family. they had a strong belief in counsellors, but not in gps. they generally believe in the benefits of treatment, but are not optimistic about full recovery. by contrast, australians used psychiatric labels more often, particularly "depression". they were also more positive about the benefits of seeking professional help, but had a strong preference for lifestyle interventions and tended to be negative about some psychiatric medications. australians were positive about both counsellors and gps. psychiatric hospitalization and ect were seen negatively in both countries.conclusionthere are some major differences between australia and japan in recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment. some of these may relate to the different health care systems, but the increasing openness about mental health in australia is also likely to be an explanatory factor.
tetrad gravity: ii) dirac's observables in the present article the geometry of semi-riemannian manifolds with nonholonomic constraints is studied. these manifolds can be considered as analogues to the sub-riemannian manifolds, where the positive definite metric is substituted by a nondegenerate metric. we study properties of the exponential map, the christoffel symbols and other differential operators are introduced. we study solutions of the hamiltonian system and their projections into the underlying manifold. the explicit formulae were found for a specific example of a semi-riemannian manifold with nonholonomic constraints.
the ubiquitous distribution of late embryogenesis abundant proteins across cell compartments in arabidopsis offers tailored protection against abiotic stress[c][w][open] few organisms are able to withstand desiccation stress; however, desiccation tolerance is widespread among plant seeds. survival without water relies on an array of mechanisms, including the accumulation of stress proteins such as the late embryogenesis abundant (lea) proteins. these hydrophilic proteins are prominent in plant seeds but also found in desiccation-tolerant organisms. in spite of many theories and observations, lea protein function remains unclear. here, we show that leam, a mitochondrial lea protein expressed in seeds, is a natively unfolded protein, which reversibly folds into α-helices upon desiccation. structural modeling revealed an analogy with class a amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins that coat low-density lipoprotein particles in mammals. leam appears spontaneously modified by deamidation and oxidation of several residues that contribute to its structural features. leam interacts with membranes in the dry state and protects liposomes subjected to drying. the overall results provide strong evidence that leam protects the inner mitochondrial membrane during desiccation. according to sequence analyses of several homologous proteins from various desiccation-tolerant organisms, a similar protection mechanism likely acts with other types of cellular membranes.
ocular dominance in extrastriate cortex of strabismic amblyopic cats abstract kittens are born with a large divergent strabismus. fourteen kittens observed daily from birth concurrently developed both visually guided behavior and normal interocular alignment during the second postnatal month. (interocular alignment is defined as the angle formed by the visual axes.) once achieved, this normal interocular alignment is resistant to a number if alterations in the cat's visual input. two cats with adult eyelid closure (one binocular, one monocular), 3 cats with adult unilateral visual cortex ablations, and 3 cats with adult transection of the optic chiasm along the sagittal midline did not develop strabismus. however, all 5 kittens reared with binocular eyelid closure and 9 of 10 reared with monocular eyelid closure developed a stable strabismus. the former all displayed a similar divergent strabismus whereas strabismus in the latter covered a wide range of interocular misalignments. a purely mechanical explanation is discarded sinceboth eyes of cats reared with monocular closure were similarly misaligned. these results indicate that cats require a normal, binocular visual environment during development to achieve the proper interocular alignment. it is hypothesized that during normal development, the binocular patterned visual input stimulates some part or parts of the cat's visual system to align the eyes properly. binocular closure results in no patterned stimulation, so the eyes remain diverged. monocular closure allows patterned stimulation through the open eye, and this initiates alignment which results in a wide range of errors due to the lack of data from the closed eye. apparently the visual system does not require the visual cortex for this alignment since 3 kittens reared with extensive visual cortex ablations made during the 8th postnatal day demonstrated the normal development of both visually guided behavior and interocular alignment.
associations of family-centered care with health care outcomes for children with special health care needs measurements of continuous variables are made in all branches of medicine, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. in clinical practice it is helpful to label individuals as having or not having an attribute, such as being “hypertensive” or “obese” or having “high cholesterol,” depending on the value of a continuous variable.  categorisation of continuous variables is also common in clinical research, but here such simplicity is gained at some cost. though grouping may help data presentation, notably in tables, categorisation is unnecessary for statistical analysis and it has some serious drawbacks. here we consider the impact of converting continuous data to two groups (dichotomising), as this is the most common approach in clinical research.1  what are the perceived advantages of forcing all individuals into two groups? a common argument is that it greatly simplifies the statistical analysis and leads to easy interpretation and presentation of results. a …
the evolution of self-control class does not exist either, precisely since the relation between the two shadows compared is not a relation of simple comparison and common appurtenance to the same totality, but of substantial participation. the shadow perceived on the table is therefore no more an isolable object than is, on the sensorimotor plane, the watch which disappears under one cushion and which the child expects to see appear under another. but if there is thus an apparent return to the past it is for an opposite reason to that which obstructs objectification in sensorimotor intelligence; in the latter case the object is difficult to form in proportion as the child has difficulty in intercoordinating perceptual images, whereas on the plane of conceptual thought the object, already elaborated, again loses its identity to the extent that it is coordinated with other objects to construct a class or a relation. in conclusion, in the case of the object as in that of space, from the very beginnings of verbal reflection there is a return of the difficulties already overcome on the plane of action, and there is repetition, with temporal displacements, of the stages and process of adaptation defined by the transition from egocentrism to objectivity. and in both cases the phenomenon is due to the difficulties experienced by the child, after he has reached the social plane, in inserting his sensorimotor acquisitions in a framework of relationships of logical classes and deductive structures admitting of true generalisation, that is, taking into account the point of view of others and all possible points of view as well as his own. § 4. from sensori-motor universe to representation of the child’s world ii. causality and time the development of causality from the first months of life to the eleventh or twelfth year reveals the same graphic curve as that of space or object. the acquisition of causality seems to be completed with the formation of sensorimotor intelligence; in the measure that objectification and spatialisation of relations of cause and effect succeed the magico-phenomenalistic egocentrism of the primitive connections, a whole evolution resumes with the advent of speech and representative thought which seems to reproduce the preceding evolution before really extending it. but among the displacements to which this history of the concept of cause gives rise, distinction must again be made between the simple temporal displacements in extension due to the repetition of primitive processes on the occasion of new problems analogous to old ones, and the temporal displacements in comprehension due to the transition from one plane of activity to another; that is, from the plane of action to that of representation. it seems useless to us to emphasise the former. nothing is more natural than the fact that belief in the efficacy of personal activity, a belief encouraged by chance comparisons through immediate or phenomenalistic experience, is again found throughout childhood in those moments of anxiety or of desire which characterise infantile magic. the second type of temporal displacements, however, raises questions which it is useful to mention here. during the first months of life the child does not dissociate the external world from his own activity. perceptual images, not yet consolidated into objects or coordinated in a coherent space, seem to him to be governed by his desires and efforts, though these are not attributed to a self which is separate from the universe. then gradually, as progress is made in the intelligence which elaborates objects and space by spinning a tight web of relations among these images, the child attributes an autonomous causality to things and persons and conceives of the existence of causal relations independent of himself, his own body becoming a source among other sources of effects integrated in this total system. what will happen when, through speech and representative thought, the subject succeeds not only in foreseeing the development of phenomena and in acting upon them but in evoking them apart from any action in order to try to explain them? it is here that the paradox of displacement in comprehension appears. by virtue of the "why" obsessing the child’s mind, as soon as his representation of the world can be detached without too much risk of error, one perceives that this universe, centred on the self, which seemed abolished because it was eliminated from practical action relating to the immediate environment, reappears on the plane of thought and impresses itself on the little child as the sole understandable conception of totality. undoubtedly the child no longer behaves, as did the baby, as though he commanded everything and everybody. he knows that adults have their own will, that the rain, wind, clouds, stars, and all things are characterised by movements and effects he undergoes but cannot control. in short, on the practical plane, the objectification and spatialisation of causality remain acquired. but this does not at all prevent the child from representing the universe to himself as a large machine, organised exactly by whom he does not know, but organised with the help of adults and for the sake of the well-being of men and particularly of children. just as in a house everything is arranged according to a plan, despite imperfections and partial failures, so also the raison d’être for everything in the physical universe is the function of a sort of order in the world, an order both material and moral, of which the child is the center. adults are there "to take care of us," animals to do us service, the stars to warm us and give us light, plants to nourish us, rain to make the gardens grow, clouds to "make night," mountains to climb on, and lakes for boats, etc. furthermore, to this more or less explicit and coherent artificialism there corresponds a latent animism which endows everything with the will to play its role and with just the force and awareness needed to act with regularity. thus the causal egocentrism, which on the sensorimotor plane disappears gradually under the influence of spatialisation and objectification, reappears from the time of the beginnings of thought in almost as radical a form. doubtless the child no longer attributes personal causality to others or to things, but while endowing objects with specific activities he centers all these activities on man and above all on himself. it seems clear that in this sense we may speak of temporal displacement from one plane to another and that the phenomenon is thus comparable to the phenomena which characterise the evolution of space and object. but it is in a still deeper sense that the primitive schemata of causality are again transposed in the child’s first reflective representations. if it is true that from the second year of life the child attributes causality to others and to objects instead of reserving a monopoly on them for his own activity, we have still to discover how he represents to himself the mechanism of these causal relations. we have just recalled that corresponding to the egocentric artificialism which makes the universe gravitate around man and child is an animism capable of explaining the activity of creatures and things in this sort of world. this example is precisely of a kind to help us understand the second kind of temporal displacement of which we now speak: if the child renounces considering his actions as the cause of every event, he nevertheless is unable to represent to himself the action of bodies except by means of schemata drawn from his own activity. an object animated by a "natural" movement like the wind which pushes clouds, or the moon which advances, thus seems endowed with purposefulness and finality, for the child is unable to conceive of an action without a conscious goal. through lack of awareness, every process involving a relation of energies, such as the rising of the water level in a glass in which a pebble has been dropped, seems due to forces copied from the model of personal activity; the pebble "weighs" on the bottom of the water, it "forces" the water to rise, and if one held the pebble on a string midway of the column of the water the level would not change. in short, even though there is objectivity on the practical plane, causality may remain egocentric from the representative point of view to the extent that the first causal conceptions are drawn from the completely subjective consciousness of the activity of the self. with regard to spatialisation of the causal connection the same temporal displacement between representation and action is observable. thus the child can acknowledge in practice the necessity for a spatial contact between cause and effect, but that does not make causality geometric or mechanical. for example, the parts of a bicycle all seem necessary to the child long before he thinks of establishing irreversible causal series among them. however, subsequent to these primitive stages of representation during which one sees reappear on the plane of thought forms of causality relative to those of the first sensorimotor stages and which seem surpassed by the causal structures of the final stages of sensorimotor intelligence, one witnesses a truly reflective objectification and spatialisation, whose progress is parallel to that which we have described on the plane of action. thus it is that subsequent to the animism and dynamism we have just mentioned, we see a gradual "mechanism" taking form, correlative to the principles of conservation described in § 3 and to the elaboration of a relative space. causality, like the other categories, therefore evolves on the plane of thought from an initial egocentrism to a combined objectivity and relativity, thus reproducing, in surpassing, its earlier sensorimotor evolution. with regard to time, concerning which we have tried to describe on the purely practical plane of the first two years of life the transformation from
excimer laser-assisted recanalisation of femoral arterial stenosis or occlusion caused by the use of angio-seal purpose: given the increasing number of percutaneously applied endovascular therapies, the incidence of access-related vascular complications can be expected to rise, particularly in association with those techniques requiring large sheaths or anticoagulation. the need exists for a safe, easy to use, and effective hemostatic technique to replace the labor-intensive method of manual compression. methods: a bioabsorbable, sheath-delivered vascular closure device (angio-seal™) has been developed that deposits a small collagen plug within the arterial wall to mechanically seal the puncture defect. an anchor connected by suture to the plug is first deployed in the arterial lumen and pulled flush against the interior arterial wall to guard against intraluminal deposition of the collagen. results: the angio-seal device was deployed successfully in 80 (96%) of 83 attempts involving common femoral arteries accessed for peripheral angioplasty (n = 30), coronary angiography (n = 30), and coronary angioplasty (n = 16). three popliteal artery access sites and one femoropopliteal bypass graft were also treated. hemostasis was immediate in 78 cases (98%); 2 sites required a 5-minute manual compression to effect a secure seal. three devices failed to deploy, and manual pressure was used to close the puncture. nondeployment did not cause any sequelae, and no complications were encountered with the technique. conclusions: this novel vascular closure device is quick (< 1 minute application time) and simple to use, providing a positive seal of common femoral artery puncture sites for both peripheral and coronary interventions. it appears to be a reliable alternative to standard manual hemostasis.
investigation of internal pressure gradients generated in electrokinetic flows with axial conductivity gradients in particle image velocimetry experiments where optical access is limited or in microscale geometries, it may be desirable to illuminate the entire test section with a volume of light, as opposed to a two-dimensional sheet of light. with volume illumination, the depth of the measurement plane must be defined by the focusing characteristics of the recording optics. a theoretical expression for the depth of the two-dimensional measurement plane is derived and it is shown to agree well with experimental observations. unfocused particle images, which lie outside the measurement plane, create background noise that decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the particle-image fields. results show that the particle concentration must be chosen judiciously in order to balance the desired spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the particle-image field.
for semi-supervised bilingual acoustic model training although phonetic lexicons are critical for many speech applications, the process of building one for a new language can take a significant amount of time and effort. we present a bootstrapping algorithm to build phonetic lexicons for new languages. our method relies on a large amount of unlabeled text, a small set of ’seed words’ with their phonetic transcription, and the proficiency of a native speaker in correctly inspecting the generated pronunciations of the words. the method proceeds by automatically building letter-to-sound (lts) rules from a small set of the most commonly occurring words in a large corpus of a given language. these lts rules are retrained as new words are added to the lexicon in an active learning step. this procedure is repeated until we have a lexicon that can predict the pronunciation of any word in the target language with the accuracy desired. we tested our approach for three languages: english,
cytokine-induced nuclear factor kappa b activation promotes the survival of developing neurons nf-kappa b, which consists of two polypeptides, p50 (m(r) 50k) and p65/rela (m(r) 65k), is thought to be a key regulator of genes involved in responses to infection, inflammation and stress. indeed, although developmentally normal, mice deficient in p50 display functional defects in immune responses. here we describe the generation of mice deficient in the rela subunit of nf-kappa b. disruption of the rela locus leads to embryonic lethality at 15-16 days of gestation, concomitant with a massive degeneration of the liver by programmed cell death or apoptosis. embryonic fibroblasts from rela-deficient mice are defective in the tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-mediated induction of messenger rnas for i kappa b alpha and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), although basal levels of these transcripts are unaltered. these results indicate that rela controls inducible, but not basal, transcription in nf-kappa b-regulated pathways.
what clinical characteristics and radiographic parameters are associated with patellofemoral instability after kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty? rotational mismatch of the tibial component on the femoral component within 0°±10° is associated with better function after mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty (tka). kinematically aligned tka has gained interest; however, the percentage of kinematically aligned tka within 0°±10° is unknown. the authors prospectively followed all patients who underwent tka for primary osteoarthritis between december 2011 and april 2012 (194 patients, 195 knees). each underwent kinematically aligned tka with manual instruments. aligning the anteroposterior axis of the tibial component parallel to the line that bisects the oval boundary of the lateral tibial condyle set internal/external rotation. removing bone from the posterior femoral condyles equal in thickness to the femoral component after correction for cartilage wear set internal/external rotation and anteroposterior translation of the femoral component. rotational mismatch of the tibial component on the femoral component was determined from a computed tomography scan of the knee. ninety-seven percent of kinematically aligned tka with fixed-bearing components had a rotational mismatch within 0°±10° (overall range, -11° to 11°). this percentage was higher and the range narrower than the 85% of tka within 0°±10° and the -14° to 16° range reported for mechanically aligned tka. the use of manual instruments to kinematically aligned tka reliably limited rotational mismatch to within 0°±10°, which has been associated with better function.
health-related and social factors predicting non-reemployment amongst newly unemployed the center for epidemiologic studies-depression scale (ces-d; l. s. radloff, 1977) assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms occurring over the past week. although it contains only 20 items, its length may preclude its use in a variety of clinical populations. this study evaluated psychometric properties of 2 shorter forms of the ces-d developed by f. j. kohout, l. f. berkman, d. a. evans, and j. cornoni-huntley (1993): the iowa form and the boston form. data were pooled from 832 women representing 6 populations. internal consistency estimates, correlations with the original version of the ces-d, and omitted-included item correlations supported use of the iowa form over the boston form when a shortened version of the scale is desired. regression statistics are provided for use in estimating scores on the original ces-d when either shortened form is used. factor analytic results from two populations support a single-factor structure for the original ces-d as well as the short forms.
dynamic load response of the lumbar spine in flexion the ultimate strength in flexion of 16 lumbar functional spinal units (fsu) was determined. the specimens were exposed to a combined static load of bending and shearing in the sagittal plane until overt rupture occurred (simulated flexion-distraction injuries). the biomechanical response of the fsu was measured with a force and moment platform. mechanical displacement gauges were used to measure vertical displacements (flexion angulation) of the specimens. photographs were taken after each loading step for determination of horizontal displacements and the centre of rotation. the lumbar fsu could resist a combination of bending moment and shear force of 156 nm and 620 n respectively, before complete disruption occurred. the tension force acting on the posterior structures was 2.8 kn. the flexion angulation just before failure was 20 degrees and the anterior horizontal displacement between the upper and lower vertebrae was 9 mm. the centre of rotation was located in the posterior part of the lower vertebral body. the bone mineral content in the vertebrae appeared to be a good predictor of ultimate strength of the lumbar fsu. knowledge of the biomechanical response of the lumbar spine under different static traumatic loads is a first step to better understand the injury mechanisms of the spine in traffic accidents.
rapidly expanding host range for puccinia psidii sensu lato in australia uredo rangelii (myrtle rust) is reported for the first time in australia — detected on 22 april 2010 — from agonis flexuosa, callistemon viminalis and syncarpia glomulifera. this taxon is morphologically distinct from puccinia psidii, the cause of guava rust, but dna sequence data place it in the p. psidii complex. surveys up to the end of may 2010 have detected u. rangelii on cultivated shrubs and trees at four properties (two cut flower farms and two wholesale nurseries) on the central coast of new south wales, with no records in native forest thus far. containment operations are currently underway on infected properties.
echocardiographic predictors for worsening of six-minute walk distances in patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). the subcommittee members initially agreed on the concepts of disease activity, damage and severity, defining severity as the total effect of disease on organ function. it was decided to start with the assessment of severity using the medsger's severity scale. a revised version of this scale was constructed. the rationale for the exclusion of other variables was provided.
hormonal regulation of beta-catenin during development of the avian oviduct and its expression in epithelial cell-derived ovarian carcinogenesis introductionbreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease encompassing a number of phenotypically diverse tumours. expression levels of the oestrogen, progesterone and her2/neu receptors which characterize clinically distinct breast tumours have been shown to change during disease progression and in response to systemic therapies. mi(cro)rnas play critical roles in diverse biological processes and are aberrantly expressed in several human neoplasms including breast cancer, where they function as regulators of tumour behaviour and progression. the aims of this study were to identify mirna signatures that accurately predict the oestrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr) and her2/neu receptor status of breast cancer patients to provide insight into the regulation of breast cancer phenotypes and progression.methodsexpression profiling of 453 mirnas was performed in 29 early-stage breast cancer specimens. mirna signatures associated with er, pr and her2/neu status were generated using artificial neural networks (ann), and expression of specific mirnas was validated using rq-pcr.resultsstepwise ann analysis identified predictive mirna signatures corresponding with oestrogen (mir-342, mir-299, mir-217, mir-190, mir-135b, mir-218), progesterone (mir-520g, mir-377, mir-527-518a, mir-520f-520c) and her2/neu (mir-520d, mir-181c, mir-302c, mir-376b, mir-30e) receptor status. mir-342 and mir-520g expression was further analysed in 95 breast tumours. mir-342 expression was highest in er and her2/neu-positive luminal b tumours and lowest in triple-negative tumours. mir-520g expression was elevated in er and pr-negative tumours.conclusionsthis study demonstrates that ann analysis reliably identifies biologically relevant mirnas associated with specific breast cancer phenotypes. the association of specific mirnas with er, pr and her2/neu status indicates a role for these mirnas in disease classification of breast cancer. decreased expression of mir-342 in the therapeutically challenging triple-negative breast tumours, increased mir-342 expression in the luminal b tumours, and downregulated mir-520g in er and pr-positive tumours indicates that not only is dysregulated mirna expression a marker for poorer prognosis breast cancer, but that it could also present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
identifying pleiotropic genes in genome-wide association studies from related subjects using the linear mixed model and fisher combination function for most human complex diseases and traits, snps identified by genome-wide association studies (gwas) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (gcta), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. gcta estimates the variance explained by all the snps on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular snp to the trait. we introduce gcta's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from snps, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the snps, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and gwas simulation. we focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the snps on the x chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. the gcta software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large gwas data sets.
modeling the response of a population of olfactory receptor neurons to an odorant olfactory receptors code the concentration of stimulating molecules into an impulse frequency message. patch-clamp recordings have now demonstrated, in the olfactory receptor cell membrane, a number of membrane conductances. some of them are gated by odorants, in the cilia, and depolarize the cell through camp- or ip3-sensitive channels, depending on the species. other conductances are activated by membrane depolarization and/or an increased intracellular ca2+ concentration; they participate in oscillating membrane potential changes during impulses and post-spike after-polarizations, and control the repetitive firing. original data relative to the resting potential and the impulse frequency coding of the odorant concentration are presented.
interactions between imidazoline i2 receptor ligands and acetaminophen in adult male rats: antinociception and schedule-controlled responding &na; a method to measure cutaneous hyperalgesia to thermal stimulation in unrestrained animals is described. the testing paradigm uses an automated detection of the behavioral end‐point; repeated testing does not contribute to the development of the observed hyperalgesia. carrageenan‐induced inflammation resulted in significantly shorter paw withdrawal latencies as compared to saline‐treated paws and these latency changes corresponded to a decreased thermal nociceptive threshold. both the thermal method and the randall‐selitto mechanical method detected dose‐related hyperalgesia and its blockade by either morphine or indomethacin. however, the thermal method showed greater bioassay sensitivity and allowed for the measurement of other behavioral parameters in addition to the nociceptive threshold.
hypercapnia improves tissue oxygenation the partial rebreathing method of cardiac output estimation is reviewed with a particular focus on its application for continuous monitoring, rebreathing and implementations and from both a historical and technical perspective. the assumptions of the method are discussed as well as the various implementations. the nico monitor and rebreathing valve are described from a functional view. the clinical data including (a) comparisons between bolus thermodilution and continuous thermodilution in patients in the or setting, (b) comparisons to continuous thermodilution with both the baxter and abbott continuous cardiac output devices and (c) comparison between different means of shunt correction are presented. compared to conventional cardiac output methods, the partial co2 rebreathing technique is non-invasive, can easily be automated and can provide real-time and continuous cardiac output monitoring. taking advantage of modern sophisticated sensor and signal processing technology and integrating multiple monitored physiological variables the nico monitor is the first commercially available cardiac output system making use of the partial rebreathing of co2.
stochastic extended lqr for optimization-based motion planning under uncertainty we present extended lqr, a novel approach for locally-optimal control for robots with non-linear dynamics and non-quadratic cost functions. our formulation is conceptually different from existing approaches, and is based on the novel concept of lqr-smoothing, which is an lqr-analogue of kalman smoothing. our approach iteratively performs both a backward extended lqr pass, which computes approximate cost-to-go functions, and a forward extended lqr pass, which computes approximate cost-to-come functions. the states at which the sum of these functions is minimal provide an approximately optimal sequence of states for the control problem, and we use these points to linearize the dynamics and quadratize the cost functions in the subsequent iteration. our results indicate that extended lqr converges quickly and reliably to a locally-optimal solution of the non-linear, non-quadratic optimal control problem. in addition, we show that our approach is easily extended to include temporal optimization, in which the duration of a trajectory is optimized as part of the control problem. we demonstrate the potential of our approach on two illustrative non-linear control problems involving simulated and physical differential-drive robots and simulated quadrotor helicopters.
d c ] 1 2 fe b 20 13 hfsp : the hadoop fair sojourn protocol as organizations start to use data-intensive cluster computing systems like hadoop and dryad for more applications, there is a growing need to share clusters between users. however, there is a conflict between fairness in scheduling and data locality (placing tasks on nodes that contain their input data). we illustrate this problem through our experience designing a fair scheduler for a 600-node hadoop cluster at facebook. to address the conflict between locality and fairness, we propose a simple algorithm called delay scheduling: when the job that should be scheduled next according to fairness cannot launch a local task, it waits for a small amount of time, letting other jobs launch tasks instead. we find that delay scheduling achieves nearly optimal data locality in a variety of workloads and can increase throughput by up to 2x while preserving fairness. in addition, the simplicity of delay scheduling makes it applicable under a wide variety of scheduling policies beyond fair sharing.
guideline-concordant antimicrobial therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis objective because of the pressure for timely, informed decisions in public health and clinical practice and the explosion of information in the scientific literature, research results must be synthesized. meta-analyses are increasingly used to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. a workshop was held in atlanta, ga, in april 1997, to examine the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid authors, reviewers, editors, and readers.   participants twenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and biomedical editing. deliberations of the workshop were open to other interested scientists. funding for this activity was provided by the centers for disease control and prevention.   evidence we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using medline, educational research information center (eric), psyclit, and the current index to statistics. we also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved and contacted experts in the field. participants were assigned to small-group discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods.   consensus process from the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational studies. the checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference attendees and additional experts. all suggestions for revisions were addressed.   conclusions the proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. use of the checklist should improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers, and decision makers. an evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are explored.
anthropometric index for pectus excavatum. this paper contains an analysis of the long-term results in 85 patients who had pectus excavatum or carinatum deformities repaired at the north middlesex hospital between 1951 and 1977. seventy-seven patients had operations for correction of pectus excavatum and eight for pectus carinatum. a variety of surgical techniques was used. in the excavatum deformities the best results were obtained by the extensive resection of all deformed cartilages, the correction of the sternal deformity by a simple transverse wedge osteotomy, and by stabilising the chest with a stainless steel plate. for pectus carinatum, the involved cartilages were resected and an osteotomy of the sternum was performed. we preferred in most cases to stabilise the chest wall with a metal strut in this deformity as well. the best cosmetic results were achieved by the use of a stainless steel plate passed beneath the sternum and left for not more than six months.
signal transduction of aortic and carotid sinus baroreceptors is not modified by central command during spontaneous motor activity in decerebrate cats. animals decerebrated at the precollicular-premammillary body level exhibit spontaneous locomotion without any artificial stimulation. our laboratory reported that the cardiovascular and autonomic responses at the onset of spontaneous locomotor events are evoked by central command, generated from the caudal diencephalon and the brain stem (matsukawa k, murata j, and wada t. am j physiol heart circ physiol 275: h1115-h1121, 1998). in this study, we examined whether central command and/or a reflex resulting from muscle afferents modulates arterial baroreflex function using a decerebrate cat model. the baroreflex was evoked by stimulating the aortic depressor nerve (adn) at the onset of spontaneous muscle contraction (to test the possible influence of central command) and during electrically evoked contraction or passive stretch (to test the possible influence of the muscle reflex). when the adn was stimulated at rest, heart rate and arterial blood pressure decreased by 40 +/- 2 beats/min and 11 +/- 1 mmhg, respectively. the baroreflex bradycardia was attenuated to 55 +/- 4% at the onset of spontaneous contraction. the attenuating effect on the baroreflex bradycardia was not observed at the onset and middle of electrically evoked contraction or passive stretch. the depressor response to adn stimulation was identical among resting and any muscle interventions. the inhibition of the baroreflex bradycardia during spontaneous contraction was seen after beta-adrenergic blockade but abolished by muscarinic blockade, suggesting that the bradycardia is mainly evoked through cardiac vagal outflow. we conclude that central command, produced within the caudal diencephalon and the brain stem, selectively inhibits the cardiac component, but not the vasomotor component, of the aortic baroreflex at the onset of spontaneous exercise.

short interval between two pap smears: effect on the result of the second smear? a prospective randomized trial meta-analysis involves combining summary information from related but independent studies. the objectives of a meta-analysis include increasing power to detect an overall treatment effect, estimation of the degree of benefit associated with a particular study treatment, assessment of the amount of variability between studies, or identification of study characteristics associated with particularly effective treatments. this article presents a tutorial on meta-analysis intended for anyone with a mathematical statistics background. search strategies and review methods of the literature are discussed. emphasis is focused on analytic methods for estimation of the parameters of interest. three modes of inference are discussed: maximum likelihood; restricted maximum likelihood, and bayesian. finally, software for performing inference using restricted maximum likelihood and fully bayesian methods are demonstrated. methods are illustrated using two examples: an evaluation of mortality from prophylactic use of lidocaine after a heart attack, and a comparison of length of hospital stay for stroke patients under two different management protocols.
an enhanced entity-attribute-value data model for representing high dimensional and sparse healthcare data abstract objective to determine the effects of a policy of “use acupuncture” on headache, health status, days off sick, and use of resources in patients with chronic headache compared with a policy of “avoid acupuncture.” design randomised, controlled trial. setting general practices in england and wales. participants 401 patients with chronic headache, predominantly migraine. interventions patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 12 acupuncture treatments over three months or to a control intervention offering usual care. main outcome measures headache score, sf-36 health status, and use of medication were assessed at baseline, three, and 12 months. use of resources was assessed every three months. results headache score at 12 months, the primary end point, was lower in the acupuncture group (16.2, sd 13.7, n = 161, 34% reduction from baseline) than in controls (22.3, sd 17.0, n = 140, 16% reduction from baseline). the adjusted difference between means is 4.6 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 7.0; p = 0.0002). this result is robust to sensitivity analysis incorporating imputation for missing data. patients in the acupuncture group experienced the equivalent of 22 fewer days of headache per year (8 to 38). sf-36 data favoured acupuncture, although differences reached significance only for physical role functioning, energy, and change in health. compared with controls, patients randomised to acupuncture used 15% less medication (p = 0.02), made 25% fewer visits to general practitioners (p = 0.10), and took 15% fewer days off sick (p = 0.2). conclusions acupuncture leads to persisting, clinically relevant benefits for primary care patients with chronic headache, particularly migraine. expansion of nhs acupuncture services should be considered.
negative effect of chronic cadmium exposure on growth, histology, ultrastructure, antioxidant and innate immune responses in the liver of zebrafish: preventive role of blue light emitting diodes. cadmium (cd) is an environmental contaminant that poses serious risks to aquatic organisms and their associated ecosystem. the mechanisms underlying cd-induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in fish remain largely unknown. in this study, adult female zebrafish were exposed to 0 (control), 1mgl-1 cd for 24h and 96h, and the oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by cd were evaluated in the brain, liver and ovary. reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no), and malondialdehyde (mda) increased in a time-dependent manner after treatment with cd in the brain and liver. the increase may result from the disturbance of genes including copper and zinc superoxide dismutase (cu/zn-sod), catalase (cat), inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), and ciclooxigenase-2 (cox-2) at mrna, protein and activity levels. although ros, no and mda were not significantly affected by cd in the ovary, the up-regulation of cu/zn-sod, cat, inos, and cox-2 was observed. exposure to cd induced a sharp increase in the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) in the brain, liver and ovary, possibly contributing to activate inflammatory responses. furthermore, we also found a dramatic increase in mrna levels of nf-e2-related factor 2 (nrf2) and nuclear transcription factor κb (nf-κb) at 24h in the liver and ovary. the corresponding changes in the mrna levels of kelch-like-ech-associated protein 1 (keap1a and keap1b) and the inhibitor of κbα (iκbαa and iκbαb) may contribute to regulate the transcriptional activity of nrf2 and nf-κb, respectively. contrarily, mrna levels of nrf2, nf-κb, keap1, keap1b, iκbαa and iκbαb remained stable at 24 and 96h in the brain. taken together, we demonstrated cd-induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in fish, possibly through transcriptional regulation of nrf2 and nf-κb and gene modifications at transcriptional, translational, post-translational levels, which would greatly extend our understanding on the cd toxicity.
ets-2 repressor factor recruits histone deacetylase to silence human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene expression in non-permissive cells. the 86k immediate early (ie) 2 protein of human cytomegalovirus trans-activates a number of homologous and heterologous promoters, including the cellular promoter for the 70k heat-shock protein (hsp70), and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat. we have previously shown that ie2 trans-activates these two promoters in a tata-dependent manner, and that ie2 is able to form a direct contact with tata-box binding protein (tbp) in vitro. we now show that ie2 binds to the basic repeat region of tbp. in addition ie2 can contact a second general transcription factor, tfiib. we have mapped the tbp- and tfiib-binding regions within ie2 and show that these regions overlap, and also lie within parts of the protein previously identified as being required for the trans-activation and autoregulation functions of ie2.
life-long endurance running is associated with reduced glycation and mechanical stress in connective tissue the present study examined the hypothesis that collagen fibril diameter and crimp angle in ruptured human achilles tendons differed from that of intact ones. tissue samples were obtained from the central core (distal core) and the posterior periphery (distal superficial) at the rupture site, and the proximally intact (proximal superficial) part of the tendon in 10 subjects (38+/-8 years) with a complete tendon rupture. for comparisons corresponding tissue samples were procured from age (38+/-7 years) and gender matched intact achilles tendons during routine forensic autopsy. the cross-sectional area density and diameter distribution of fibrils were analyzed using stereological techniques of digitized electron microscopy biopsy cross-sections, while crimp angle was measured by the changing banding pattern of collagen fibers when rotated between crossed polars. nine of 10 persons with tendon ruptures reported that the injury did not occur during exceedingly large forces, and none experienced any symptoms in the days or months prior to the injury. fibril diameter distribution showed no region-specific differences in either the ruptured or intact tendons for either group. however, in the distal core there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured compared to the intact tendons in 60-150 nm range, p<0.01. similarly, in the distal superficial portion there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured compared to the intact tendons in the 90-120 nm range, 2p<0.05, while there were no differences in the proximal superficial tendons. crimp angle did not display any region-specific differences, or any difference between the rupture and intact tendons. in conclusion, these data suggest that although crimp morphology is unchanged there appears to be a site-specific loss of larger fibrils in the core and periphery of the achilles tendon rupture site. moreover, the lack of symptoms prior to the rupture suggests that clinical tendinopathy is not an etiological factor in complete tendon ruptures.
on the cost of database clusters reconfiguration many cluster based replication solutions have been proposed providing scalability and fault-tolerance. many of these solutions perform replica control in a middleware on top of the database replicas. in such a setting concurrency control is a challenge and is often performed on a table basis. additionally, some systems put severe requirements on transaction programs (e.g., to declare all objects to be accessed in advance). this paper addresses these issues and presents a middleware-based replication scheme which provides the popular snapshot isolation level at the same tuple-level granularity as database systems like postgresql and oracle, without any need to declare transaction properties in advance. both read-only and update transactions can be executed at any replica while providing data consistency at all times. our approach provides what we call "1-copy-snapshot-isolation" as long as the underlying database replicas provide snapshot isolation. we have implemented our approach as a replicated middleware on top of postgresql replicas. by providing a standard jdbc interface, the middleware is completely transparent to the client program. fault-tolerance is provided by automatically reconnecting clients in case of crashes. our middleware shows good performance in terms of response times and scalability.
manual therapy treatment of cervicogenic dizziness: a systematic review. background although low back pain is usually a self-limiting and benign disease that tends to improve spontaneously over time, a large variety of therapeutic interventions are available for the treatment of low back pain.   objectives the objective of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of non-specific low back pain.   search strategy we searched the cochrane complementary medicine field trials register, the cochrane controlled trials register (1997, issue 1), medline (1966 - 1996), embase (1988 - 1996), science citation index and reference lists of articles.   selection criteria randomised trials of all types of acupuncture treatment that involves needling for subjects with non-specific low back pain.   data collection and analysis two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.   main results eleven trials were included. the methodological quality was low. only two trials were of high quality. three trials compared acupuncture to no treatment, which were of low methodological quality and provide conflicting evidence. there was moderate evidence from two trials that acupuncture is not more effective than trigger point injection or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens). there was limited evidence from eight trials that acupuncture is not more effective than placebo or sham acupuncture for the treatment of chronic low back pain.   reviewer's conclusions the evidence summarised in this systematic review does not indicate that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of back pain.
theoretical consideration of the effect of drug holidays on bmd and tissue age context the optimal duration of treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis is uncertain.   objective to compare the effects of discontinuing alendronate treatment after 5 years vs continuing for 10 years.   design and setting randomized, double-blind trial conducted at 10 us clinical centers that participated in the fracture intervention trial (fit).   participants one thousand ninety-nine postmenopausal women who had been randomized to alendronate in fit, with a mean of 5 years of prior alendronate treatment.   intervention randomization to alendronate, 5 mg/d (n = 329) or 10 mg/d (n = 333), or placebo (n = 437) for 5 years (1998-2003).   main outcome measures the primary outcome measure was total hip bone mineral density (bmd); secondary measures were bmd at other sites and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. an exploratory outcome measure was fracture incidence.   results compared with continuing alendronate, switching to placebo for 5 years resulted in declines in bmd at the total hip (-2.4%; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.9% to -1.8%; p<.001) and spine (-3.7%; 95% ci, -4.5% to -3.0%; p<.001), but mean levels remained at or above pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. similarly, those discontinuing alendronate had increased serum markers of bone turnover compared with continuing alendronate: 55.6% (p<.001) for c-telopeptide of type 1 collagen, 59.5% (p < .001) for serum n = propeptide of type 1 collagen, and 28.1% (p<.001) for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, but after 5 years without therapy, bone marker levels remained somewhat below pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. after 5 years, the cumulative risk of nonvertebral fractures (rr, 1.00; 95% ci, 0.76-1.32) was not significantly different between those continuing (19%) and discontinuing (18.9%) alendronate. among those who continued, there was a significantly lower risk of clinically recognized vertebral fractures (5.3% for placebo and 2.4% for alendronate; rr, 0.45; 95% ci, 0.24-0.85) but no significant reduction in morphometric vertebral fractures (11.3% for placebo and 9.8% for alendronate; rr, 0.86; 95% ci, 0.60-1.22). a small sample of 18 transilial bone biopsies did not show any qualitative abnormalities, with bone turnover (double labeling) seen in all specimens.   conclusions women who discontinued alendronate after 5 years showed a moderate decline in bmd and a gradual rise in biochemical markers but no higher fracture risk other than for clinical vertebral fractures compared with those who continued alendronate. these results suggest that for many women, discontinuation of alendronate for up to 5 years does not appear to significantly increase fracture risk. however, women at very high risk of clinical vertebral fractures may benefit by continuing beyond 5 years.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct 00398931.
view-based consistency and its implementation shared memory facilitates the transition from sequential to parallel processing. since most data structures can be retained, simply adding synchronization achieves correct, efficient programs for many applications. we discuss our experience with parallel computing on networks of workstations using the treadmarks distributed shared memory system. dsm allows processes to assume a globally shared virtual memory even though they execute on nodes that do not physically share memory. we illustrate a dsm system consisting of n networked workstations, each with its own memory. the dsm software provides the abstraction of a globally shared memory, in which each processor can access any data item without the programmer having to worry about where the data is or how to obtain its value.
chronic administration of cholesterol oximes in mice increases transcription of cytoprotective genes and improves transcriptome alterations induced by alpha-synuclein overexpression in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons microarray-based assays have significantly expanded their scope and range of applications over the last 10 years, and--at least for gene expression--can be considered mainstream applications. high-throughput, microarray-based gene expression studies have proven particularly useful in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, for which they have provided key insights in understanding disease pathogenesis, regional and cellular specificity, and identification of therapeutic targets. even though many experimental steps are currently performed in specialized core facilities, the key steps of a microarray study--experimental design, and data analysis and interpretation--are performed by the primary investigator. knowledge of the issues related to these key steps is essential to properly perform and interpret a microarray experiment and constitutes the main focus of the present chapter. the basic analytical steps are covered, and annotated r code for the analysis of a published dataset is provided.
exploring the role of drug-metabolising enzymes in antidepressant side effects the construction of a depression rating scale designed to be particularly sensitive to treatment effects is described. ratings of 54 english and 52 swedish patients on a 65 item comprehensive psychopathology scale were used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness in the combined sample. ratings on these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting of the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and the highest correlation to overall change. the inner-rater reliability of the new depression scale was high. scores on the scale correlated significantly with scores on a standard rating scale for depression, the hamilton rating scale (hrs), indicating its validity as a general severity estimate. its capacity to differentiate between responders and non-responders to antidepressant treatment was better than the hrs, indicating greater sensitivity to change. the practical and ethical implications in terms of smaller sample sizes in clinical trials are discussed.
impact of opiate addiction on neuroinflammation in hiv the national neuroaids tissue consortium (nntc) was founded in 1998, in response to the scientific need for well‐characterized central nervous system (cns) and peripheral nervous system (pns) tissues and fluids from hiv‐infected individuals. in addition to performing the routine functions of non‐transplant anatomic tissue banks, the consortium offers a unique model for the integration of independent research entities in order to provide well‐characterized tissues and fluids for the international research community. herein, we describe the structure of the consortium, pointing out the inherent strengths of linking together multiple independent sites for the purpose of banking hiv‐infected nervous system tissues. we describe the neuropathology protocol that was adopted and successfully implemented at the four participating banks of the consortium.
interaction of ethanol with inducible nitric oxide synthase messenger rna and protein: direct effects on autacoids and endotoxin in vivo. research over the past 5 years has demonstrated that immunologic activation of mouse macrophages induces the activity of nitric oxide synthase, which oxidizes a guanidino nitrogen of l-arginine, yielding citrulline and the reactive radical, nitric oxide. a review of the biochemistry and immunologic regulation of this pathway in macrophages provides a backdrop against which to evaluate its effector functions. reports published in the past 2 years suggest that synthesis of no mediates much of the antimicrobial activity of mouse macrophages against some fungal, helminthic, protozoal and bacterial pathogens.
in silico construction of a protein interaction landscape for nucleotide excision repair the blast programs are widely used tools for searching protein and dna databases for sequence similarities. for protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the blast programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. a new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped blast program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. in addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by blast into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. the resulting position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped blast, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. psi-blast is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the brct superfamily.
association between fcgammar iia and iiia polymorphism and clinical manifestations in korean patients with adult-onset still's disease. stimulation of primary human monocytes from several donors by cross‐linking of fcγ receptor type i (fcγri) and fcγrii gave rise to calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. these early events were not observed without cross‐linking. cd45, a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, when co‐cross‐linked with either fcγri or fcγrii, could prevent fcγri and fcγrii‐mediated calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. when interleukin (il)‐6 production was measured, we noted a strong il‐6 production after activation of primary human monocytes by cross‐linking of fcγri or fcγrii. in contrast to calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, il‐6 production was not affected by co‐cross‐linking of cd45 with either fcγri or fcγrii. interestingly, cross‐linking of the cd45 itself was sufficient to induce il‐6 production. our results show that the cd45 molecule is important in modulating early events following stimulation of primary human monocytes by cross‐linking of fcγri or fcγrii. however, triggering of cd45 alone can also induce il‐6 production, indicating that cd45 ligation itself can give signals and may have an important role in cytokine induction pathways.
unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks to guide marker discovery in recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (cnns) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. comparatively, unsupervised learning with cnns has received less attention. in this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of cnns for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. we introduce a class of cnns called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (dcgans), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.
variability of quantal synaptic currents in thalamocortical neurons. techniques of in vitro whole-cell recording and compartmental modeling were combined to investigate dendritic structure and calcium currents in individual thalamocortical neurons. voltage-clamp recordings of i t obtained in intact and dissociated ventrobasal neurons were used to constrain i t conductances and passive parameters incorporated in morphorealistic models. high dendritic i t densities were found necessary to establish congruent model behavior. several methodologies based on axial resistance conservation were developed to algorithmically reduce thalamocortical morphology into a behaviorally congruent low-order compartmental model. this type of simplified model is suitable for investigating the functional role played by distal t- current localization at the network level in sleep oscillations and epilepsy.
viability of booby offspring is maximized by having one young parent and one old parent summary this paper describes and discusses graphical techniques, based on the primitive empirical cumulative distribution function and on quantile (q-q) plots, percent (p-p) plots and hybrids of these, which are useful in assessing a one-dimensional sample, either from original data or resulting from analysis. areas of application include: the comparison of samples; the comparison of distributions; the presentation of results on sensitivities of statistical methods; the analysis of collections of contrasts and of collections of sample variances; the assessment of multivariate contrasts;_ and the structuring of analysis of variance mean squares. many of the objectives and techniques are illustrated by examples. this paper reviews a variety of old and new statistical techniques based on the cumulative distribution function and its ramifications. included in the coverage are applications, for various situations and purposes, of quantile probability plots (q-q plots), percentage probability plots (p-p plots) and extensions and hybrids of these. the general viewpoint is that of analysis of data by statistical methods that are suggestive and constructive rather than formal procedures to be applied in the light of a tightly specified mathematical model. the technological background is taken to be current capacities in data collection and highspeed computing systems, including graphical display facilities. it is very often useful in statistical data analysis to examine and to present a body of data as though it may have originated as a one-dimensional sample, i.e. data which one wishes to treat for purposes of analysis, as an unstructured array. sometimes this is applicable to ' original' data; even more often such a viewpoint is useful with 'derived' data, e.g. residuals from a model fitted to the data. the empirical cumulative distribution function and probability plotting methods have a key role in the statistical treatment of one-dimensional samples, being of relevance for summarization and palatable description as well as for exposure and inference.
incremental fine-grained information status classification using attention-based lstms recognizing bridging anaphora is difficult due to the wide variation within the phenomenon, the resulting lack of easily identifiable surface markers and their relative rarity. we develop linguistically motivated discourse structure, lexico-semantic and genericity detection features and integrate these into a cascaded minority preference algorithm that models bridging recognition as a subtask of learning finegrained information status (is). we substantially improve bridging recognition without impairing performance on other is classes.
empathy or ownership? evidence from corticospinal excitability modulation during pain observation when we look at our hands, we immediately know that they are part of our own body. this feeling of ownership of our limbs is a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness. we have studied the neuronal counterparts of this experience. a perceptual illusion was used to manipulate feelings of ownership of a rubber hand presented in front of healthy subjects while brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. the neural activity in the premotor cortex reflected the feeling of ownership of the hand. this suggests that multisensory integration in the premotor cortex provides a mechanism for bodily self-attribution.
anti-eye muscle igg and igm antibodies are associated with eye muscle type 2 deiodinase activities in hyperthyroid graves’ ophthalmopathy circulating igg and iga anti-thyroid and anti-eye muscle antibodies were investigated in 87 patients with graves' disease (60 cases with ophthalmopathy). the elisa method was used. both igg and iga antibodies were demonstrated against human thyroid and eye-muscle membrane or cytosol antigens. anti-eye-muscle antibodies of the iga type were observed more frequently than those of the igg type (25 cases vs. 18 were demonstrated with membrane antigens and 37 cases vs. 23 with cytosol antigens). the respective distributions for thyroid antigens the cytosol fraction were 55 cases vs. 13 and 18 cases vs. 36. a significant difference was observed in the anti-thyroid igg levels and the anti-eye-muscle membrane or cytosol levels between the patients with graves' disease and those in control group (p less than 0.001). the difference in the iga antibody to thyroid and eye-muscle antigens was significant between the patients with and without ophthalmopathy (p less than 0.002). the strong correlation between the levels of iga antibodies to thyroid and those to the eye-muscle cytosol fractions might be connected with the theory of the common aetiology of the thyroid and eye diseases in graves' ophthalmopathy (p less than 0.001). circulating iga anti-human thyroid and eye-muscle antibodies seemed to have a diagnostic relevance in the development of ophthalmopathy in graves' ophthalmopathy.

dynamic correlation between intrahost hiv-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression abstract to understand the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection and the development of aids, we studied the evolution of the c2-v5 region of the hiv-1 env gene and of t-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. they were monitored from the time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the cxcr4 receptor (x4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases (∼1% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. x4 variants emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. the late-phase transition was also associated with failure of t-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in cd3+ t cells) and decline of cd4+ t cells to ≤200 cells/μl. the strength of these temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral coreceptor specificity, and t-cell homeostasis and subset composition supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent pattern of viral evolution during the course of hiv-1 infection in moderate progressors. recognition of this pattern may help explain previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated hiv-1 infections.

draft genome sequences of armillaria fuscipes, ceratocystiopsis minuta, ceratocystis adiposa, endoconidiophora laricicola, e-polonica and penicillium freii daomc 242723 motivation: although many next-generation sequencing (ngs) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. we have developed trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. results: the value of ngs read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. availability and implementation: trimmomatic is licensed under gpl v3. it is cross-platform (java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic contact: usadel@bio1.rwth-aachen.de supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
simulating the cortical 3d visuomotor transformation of reach depth human saccades require a nonlinear, eye orientation-dependent reference frame transformation to transform visual codes to the motor commands for eye muscles. primate neurophysiology suggests that this transformation is performed between the superior colliculus and brain stem burst neurons, but provides little clues as to how this is done. to understand how the brain might accomplish this, we trained a 3-layer neural net to generate accurate commands for kinematically correct 3-d saccades. the inputs to the network were a 2-d, eye-centered, topographic map of gaussian visual receptive fields and an efference copy of eye position in 6-dimensional, push-pull "neural integrator" coordinates. the output was an eye orientation displacement command in similar coordinates appropriate to drive brain stem burst neurons. the network learned to generate accurate, kinematically correct saccades, including the eye orientation-dependent tilts in saccade motor error commands required to match saccade trajectories to their visual input. our analysis showed that the hidden units developed complex, eye-centered visual receptive fields, widely distributed fixed-vector motor commands, and "gain field"-like eye position sensitivities. the latter evoked subtle adjustments in the relative motor contributions of each hidden unit, thereby rotating the population motor vector into the correct correspondence with the visual target input for each eye orientation: a distributed population mechanism for the visuomotor reference frame transformation. these findings were robust; there was little variation across networks with between 9 and 49 hidden units. because essentially the same observations have been reported in the visuomotor transformations of the real oculomotor system, as well as other visuomotor systems (although interpreted elsewhere in terms of other models) we suggest that the mechanism for visuomotor reference frame transformations identified here is the same solution used in the real brain.
characterization of the renal phenotype in a mouse model of marfan syndrome in the past, there has been considerable concern that treatment with active vitamin d might accelerate progression independent of hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria. nevertheless, 1,25(oh)2d3 has known antiproliferative properties and has also been shown to inhibit renal growth. since glomerular growth is a permissive factor for the development of glomerulosclerosis, we reasoned that 1,25(oh)2d3 might even attenuate progression. to test this working hypothesis we performed two experiments of 8 and 16 weeks duration, respectively, to compare subtotally nephrectomized (snx) rats treated with ethanol and snx treated with 1,25(oh)2d3. control animals were sham operated and pair-fed with snx animals. 1,25(oh)2d3 (3 ng/100 g body wt/day) was administered by osmotic minipump. 1,25(oh)2d3 had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure and only a transient effect on weight gain. snx reduced the number of glomeruli (left kidney) from an average of 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(4) per kidney. mean glomerular volume was 3.87 +/- 0.71 x 10(6) microns 3 in sham operated animals and significantly (p < 0.05) higher (10.1 +/- 1.75 x 10(6) microns 3) in untreated animals 16 weeks after snx. glomerular volume was significantly (p < 0.05) less in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated snx [10.1 +/- 1.75 in ethanol vs. 7.04 +/- 1.78 in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated snx]. in parallel, there was significantly (p < 0.01) less glomerulosclerosis [glomerulosclerosis index 1.16 +/- 0.14 in the ethanol treated snx vs. 0.80 +/- 0.16 in snx treated with 1,25(oh)2d3] in the eight week experiment. albuminuria was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated than in ethanol treated snx (mean 0.785 mg/24 hr, range 0.43 to 1.80, vs. 3.75 mg/24 hr, 1.29 to 14.2). the morphological data were directionally analogous in a second 16 week experiment. only slight changes of the vascular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial index were seen in snx and were not affected by 1,25(oh)2d3 further. to prove that the effect of 1,25(oh)2d3 was independent of pth, parathyreoidectomized snx rats without or with 1,25(oh)2d3 treatment were examined seven days post-snx. pcna staining showed suppression of cell proliferation. furthermore, in situ hybridization for transforming growth factor-b (tgf-beta) showed less vascular and tubular expression in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated rats. we conclude that 1,25(oh)2d3 has antiproliferative actions during the compensatory growth of nephrons in response to subtotal nephrectomy. these effects are independent of pth. the data document that 1,25(oh)2d3 reduces renal cell proliferation and glomerular growth as well as glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria as indicators of progressive glomerular damage.
developing a clinical teaching quality questionnaire for use in a university osteopathic pre-registration teaching program previous research evaluating the performance of horn's parallel analysis (pa) factor retention method with ordinal variables has produced unexpected findings. specifically, pa with pearson correlations has performed as well as or better than pa with the more theoretically appropriate polychoric correlations. seeking to clarify these findings, the current study employed a more comprehensive simulation study that included the systematic manipulation of 7 factors related to the data (sample size, factor loading, number of variables per factor, number of factors, factor correlation, number of response categories, and skewness) as well as 3 factors related to the pa method (type of correlation matrix, extraction method, and eigenvalue percentile). the results from the simulation study show that pa with either pearson or polychoric correlations is particularly sensitive to the sample size, factor loadings, number of variables per factor, and factor correlations. however, whereas pa with polychorics is relatively robust to the skewness of the ordinal variables, pa with pearson correlations frequently retains difficulty factors and is generally inaccurate with large levels of skewness. in light of these findings, we recommend the use of pa with polychoric correlations for the dimensionality assessment of ordinal-level data.
changes in accommodative responses with multifocal contact lenses: a pilot study dynamics of accommodation (far-to-near focus) and disaccommodation (near-to-far focus) are described as a function of response amplitude. accommodative responses to step stimuli of various amplitudes presented in real space were measured in eight 20-30 year old subjects. responses were fitted with exponential functions to determine amplitude, time constant and peak velocity. despite the intersubject variability, the results show that time constants of accommodation and peak velocity of disaccommodation increase with amplitude in all subjects. the dynamics of accommodation and disaccommodation are dependent on amplitude, but have different properties in each case.
why is the ratio of reflectivity effective for chlorophyll estimation in the lake water? a new uv submersible spectroradiometer has been employed to determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient for irradiance in the clearest natural waters [k(w)(lambda)] with emphasis on the spectral region from 300 to 400 nm. k(w)(lambda) can be related to the inherent optical properties of pure water, in particular the total absorption coefficient a(w)(lambda) and the molecular scattering coefficient b(m)(lambda), by means of equations derived from radiative transfer theory. we present an analysis showing that limiting values of k(w)(lambda) can be estimated from a(w)(lambda) and vice versa. published a(w)(lambda) data, which show discrepancies much larger than their estimated accuracies, are briefly reviewed and then compared, via our analysis, with k(w)(lambda) data (our own new and previously published data as well as relevant data of others). this comparative analysis and new data allow a consistent and accurate set of optical properties for the clearest natural waters and for pure fresh water and saltwater to be estimated from 300 to 800 nm.
ultrasonographic classification of achilles tendon ruptures as a rationale for individual treatment selection objective minimally invasive suture of the torn achilles tendon without opening the rupture site, reduction in the risk of a sural nerve lesion, and optimization of stump apposition.   indications fresh achilles tendon rupture.   contraindications chronic achillodynia, local corticoid injections, immunosuppressive therapy, old achilles tendon ruptures, rerupture.   surgical technique suture of the achilles tendon with a special instrument via a skin incision proximal to the rupture, without opening the peritenon or the rupture site, whereby the suture in the area of the proximal achilles tendon is placed in the layer between the lower-leg fascia and the peritenon with the threads running in a paratendinous direction.   results from january 1, 2000 to december 31, 2003, 61 patients with 62 achilles tendon ruptures were sutured using the percutaneous technique with the dresden instrument. no sural nerve lesions and only two reruptures (3.2%) were observed. in one patient (1.6%) a superficial late infection occurred after 8 weeks, when the tendon was already healed. of 47 patients with a follow-up time of at least 1 year, 39 with 40 achilles tendon ruptures were followed up (83%). according to the criteria of trillat & mounier-kuhn, the result was very good in 62% and good in 30%. on the aofas score, an average of 96 points (78-100 points) was achieved. 78% of the patients assessed the result of the treatment as very good and 20% as good.
three-column osteotomy for correction of cervical and cervicothoracic deformities: alignment changes and early complications in a multicenter prospective series of 23 patients sagittal spinal misalignment (ssm) is an established cause of pain and disability. treating physicians must be familiar with the radiographic findings consistent with ssm. additionally, the restoration or maintenance of physiological sagittal spinal alignment after reconstructive spinal procedures is imperative to achieve good clinical outcomes. the c-7 plumb line (sagittal vertical axis) has traditionally been used to evaluate sagittal spinal alignment; however, recent data indicate that the measurement of spinopelvic parameters provides a more comprehensive assessment of sagittal spinal alignment. in this review the authors describe the proper analysis of spinopelvic alignment for surgical planning. online videos supplement the text to better illustrate the key concepts.
dual-robot ultrasound-guided needle placement: closing the planning-imaging-action loop in both photoacoustic (pa) and ultrasonic (us) imaging, overall image quality is influenced by the optical and acoustical properties of the medium. consequently, with the increased use of combined pa and us (paus) imaging in preclinical and clinical applications, the ability to provide phantoms that are capable of mimicking desired properties of soft tissues is critical. to this end, gelatin-based phantoms were constructed with various additives to provide realistic acoustic and optical properties. forty-micron, spherical silica particles were used to induce acoustic scattering, intralipid® 20% iv fat emulsion was employed to enhance optical scattering and ultrasonic attenuation, while india ink, direct red 81, and evans blue dyes were utilized to achieve optical absorption typical of soft tissues. the following parameters were then measured in each phantom formulation: speed of sound, acoustic attenuation (from 6 to 22 mhz), acoustic backscatter coefficient (from 6 to 22 mhz), optical absorption (from 400 nm to 1300 nm), and optical scattering (from 400 nm to 1300 nm). results from these measurements were then compared to similar measurements, which are offered by the literature, for various soft tissue types. based on these comparisons, it was shown that a reasonably accurate tissue-mimicking phantom could be constructed using a gelatin base with the aforementioned additives. thus, it is possible to construct a phantom that mimics specific tissue acoustical and/or optical properties for the purpose of paus imaging studies.
converting redox signaling to apoptotic activities by stress-responsive regulators hsf1 and nrf2 in fenretinide treated cancer cells background the lipid second messenger ceramide, which is generated by acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases or ceramide synthases, is a common intermediate of many apoptotic pathways. metabolism of ceramide involves several enzymes, including glucosylceramide synthase and gd3 synthase, and results in the formation of gangliosides (gm3, gd3, and gt3), which in turn promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) and apoptosis. fenretinide, a retinoic acid derivative, is thought to induce apoptosis via increases in ceramide levels, but the link between ceramide and subsequent apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells is unclear.   methods sh-sy5y and htla230 neuroblastoma cells were treated with fenretinide in the presence or absence of inhibitors of enzymes important in ceramide metabolism (fumonisin b1, inhibitor of ceramide synthase; desipramine, inhibitor of acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases; and pdmp, inhibitor of glucosylceramide). small interfering rnas were used to specifically block acidic sphingomyelinase or gd3 synthase activities. apoptosis, ros, and gd3 expression were measured by flow cytometry.   results in neuroblastoma cells, ros generation and apoptosis were associated with fenretinide-induced increased levels of ceramide, glucosylceramide synthase activity, gd3 synthase activity, and gd3. fenretinide also induced increased levels of gd2, a ganglioside derived from gd3. inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase but not of neutral sphingomyelinase or ceramide synthase, blocked fenretinide-induced increases in ceramide, ros, and apoptosis. exogenous gd3 induced ros and apoptosis in sh-sy5y cells but not in sh-sy5y cells treated with baicalein, a specific 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor. exogenous gd2 did not induce apoptosis.   conclusions a novel pathway of fenretinide-induced apoptosis is mediated by acidic sphingomyelinase, glucosylceramide synthase, and gd3 synthase, which may represent targets for future drug development. gd3 may be a key signaling intermediate leading to apoptosis via the activation of 12-lipoxygenase.

the modality shift experiment in adults and children with high functioning autism the autism diagnostic observation schedule—generic (ados-g) is a semistructured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. the observational schedule consists of four 30-minute modules, each designed to be administered to different individuals according to their level of expressive language. psychometric data are presented for 223 children and adults with autistic disorder (autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pddnos) or nonspectrum diagnoses. within each module, diagnostic groups were equivalent on expressive language level. results indicate substantial interrater and test—retest reliability for individual items, excellent interrater reliability within domains and excellent internal consistency. comparisons of means indicated consistent differentiation of autism and pddnos from nonspectrum individuals, with some, but less consistent, differentiation of autism from pddnos. a priori operationalization of dsm-iv/icd-10 criteria, factor analyses, and roc curves were used to generate diagnostic algorithms with thresholds set for autism and broader autism spectrum/pdd. algorithm sensitivities and specificities for autism and pddnos relative to nonspectrum disorders were excellent, with moderate differentiation of autism from pddnos.
gender classification based on support vector machine with automatic confidence in this work, we present a novel approach to face recognition which considers both shape and texture information to represent face images. the face area is first divided into small regions from which local binary pattern (lbp) histograms are extracted and concatenated into a single, spatially enhanced feature histogram efficiently representing the face image. the recognition is performed using a nearest neighbour classifier in the computed feature space with chi square as a dissimilarity measure. extensive experiments clearly show the superiority of the proposed scheme over all considered methods (pca, bayesian intra/extrapersonal classifier and elastic bunch graph matching) on feret tests which include testing the robustness of the method against different facial expressions, lighting and aging of the subjects. in addition to its efficiency, the simplicity of the proposed method allows for very fast feature extraction.
the comparative reliability and feasibility of the past-year canadian diet history questionnaire ii: comparison of the paper and web versions multiple-day food records or 24-hour recalls are currently used as "reference" instruments to calibrate food frequency questionnaires (ffqs) and to adjust findings from nutritional epidemiologic studies for measurement error. the common adjustment is based on the critical requirements that errors in the reference instrument be independent of those in the ffq and of true intake. when data on urinary nitrogen level, a valid reference biomarker for nitrogen intake, are used, evidence suggests that a dietary report reference instrument does not meet these requirements. in this paper, the authors introduce a new model that includes, for both the ffq and the dietary report reference instrument, group-specific biases related to true intake and correlated person-specific biases. data were obtained from a dietary assessment validation study carried out among 160 women at the dunn clinical nutrition center, cambridge, united kingdom, in 1988-1990. using the biomarker measurements and dietary report measurements from this study, the authors compare the new model with alternative measurement error models proposed in the literature and demonstrate that it provides the best fit to the data. the new model suggests that, for these data, measurement error in the ffq could lead to a 51% greater attenuation of true nutrient effect and the need for a 2.3 times larger study than would be estimated by the standard approach. the implications of the results for the ability of ffq-based epidemiologic studies to detect important diet-disease associations are discussed.
consequences of opioid receptor mutation on actions of univalent and bivalent kappa and delta ligands despite ample pharmacological evidence for the existence of multiple mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor subtypes, only three genes encoding mu-(mor), delta-(dor) and kappa-(kor) opioid receptor have been cloned. the kor gene encodes kappa(1)-sites, which specifically bind arylacetamide compounds, and the possible existence of kappa-opioid receptor subtypes derived from another kappa-opioid-receptor gene, yet to be characterized, remains a very contentious issue. kappa(2)-opioid receptors are described as binding sites typically labelled by the non-selective benzomorphan ligand [3h]bremazocine in the presence of mu-, delta- and kappa(1)-opioid receptor blocking ligands. to investigate the genetic origin of kappa(2)-opioid receptors, we have carried out homogenate binding experiments with [3h]bremazocine in brains of single mor-, dor-, kor- and double mor/dor-deficient mice. scatchard analysis showed that 68+/-12% of the binding sites arise from the mor gene, 27+/-1% from the dor gene and 14.5+/-0.2% from the kor gene, indicating that the three known genes account for total [3h]bremazocine binding. experiments in the presence of mu-, delta- and kappa(1)-opioid receptor suppressor ligands further showed that non-kappa(1)-opioid receptor labelling can be accounted for by binding to both the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. finally, [3h]bremazocine binding experiments performed on brain membranes from the triple mor/dor/kor-deficient mice revealed a complete absence of binding sites, confirming definitively that no additional gene is required to explain the total population of [3h]bremazocine binding sites. altogether the data show that the putative kappa(2)-opioid receptors are in fact a mixed population of kor, dor and predominantly mor gene products.
use of a β-hcg discriminatory zone with bedside pelvic ultrasonography. the most reliable ultrasonographic criteria for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy are based on the appearance of the uterus in the presence of a positive urine pregnancy test. the absence of an intrauterine sac signifies ectopic pregnancy, whereas its presence indicates intrauterine gestation. these criteria cannot be applied when serum pregnancy tests are used unless the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) level at which the sac of an intrauterine pregnancy becomes visible on ultrasound is known, because these tests are far more sensitive and identify pregnancy at an earlier stage than does sonar. in this study, the hcg level that distinguishes patients with intrauterine pregnancies in whom a gestational sac can be seen from those in whom it cannot be seen was determined and designated the discriminatory hcg zone. this zone lies between 6000 and 6500 mlu/ml. the absence of an intrauterine sac in conjunction with hcg values above this level signifies ectopic pregnancy; however, the absence of an intrauterine sac has no diagnostic significance when associated with hcg values below the discriminatory zone. an intrauterine sac associated with hcg levels above the discriminatory zone reliably indicates an intrauterine pregnancy, but at hcg values below the zone, it is suggestive of an abnormal pregnancy—either a missed abortion or an ectopic gestation.
hypothermia and postconditioning after cardiopulmonary resuscitation reduce cardiac dysfunction by modulating inflammation, apoptosis and remodeling volatile anesthetics exert cardioprotective properties in experimental and clinical studies. we designed this study to investigate the effects of sevoflurane on left ventricular (lv) performance during minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (midcab) without cardiopulmonary bypass. fifty-two patients scheduled for midcab surgery were randomly assigned to a propofol or a sevoflurane group. apart from the anesthetics used, there was no difference in surgical and anesthetic management. after determination of cardiac troponin t, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase mb, electrocardiographic (ecg) data and echocardiography variables (myocardial performance index and early to atrial filling velocity ratio) the left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) was clamped until anastomosis with the left internal mammary artery was completed. during lad occlusion and during reperfusion, echocardiography measurements were repeated. blood samples were obtained repeatedly for up to 72 h. after lad occlusion, myocardial performance index and early to atrial filling velocity ratio in the propofol group deteriorated significantly from 0.40 ± 0.12 and 1.29 ± 0.35 to 0.49 ± 0.10 and 1.13 ± 0.22, respectively, whereas there was no change in the sevoflurane group. in the propofol group myocardial performance index remained increased (0.47 ± 0.11) compared with baseline during reperfusion. there were no significant differences in ecg and laboratory values between groups. in conclusion, during a brief period of ischemia in patients undergoing midcab surgery, sevoflurane preserved myocardial function better than propofol.
characterization of the antimicrobial peptide family defensins in the tasmanian devil (sarcophilus harrisii), koala (phascolarctos cinereus), and tammar wallaby (macropus eugenii) backgroundthe thymus plays a critical role in the development and maturation of t-cells. humans have a single thoracic thymus and presence of a second thymus is considered an anomaly. however, many vertebrates have multiple thymuses. the tammar wallaby has two thymuses: a thoracic thymus (typically found in all mammals) and a dominant cervical thymus. researchers have known about the presence of the two wallaby thymuses since the 1800s, but no genome-wide research has been carried out into possible functional differences between the two thymic tissues. here, we used pyrosequencing to compare the transcriptomes of a cervical and thoracic thymus from a single 178 day old tammar wallaby.resultswe show that both the tammar thoracic and the cervical thymuses displayed gene expression profiles consistent with roles in t-cell development. both thymuses expressed genes that mediate distinct phases of t-cells differentiation, including the initial commitment of blood stem cells to the t-lineage, the generation of t-cell receptor diversity and development of thymic epithelial cells. crucial immune genes, such as chemokines were also present. comparable patterns of expression of non-coding rnas were seen. 67 genes differentially expressed between the two thymuses were detected, and the possible significance of these results are discussed.conclusionthis is the first study comparing the transcriptomes of two thymuses from a single individual. our finding supports that both thymuses are functionally equivalent and drive t-cell development. these results are an important first step in the understanding of the genetic processes that govern marsupial immunity, and also allow us to begin to trace the evolution of the mammalian immune system.
the plasma membrane of the cyanobacterium gloeobacter violaceus contains segregated bioenergetic domains[c][w] kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of the networks of genes and molecules. the major component of kegg is the pathway database that consists of graphical diagrams of biochemical pathways including most of the known metabolic pathways and some of the known regulatory pathways. the pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. kegg maintains the genes database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the ligand database for chemical compounds and enzymes. each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by java applet. in addition to the data collection efforts, kegg develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. the kegg databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).
the role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
validation of quantitative measures of rotatory knee laxity purposealthough various kinematic measurements with advanced technology have been used for quantitative evaluation of the pivot shift test, there is no clinically available quantification method of the pivot shift test. the purpose was to describe a novel image analysis technique for quantitative assessment of the pivot shift test using universally available and affordable devices.methodsfive acl deficient knees were tested during examination under anesthesia. three skin markers were attached to bony landmarks on the lateral side of the knee joint, (1) gerdy’s tubercle, (2) fibular head, and (3) lateral epicondyle. a standard digital video camera captured motion of the lateral aspect of the knee during the pivot shift test. the image was processed into a 2-dimensional (2-d) coordinate system with image j software (national institute of health, usa) to trace the three landmarks. the anteroposterior (ap) position of the femur was calculated on consecutive still images extracted from the video recording. ap translation over time was reported.resultsthe reduction phase of the pivot shift could be tracked consistently by a sudden anterior translation of the distal femur. the sudden anterior translation of the lateral epicondyle was on average 3.7 ± 2.1 mm and occurred within 0.2 ± 0.1 s from the start of this anterior translation till the end.conclusionthe sudden shift of the lateral compartment of the knee joint was successfully detected by this newly developed image analysis measurement method. this image analysis technique facilitates a simple and affordable method to evaluate the lateral pivot shift test.level of evidencediagnostic studies, level iv.
cross-lingual dependency transfer : what matters? assessing the impact of pre- and post-processing most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins. we present a transition-based system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with non-projective trees. experimental evaluation on chinese, czech, english and german shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-the-art results for all languages.
heavy metal ions are potent inhibitors of protein folding. the molecular chaperone proteins, particularly hsp60 and hsp70, have been implicated in essential cell functions under both normal and stress conditions (reviewed in refs 15). members of the family of heat-shock proteins ofm r70k, hsp70, bind to unfolded proteins and short peptides613. addition of mgatp results in the dissociation of the substrate polypeptides from the chaperone711, but as atp-γs (an atp analogue that is only slowly hydrolysable) cannot substitute for atp in this reaction7,9,11, it has been concluded that atp hydrolysis is necessary to dissociate hsp70substrate protein complexes. by independently measuring the rates of atp hydrolysis and substrate protein dissociation, we show here that mgatp binding but not mgatp hydrolysis is essential for substrate dissociation. we also show that there is an absolute requirement for k+for the effect of mgatp: only the combination of k+ and mgatp will cause the conformational change in hspto that is necessary for substrate dissociation. moreover, in the absence of k+, mgatp favours complex formation. we consider these results in terms of a g-protein-like model.
current concepts in the pathophysiology and management of arteriovenous access-induced hand ischemia. unlabelled the purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the vcs vascular clip approximating system for the creation of hemodialysis access fistulas. 173 new vascular accesses were created, 92 prosthetic grafts and 81 autologous fistulas over a 40-month period. 50 sutured and 42 clipped fistulas comprised the prosthetic graft series, and 33 sutured and 48 clipped cases the autologous series. risk factors associated with access patency were correlated and the primary patencies compared in the suture versus clipped group. a significant improvement in primary patency was noted for the clipped prosthetic group at all time points studied, with a positive trend also noted for clipped autologous fistulae.   conclusions the vascular clipping system (the vcs system) provides both long-term and immediate advantages for vascular access construction. clips have been used successfully to treat seven consecutive patients with upper extremity arterial steal syndrome without the technical difficulties associated with traditional methods of repair.
the regulatory effect of mirnas is a heritable genetic trait in humans backgroundover the last few years, genome-wide association (gwa) studies became a tool of choice for the identification of loci associated with complex traits. currently, imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) data are frequently used in gwa analyzes. correct analysis of imputed data calls for the implementation of specific methods which take genotype imputation uncertainty into account.resultswe developed the probabel software package for the analysis of genome-wide imputed snp data and quantitative, binary, and time-till-event outcomes under linear, logistic, and cox proportional hazards models, respectively. for quantitative traits, the package also implements a fast two-step mixed model-based score test for association in samples with differential relationships, facilitating analysis in family-based studies, studies performed in human genetically isolated populations and outbred animal populations.conclusionsprobabel package provides fast efficient way to analyze imputed data in genome-wide context and will facilitate future identification of complex trait loci.
mortality, severe acute respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness associated with influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 in argentina, 2009 we applied a reverse transcription (rt)-pcr assay for influenza a virus to combined nasal wash-throat swab specimens previously obtained from an outpatient pediatric population with acute respiratory illness during concurrent epidemics of influenza a virus and respiratory syncytial virus. the results of the rt-pcr assay were compared with those previously reported with virus cultivation and commercially available rapid diagnostic kits (e.a. dominguez, l.h. taber, and r.b. couch, j. clin. microbiol. 31:2286-2290, 1993). with virus cultivation as the "gold standard", the rt-pcr assay had a sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of 95, 98, and 97%, respectively, compared with 75, 100, and 93%, respectively, for the best diagnostic kit (becton dickinson directigen). rt-pcr is an effective alternative to virus isolation for the detection of influenza a virus in clinical specimens.
effect of performance level on pacing strategy during a 10-km running race abstractfield and laboratory studies were made on 16 trained distance runners to determine the relationship between selected metabolic measurements and distance running performance. measurements were made for oxygen consumption, heart rate, and blood lactate accumulation during submaximal and maxima
structure-function relationship and evolutionary history of the human selenoprotein m (selm) found over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. selenoproteins contain the trace element selenium incorporated as selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid. some members of the selenoprotein family, such as the glutathione peroxidases, have well-characterized antioxidant activity, functioning in enzymatic breakdown of hydroperoxides to protect cells against oxidative stress. however, the functions of many of the 25 human selenoproteins, including the brain-enriched selenoprotein m, are unknown. we investigated selenoprotein m function by manipulating expression in murine hippocampal ht22 cells, cerebellar astrocyte c8-d1a cells, and primary neuronal cultures. overexpression of the protein resulted in a reduction in reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death in response to oxidative challenge with hydrogen peroxide. in contrast, knock-down of selenoprotein m using shrna in primary neuronal cultures caused apoptotic cell death comparable to levels resulting from addition of hydrogen peroxide. calcium measurements with the indicator cameleon demonstrated that overexpression of selenoprotein m decreased calcium influx in response to hydrogen peroxide. additionally, knock-down of selenoprotein m expression in cortical cultures caused higher baseline levels of cytosolic calcium than in control cells. these results suggest that selenoprotein m may have an important role in protecting against oxidative damage in the brain and may potentially function in calcium regulation.
room for improvement in nutrition knowledge and dietary intake of male football (soccer) players in australia. nutrition knowledge is believed to influence nutritional intake, which in turn influences performance in elite athletes. there is currently no published data on the nutrition knowledge of elite australian football (af) players. the purpose of this study was to gain insight into the current level of general and sports nutrition knowledge in elite male af athletes. forty six elite male af players (23.5 ± 2.8 years) answered 123 questions relating to five areas of nutrition knowledge: dietary recommendations, sources of nutrients, choosing everyday foods, alcohol and sports nutrition. demographic details and perceptions of nutrition knowledge were collected for all participants. the mean nutrition knowledge score was 74.4 ± 10.9 (60.5%). the highest score was obtained in sports nutrition section (17.9 ± 3.0, 61.7%). the dietitian was selected as the first source of information by 98% of athletes, with club trainer and teammates as second choice for 45.7% and 23.9% of athletes, respectively. the majority of athletes correctly answered questions regarding recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable intake and decrease fat intake (95.6%, 91.1% and 93.3% correct respectively). while 80% of the athletes were aware fat intake should predominately be made up of unsaturated fat, they were less able to identify food sources of unsaturated fats (35.6% and 24.4% correct for statements regarding monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, respectively). broad nutrition messages and recommendations appear to be well understood; however, gaps in nutrition knowledge are evident. a better understanding of nutrition knowledge in athletes will allow nutrition education interventions to target areas in need of improvement.
differential pathway dependency discovery associated with drug response across cancer cell lines in this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). our structure, fibonacci heaps (abbreviated f-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by vuillemin and studied further by brown. f-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in 0(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in 0(1) amortized time. using f-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms.
dihydroxylated phenolic acids derived from microbial metabolism reduce lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine secretion by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to analyze adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and on different lymphocyte subpopulations (cd2+, cd8+, cd19+, and cd56+ subsets) in chronic alcoholism, 30 well-nourished chronic alcoholics without ethanol-related diseases and 30 matched controls were included in the study. adhesion molecules that mediate adhesion to other cells and to extracellular matrix proteins, and whose cellular expression is modified during lymphocyte activation, were selected for study. a detailed clinical evaluation, laboratory analysis, nutritional assessment, and study of adhesion molecule expression was performed. a significant higher expression of cd29 (beta1-integrin) (p = 0.001), vla-3 (p = 0.002), vla-4 (p = 0.03), and vla-5 (p = 0.001) were observed on pbmcs of chronic alcoholics, compared with control subjects, whereas no changes were observed in cd18 (beta2-integrin) and cd50 (icam-3) expression. the upregulation of cd29 and vla proteins only affected t lymphocytes (cd2+/cd8+/cd4+ cells). these data confirm that t cells of chronic alcoholics are basally activated and that changes in adhesion molecule expression on pbmcs may be responsible of disturbances of adhesion processes in chronic alcoholics without ethanol-related diseases.
a novel dag-dependent mechanism links pkca and cyclin b1 regulating cell cycle progression p21cip1/waf1 is the principle mediator of cell cycle arrest in response to dna damage. p21 primarily mediates g1 cell cycle arrest by inactivating g1-associated cyclin a- and cyclin e-containing cyclin/cdk complexes. in the present study we investigate the role of p21 in dna damage-induced g2 cell cycle arrest, particularly with respect to the g2-associated cyclin, cyclin b1. we demonstrate that cells lacking p21 or deficient in their ability to upregulate p21 are unable to mediate the downregulation of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage as compared to wild-type cells. decreased levels of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage seen in wild-type cells is due to p21-mediated degradation of cyclin b1 as this can be inhibited by a proteasomal inhibitor. cell cycle analysis reveals that p21-null cells are unable sustain g2 cell cycle arrest and accumulate at greater than 4n dna content. these results indicate that p21-mediated degradation of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage is necessary for the maintenance of g2 cell cycle arrest.
selection on body size and sexual size dimorphism differs between host species in a seed‐feeding beetle plants can vary substantially among species in morphological and physiological traits that influence their resistance to herbivores and their quality for herbivore growth and development. seeds of the desert trees cercidium floridum and c. microphyllum vary within and among populations in their resistance to, and suitability for, growth and development of larvae of the seed beetle, stator limbatus. we examined how this variation influences the magnitude of natural selection on the size of eggs laid by beetles and tested whether female beetles can distinguish between seeds of more vs. less suitable trees (within species). we found that selection favoring large eggs differed substantially between the two tree species (greater on c. floridum) and varied substantially among populations of c. floridum and among trees (within populations) of both c. floridum and c. microphyllum. in general, the magnitude of selection favoring large eggs correlated positively with seed coat resistance between tree species, among populations within species, and among trees within populations. female s. limbatus are capable of distinguishing seeds of the two host species and respond to species differences in selection by laying larger eggs on seeds of c. floridum than on seeds of c. microphyllum. however, despite large variation in seed suitability within populations of trees, females did not preferentially lay eggs on seeds of less resistant trees, nor did they adjust egg size in response to variation in resistance among trees.
fronto-basal interhemispheric approach for craniopharyngiomas extending outside the suprasellar cistern object craniopharyngiomas frequently grow from remnants of the rathke pouch, which is located on the cisternal surface of the hypothalamic region. these lesions can also extend elsewhere in the infundibulohypophyseal axis. the aim of this study was to establish the usefulness of the frontobasal approach made through a relatively small craniotomy window for the removal of tumors protruding from the sellar-suprasellar region into the third and basal cistern.   methods thirty-one patients who were surgically treated for craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar-suprasellar region were evaluated. the diagnoses were established in all cases by using magnetic resonance and computerized tomography imaging. the initial symptoms and signs were increased intracranial pressure in eight, vision impairment or visual field defect in 16, hypopituitarism in 17, and psychological disturbances in three cases. all patients underwent surgery via the frontobasal interhemispheric approach, and the average follow-up period was 30 months. total removal of the lesion was achieved in 22 cases, six patients underwent subtotal resection, and three underwent partial removal due to tumor recurrence after previous surgeries performed with or without adjunctive radiotherapy. major complications, including impairment of the cranial nerves, were not observed in the immediate postoperative period. one patient exhibited transient memory disturbance due to infarction of the perforating vessels; after 3 months this symptom was ameliorated. none of the patients died during long-term follow up; however, four of the 22 who underwent total removal and six of the nine patients who underwent subtotal or partial removal suffered recurrence. of the 10 patients with recurrence, six experienced a small recurrence of the lesion (average 3 months postsurgery); after gamma knife surgery (gks), the size of two of the lesions was unchanged and in four reoperation was performed due to tumor enlargement during the follow-up period. ultimately, a total of eight patients (four with recurrence and four who had been treated with gks) underwent reoperation, with gross-total removal via the same approach or combined with the orbitozygomatic approach in patients with very short optic nerves. in no patient was deterioration of visual acuity and visual field observed after surgery. although all patients except four children and one adult were receiving some form of hormone replacement therapy, their endocrine status was stably controllable.   conclusions in the authors' experience, the frontobasal interhemispheric approach, even made through a small craniotomy window, is a valid choice for the removal of craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar-suprasellar region. via this approach, tumors can be removed without significant sequelae related to the surgical method, due to ease of preservation of the pituitary stalk, hypothalamic structures, and perforating vessels. this approach offers a safe and minimally invasive means of treating craniopharyngiomas.
predictors of hearing-aid outcomes the aim of this study was to assess the relative importance of cochlear mechanical dysfunction, temporal processing deficits, and age on the ability of hearing-impaired listeners to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. sixty-eight listeners took part in the study. they were provided with linear, frequency-specific amplification to compensate for their audiometric losses, and intelligibility was assessed for speech-shaped noise (ssn) and a time-reversed two-talker masker (r2tm). behavioral estimates of cochlear gain loss and residual compression were available from a previous study and were used as indicators of cochlear mechanical dysfunction. temporal processing abilities were assessed using frequency modulation detection thresholds. age, audiometric thresholds, and the difference between audiometric threshold and cochlear gain loss were also included in the analyses. stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relative importance of the various factors for intelligibility. results showed that (a) cochlear gain loss was unrelated to intelligibility, (b) residual cochlear compression was related to intelligibility in ssn but not in a r2tm, (c) temporal processing was strongly related to intelligibility in a r2tm and much less so in ssn, and (d) age per se impaired intelligibility. in summary, all factors affected intelligibility, but their relative importance varied across maskers.
box-particle implementation and comparison of cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter in this work, a novel approach to nonlinear non-gaussian state estimation problems is presented based on mixtures of uniform distributions with box supports. this class of filtering methods, introduced in the light of interval analysis framework, is called box particle filter (bpf). it has been shown that weighted boxes, estimating the state variables, can be propagated using interval analysis tools combined with particle filtering ideas. in this paper, in the light of the widely used bayesian inference, we present a different interpretation of the bpf by expressing it as an approximation of posterior probability density functions, conditioned on available measurements, using mixture of uniform distributions. this interesting interpretation is theoretically justified. it provides derivation of the bpf procedures with detailed discussions.
psom+ : parametrized self-organizing maps for noisy and incomplete data we report on two new improvements for the “parameterised sel f-organizing map” (psom). both achieve a significant increase in mapping ac curacy and computational efficiency. for a growing number of training points the use of higher orde r polynomials to construct the psom “mapping manifold” in [7] can suffer fro m the increasing tendency to oscillate between the support points. we propos e here to confine the algorithm to a subset of the training knots, resulting in what we call the “local-psom” algorithm. this allows to avoid the use of highdegree polynomials without sacrificing accuracy. at the same time, the new approach offers a significant saving in required computations. a second way to improve the mapping preciseness makes use of t he superior approximation properties of chebyshev polynomials fo r the psom mapping manifold. the benefits of the two new approaches are demonstrated with t o benchmark problems:(i) approximating a gaussian bell function and (ii) learning of the (forward and inverse) kinematics of a 3 dof robot finger. i n both cases the psom algorithm exhibit an excellent generalisation ability and that already for a very small training set size of 3 3 3 points.
cisminer: genome-wide in-silico cis-regulatory module prediction by fuzzy itemset mining we are given a large database of customer transactions. each transaction consists of items purchased by a customer in a visit. we present an efficient algorithm that generates all significant association rules between items in the database. the algorithm incorporates buffer management and novel estimation and pruning techniques. we also present results of applying this algorithm to sales data obtained from a large retailing company, which shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.
a fully convolutional two-stream fusion network for interactive image segmentation interactive object selection is a very important research problem and has many applications. previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to estimate the foreground and background distributions. in this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based algorithm which has much better understanding of objectness and can reduce user interactions to just a few clicks. our algorithm transforms user-provided positive and negative clicks into two euclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the rgb channels of images to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. we generate many of such pairs by combining several random sampling strategies to model users' click patterns and use them to finetune deep fully convolutional networks (fcns). finally the output probability maps of our fcn-8s model is integrated with graph cut optimization to refine the boundary segments. our model is trained on the pascal segmentation dataset and evaluated on other datasets with different object classes. experimental results on both seen and unseen objects demonstrate that our algorithm has a good generalization ability and is superior to all existing interactive object selection approaches.
the role of co-administration of ascorbic acid and zinc gluconate on brain biochemical changes in wistar rats during the hot-humid season the mild yield characteristics of smallholder agropastoral fulani red sokoto goats were evaluated using records obtained from a total of 92 does in 6 herds, collected over a 2-year period. the results indicated that the total yield was 79.8±3.2 kg, the daily yield 0.66±0.03 kg, the peak yield 1.21±0.07 kg and the day of peak production 28.7±2.1 day of lactation. the milk yield characteristics were highly variable with a coefficient of variability of 38.6% to 69.8%. the characteristics were significantly (p<0.01–0.05) influenced by herd, season, parity and litter size of the dam. highly positive and significant (p<0.01) correlations (r = 0.66–0.99) existed between the total yield and the average daily yield, peak yield, initial yield and day 120 yield. a negative and significant (p<0.05) correlation (r = –0.33) was observed between the peak day and the initial yield. the non-homogeneity of the milk yield characteristics in red sokoto does suggests the possibility of improving their daily productivity by selection of high yielding does. selection for higher initial milk yield may also improve other milk yield characteristics.
a neural network for text representation we propose a new hierarchical generative model for textual data, where words may be generated by topic specific distributions at any level in the hierarchy. this model is naturally well-suited to clustering documents in preset or automatically generated hierarchies, as well as categorising new documents in an existing hierarchy. training algorithms are derived for both cases, and illustrated on real data by clustering news stories and categorising newsgroup messages. finally, the generative model may be used to derive a fisher kernel expressing similarity between documents.
spatial ability and other predictors of gameplay time : understanding barriers to learning in game-based virtual environments the emerging field of the learning sciences is one that is interdisciplinary, drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and research paradigms so as to build understandings of the nature and conditions of learning, cognition, and development. learning sciences researchers investigate cognition in context, at times emphasizing one more than the other but with the broad goal of developing evidence-based claims derived from both laboratory-based and naturalistic investigations that result in knowledge about how people learn. this work can involve the development of technological tools, curriculum, and especially theory that can be used to understand and support learning. a fundamental assumption of many learning scientists is that cognition is not a thing located within the individual thinker but is a process that is distributed across the knower, the environment in which knowing occurs, and the activity in which the learner participates. in other words, learning, cognition, knowing, and context are irreducibly co-constituted and cannot be treated as isolated entities or processes. if one believes that context matters in terms of learning and cognition, research paradigms that simply examine these processes as isolated variables within laboratory or other impoverished contexts of participation will necessarily lead to an incomplete understanding of their relevance in more naturalistic settings (brown, 1992).1 alternatively, simply observing learning and cognition as they naturally correspondence and requests for reprints should be sent to sasha a. barab, school of education,
adapting asynchronous messaging middleware to ad hoc networking recent advances in wireless networking technologies and the growing success of mobile computing devices, such as laptop computers, third generation mobile phones, personal digital assistants, watches and the like, are enabling new classes of applications that present challenging problems to designers. mobile devices face temporary loss of network connectivity when they move; they are likely to have scarce resources, such as low battery power, slow cpu speed and little memory; they are required to react to frequent and unannounced changes in the environment, such as high variability of network bandwidth, and in the remote resources availability, and so on. to support designers building mobile applications, research in the field of middleware systems has proliferated. middleware aims at facilitating communication and coordination of distributed components, concealing difficulties raised by mobility from application engineers as much as possible. in this survey, we examine characteristics of mobile distributed systems and distinguish them from their fixed counterpart. we introduce a framework and a categorization of the various middleware systems designed to support mobility, and we present a detailed and comparative review of the major results reached in this field. an analysis of current trends inside the mobile middleware community and a discussion of further directions of research conclude the survey.
gaze-contingent interactive visualization of high-dynamic-range imagery we propose a technique for fusing a bracketed exposure sequence into a high quality image, without converting to high dynamic range (hdr) first. skipping the physically based hdr assembly step simplifies the acquisition pipeline. this avoids camera response curve calibration and is computationally efficient. it also allows for including flash images in the sequence. our technique blends multiple exposures, guided by simple quality measures like saturation and contrast. this is done in a multiresolution fashion to account for the brightness variation in the sequence. the resulting image quality is comparable to existing tone mapping operators.
projection of the array-ol specification language onto the kahn process network computation model publisher summary this chapter discusses distributed process networks. process networks are networks of sequential processes connected by channels behaving like fifo (first in, first out) queues. these are used in signal and image processing applications that need to run in bounded memory for infinitely long periods of time dealing with possibly infinite streams of data. this chapter discusses distributed implementation of this computation model. the implementation of a distributed process network by using distributed fifos to build the distributed application is discussed. the platform used to support this is the common object request broker architecture (corba) middleware. indeed, each process of the process network can be written in a different language and run on a different hardware, provided that these are supported by the chosen object request broker (orb). in addition of the heterogeneity, implementation presents the following characteristics; automation of data transfer between distributed processes, dynamic and interactive linking of the processes to form the data flow, hybrid data-driven, demand-driven data transfer protocol, with thresholds for load balancing, and the implementation was carried out, such as to enable a distributed or local execution without any change to the program source. a process network deployment and distributed execution is described. the transfer strategies (demand and data driven) are detailed.
gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveal transcriptional signatures as novel biomarkers of cardiac remodeling in rats with aldosteronism and hypertensive heart disease. non-obese diabetic (nod) mice spontaneously develop autoimmunity to the insulin producing beta cells leading to insulin-dependent diabetes. in this study we developed and used new data analysis and mining approaches on combined proteome and transcriptome (molecular phenotype) data to define pathways affected by abnormalities in peripheral leukocytes of young nod female mice. cells were collected before mice show signs of autoimmunity (age, 2–4 weeks). we extracted both protein and rna from nod and c57bl/6 control mice to conduct both proteome analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and transcriptome analysis on affymetrix expression arrays. we developed a new approach to analyze the two-dimensional gel proteome data that included two-way analysis of variance, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis. lists of differentially expressed proteins and transcripts were subjected to pathway analysis using a commercial service. from the list of 24 proteins differentially expressed between strains we identified two highly significant and interconnected networks centered around oncogenes (myc and mycn) and apoptosis-related genes (bcl2 and casp3). the 273 genes with significant strain differences in rna expression levels created six interconnected networks with a significant over-representation of genes related to cancer, cell cycle, and cell death. they contained many of the same genes found in the proteome networks (including myc and mycn). the combination of the eight, highly significant networks created one large network of 272 genes of which 82 had differential expression between strains either at the protein or the rna level. we conclude that new proteome data analysis strategies and combined information from proteome and transcriptome can enhance the insights gained from either type of data alone. the overall systems biology of prediabetic nod mice points toward abnormalities in regulation of the opposing processes of cell renewal and cell death even before there are any clear signatures of immune system activation.
an assessment of socio-economic inequalities in health among elderly in greece, italy and spain in belgium, income-related inequality in ill-health among the 65- is present, but reduces significantly as soon as one restricts the analysis to the 65+. the main goal of this paper is to check whether these findings (based on current income) are robust to the income concept used. the analysis is repeated using estimates of permanent income. measured inequality among the 65+ remains very limited, suggesting that the observed findings are not heavily dependent upon the income concept. finally, i suggest an explanation for the observed difference in inequality between the 65- and the 65+. i argue that this difference is likely to be correlated with differences across income groups of (1) sample attrition; and (2) mortality.
a probabilistic calibration of climate sensitivity and terrestrial carbon change in genie-1 this paper describes an approach to computing probabilistic assessments of future climate, using a climate model. it clarifies the nature of probability in this context, and illustrates the kinds of judgements that must be made in order for such a prediction to be consistent with the probability calculus. the climate model is seen as a tool for making probabilistic statements about climate itself, necessarily involving an assessment of the model’s imperfections. a climate event, such as a 2^c increase in global mean temperature, is identified with a region of ‘climate-space’, and the ensemble of model evaluations is used within a numerical integration designed to estimate the probability assigned to that region.
micro-structural brain alterations in aviremic hiv+ patients with minor neurocognitive disorders: a multi-contrast study at high field objectives: to examine the association between the type and number of subjective memory complaints (smcs) and performance on objective cognitive tests.
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cyclophosphamide metabolism , liver toxicity , and mortality following we evaluated the relationship between the signs and symptoms of the clinical syndrome called veno-occlusive disease of the liver after bone marrow transplantation and the histological findings in 76 patients who later came to autopsy. coded necropsy liver was scored for individual histological features that were correlated with prospectively assessed clinical features that the patients had exhibited during life. patients were stratified into two groups: those with severe clinical veno-occlusive disease (n = 32) and those without. clinically severe veno-occlusive disease was statistically correlated with several zone 3 acinar changes: occluded hepatic venules, the frequency of occluded hepatic venules x degree of occlusion, eccentric luminal narrowing/phlebosclerosis, zone 3 sinusoidal fibrosis and zone 3 hepatocyte necrosis (all p < or = 0.03). there was a significant relationship between the number of these histological abnormalities in zone 3 of the liver acinus and a clinical diagnosis of severe veno-occlusive disease (p = 0.003). the presence of ascites was significantly correlated with occluded venules, zone 3 sinusoidal fibrosis and zone 3 hepatocyte necrosis (p = 0.001). maximum serum bilirubin in the first 20 days after transplant was significantly correlated with sinusoidal fibrosis, hepatocyte necrosis and eccentric luminal sclerosis/phlebosclerosis (p < 0.01) but not with venular occlusion. the clinical syndrome of liver toxicity (commonly called veno-occlusive disease) that results from cytoreductive therapy before bone marrow transplant is strongly correlated with a constellation of histological lesions involving structures in zone 3 of the liver acinus and the hepatic venules into which sinusoidal blood flows. this study suggests that there is no single diagnostic histological feature. the severity of clinical veno-occlusive disease appears to be proportional to the number of such histological changes and is not due solely to occlusion of small hepatic venules.
bone mineral density after implantation of a femoral neck hip prosthesis – a prospective 5 year follow-up our aim was to determine the precision of the measurements of bone mineral density (bmd) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the proximal femur before and after implantation of an uncemented implant, with particular regard to the significance of retro- and prospective studies. we examined 60 patients to determine the difference in preoperative bmd between osteoarthritic and healthy hips. the results showed a preoperative bmd of the affected hip which was lower by a mean of 4% and by a maximum of 9% compared with the opposite side. in addition, measurements were made in the operated hip before and at ten days after operation to determine the effect of the implantation of an uncemented custom-made femoral stem. the mean increase in the bmd was 8% and the maximum was 24%. previous retrospective studies have reported a marked loss of bmd on the operated side. the precision of double measurements using a special foot jig showed a modified coefficient of variation of 0.6% for the non-operated side in 15 patients and of 0.6% for the operated femur in 20 patients. the effect of rotation on the precision of the measurements after implantation of an uncemented femoral stem was determined in ten explanted femora and for the operated side in ten patients at 10 degrees rotation and in 20 patients at 30 degrees rotation. rotation within 30 degrees influenced the precision in studies in vivo and in vitro by a mean of 3% and in single cases in up to 60%. precise prediction of the degree of loss of bmd is thus only possible in prospective cross-sectional measurements, since the effect of the difference in preoperative bmd, as well as the apparent increase in bmd after implantation of an uncemented stem, is not known from retrospective studies. the dexa method is a reliable procedure for determining periprosthetic bmd when positioning and rotation are strictly controlled.

pregnancy incidence and correlates in a clinical trial preparedness study, north west province south africa background hiv prevalence and incidence among sexually active women in peri-urban areas of ladysmith, edendale, and pinetown, kwazulu-natal, south africa, were assessed between october 2007 and february 2010 in preparation for vaginal microbicide trials. methodology/principal findings sexually active women 18–35 years, not known to be hiv-positive or pregnant were tested cross-sectionally to determine hiv and pregnancy prevalence (798 in ladysmith, 1,084 in edendale, and 891 in pinetown). out of these, approximately 300 confirmed non-pregnant, hiv-negative women were subsequently enrolled at each clinical research center (crc) in a 12-month cohort study with quarterly study visits. women in the cohort studies were required to use a condom plus a hormonal contraceptive method. hiv prevalence rates in the baseline cross-sectional surveys were high: 42% in ladysmith, 46% in edendale and 41% in pinetown. around 90% of study participants at each crc reported one sex partner in the last 3 months, but only 14–30% stated that they were sure that none of their sex partners were hiv-positive. hiv incidence rates based on seroconversions over 12 months were 14.8/100 person-years (py) (95% ci 9.7, 19.8) in ladysmith, 6.3/100 py (95% ci 3.2, 9.4) in edendale, and 7.2/100 py (95% ci 3.7, 10.7) in pinetown. the 12-month pregnancy incidence rates (in the context of high reported contraceptive use) were: 5.7/100 py (95% ci 2.6, 8.7) in ladysmith, 3.1/100 py (95% ci 0.9, 5.2) in edendale and 6.3/100 py (95% ci 3.0, 9.6) in pinetown. conclusions/significance hiv prevalence and incidence remain high in peri-urban areas of kwazulu-natal.
an empirical study of gender differences in online gambling research and theory regarding the social facilitation effect generates the expectation that the presence of other gamblers (or co-actors) in a gaming venue is likely to intensify individual gambling behavior and magnify losses. fifty male and 66 female participants (116 total) played a computer-simulated electronic gaming machine with a fixed winning sequence, followed by an indefinite losing sequence. measures of the intensity of gambling behavior included the final payout (a direct measure of losses), average bet-size, number of trials played, and the speed of play. some participants received false feedback from the computer designed to suggest that other gamers in adjacent rooms were playing and sometimes winning at the same game. persons who received both sight and sound information, including winning bells and instant messages regarding the wins of other (fake) players, placed more bets and lost more money compared to the other conditions with less information.
modelling breeding habitat preferences of bonelli’s eagle (hieraaetus fasciatus) in relation to topography, disturbance, climate and land use at different spatial scales 1. to develop a conservation management plan for a species, knowledge of its distribution and spatial arrangement of preferred habitat is essential. this is a difficult task, especially when the species of concern is in low   abundance. in south-western victoria, australia, populations of the rare rufous bristlebird dasyornis broadbenti are threatened by fragmentation of suitable habitat. in order to improve the conservation status of this species, critical habitat requirements must be identified and a system of corridors must be established to link known populations. a predictive spatial model of rufous bristlebird habitat was developed in order to identify critical areas requiring preservation, such as corridors for dispersal. 2. habitat models generated using generalized linear modelling techniques can assist in delineating the specific habitat requirements of a species. coupled with geographic information system (gis) technology, these models can be extrapolated to produce maps displaying the spatial configuration of suitable habitat. 3. models were generated using logistic regression, with bristlebird presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both gis data layers and multispectral digital imagery, as the predictors. a multimodel inference approach based on akaike’s information criterion was used and the resulting model was applied in a gis to extrapolate predicted likelihood of occurrence across the entire area of concern. the predictive performance of the selected model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (roc) technique. a hierarchical partitioning protocol was used to identify the predictor variables most likely to influence variation in the dependent variable. probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability. 4. negative associations between rufous bristlebird presence and  increasing elevation, 'distance to cree', 'distance to coast' and sun index were evident, suggesting a preference for areas relatively low in altitude, in close proximity to the coastal fringe and drainage lines, and receiving less direct sunlight. a positive association with increasing habitat complexity also suggested that this species prefers areas containing high vertical density of vegetation. 5. the predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (area under the curve 0·97), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that all the variables considered had significant  independent contributions towards explaining the variation in the dependent variable. the proportion of the total study area that was predicted as suitable habitat for the rufous bristlebird (using probability of occurrence at a ≥0·5 level ) was 16%. 6. synthesis and applications. the spatial model clearly delineated areas predicted as highly suitable rufous bristlebird habitat, with evidence of potential corridors linking coastal and inland populations via gullies. conservation of this species will depend on management actions that protect the critical habitats identified in the model. a multi-scale  approach to the modelling process is recommended whereby a spatially explicit model is first generated using landscape variables extracted from a gis, and a second model at site level is developed using fine-scale habitat variables measured on the ground. where there are constraints on the time and cost involved in measuring finer scale variables, the first step alone can be used for conservation planning.
taxon richness of “megaviridae” exceeds those of bacteria and archaea in the ocean nucleo-cytoplasmic large dna viruses (ncldvs) constitute a group of eukaryotic viruses that can have crucial ecological roles in the sea by accelerating the turnover of their unicellular hosts or by causing diseases in animals. to better characterize the diversity, abundance and biogeography of marine ncldvs, we analyzed 17 metagenomes derived from microbial samples (0.2–1.6 μm size range) collected during the tara oceans expedition. the sample set includes ecosystems under-represented in previous studies, such as the arabian sea oxygen minimum zone (omz) and indian ocean lagoons. by combining computationally derived relative abundance and direct prokaryote cell counts, the abundance of ncldvs was found to be in the order of 104–105 genomes ml−1 for the samples from the photic zone and 102–103 genomes ml−1 for the omz. the megaviridae and phycodnaviridae dominated the ncldv populations in the metagenomes, although most of the reads classified in these families showed large divergence from known viral genomes. our taxon co-occurrence analysis revealed a potential association between viruses of the megaviridae family and eukaryotes related to oomycetes. in support of this predicted association, we identified six cases of lateral gene transfer between megaviridae and oomycetes. our results suggest that marine ncldvs probably outnumber eukaryotic organisms in the photic layer (per given water mass) and that metagenomic sequence analyses promise to shed new light on the biodiversity of marine viruses and their interactions with potential hosts.
effects of 17α-methyltestosterone on the reproduction of the freshwater snail biomphalaria glabrata. summary australorbis glabratus adults were placed in either 0.05 or 0.1 ppm of sodium pentachlorophenate for 7 or 8 days and the effects of this treatment on egg production and on viability of the eggs laid were determined. in general the treatment drastically reduced egg production and a very large proportion of all eggs recovered from the aquaria were dead. removal of the chemical resulted in improved egg production and egg viability. the possible significance of these results for field control of the snail vectors of schistosomiasis is discussed.
unsupervised methods for learning and using semantics of natural language work on part-of-speech tagging has concentrated on english in the past, since a lot of manually tagged training material is available for english and results can be compared to those of other researchers. it was assumed that methods which have been developed for english would work for other languages as well.1
the polyphenol oxidase gene family in land plants: lineage-specific duplication and expansion we describe muscle, a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. the speed and accuracy of muscle are compared with t-coffee, mafft and clustalw on four test sets of reference alignments: balibase, sabmark, smart and a new benchmark, prefab. muscle achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. without refinement, muscle achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from t-coffee and mafft, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. the muscle program, source code and prefab test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.

negotiating and effectuating relocation to sheltered housing in old age: a swedish study over 11 years background and aims: in order to investigate the relation between personal functional capacity and the physical housing environment during the aging process, the aim of this study was to give a long-term description of person-environmental fit (p-e fit) problems in terms of housing accessibility and adl dependence among older adults, and to study their relationships at three points in time. methods: a 10-year longitudinal design was used: baseline (1994), follow-up 1 (2000) and follow-up 2 (2004). using the swedish national population register, a baseline sample of persons aged 75–84 years was identified. of the 133 participants at baseline, the 31 participants still available at follow-up 2 were included in this study. data on housing accessibility, functional limitations and dependence in adl were collected by means of interviews and observations at home visits. results: p-e fit problems increased significantly between baseline and follow-up 1 and between follow-ups 1 and 2. no significant changes in overall adl dependence were recorded. the total number of functional limitations, dependence on walking aids and p-e fit were significantly correlated to adl dependence, at both follow-up 1 and follow-up 2, but not at baseline. conclusions: results confirm that functional decline is a major driver toward increased adl dependence during the aging process, whereas environmental barriers per se are not related to such disability. instead, p-e fit is significantly related to adl dependence, and the relationship grows stronger with advancing age.
the role of local backrub motions in evolved and designed mutations geometrical validation around the cα is described, with a new cβ measure and updated ramachandran plot. deviation of the observed cβ atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the major structure‐validation information contained in bond angle distortions. cβ deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain and backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. a new ϕ,ψ plot using density‐dependent smoothing for 81,234 non‐gly, non‐pro, and non‐prepro residues with b < 30 from 500 high‐resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. one such region is the γ‐turn conformation near +75°,−60°, counted as forbidden by common structure‐validation programs; however, it occurs in well‐ordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the γ‐turn h‐bond. favored and allowed ϕ,ψ regions are also defined for pro, pre‐pro, and gly (important because gly ϕ,ψ angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of α‐helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. a proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two‐peptide nhs permits donating only a single h‐bond. new calculations by hu et al.

treatment and prevention of urinary tract infection with orally active fimh inhibitors fimbriae are proteinogeneous appendages on the surface of bacteria, which mediate bacterial adhesion to the host cell glycocalyx. the so-called type 1 fimbriae exhibit specificity for alpha-d-mannosides and, therefore, they are assumed to mediate bacterial adhesion via the interaction of a fimbrial lectin and alpha-d-mannosyl residues exposed on the host cell surface. this carbohydrate-specific adhesive protein subunit of type 1 fimbriae has been identified as a protein called fimh. the crystal structure of this lectin is known and, based on this information, the molecular details of the interaction of mannoside ligands and fimh are addressed in this paper. computer-based docking methods were used to evaluate known ligands as well as to design new ones. then, a series of new mannosides with extended aglycon was synthesized and tested as inhibitors of type 1 fimbriae-mediated bacterial adhesion in an elisa. the results obtained were compared to the predictions and findings as delivered by molecular modeling. this study led to an improved understanding of the ligand-receptor interactions under investigation.
the competence gene, comf, from synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803 is involved in natural transformation, phototactic motility and piliation. proteins from silver-stained gels can be digested enzymatically and the resulting peptide analyzed and sequenced by mass spectrometry. standard proteins yield the same peptide maps when extracted from coomassie- and silver-stained gels, as judged by electrospray and maldi mass spectrometry. the low nanogram range can be reached by the protocols described here, and the method is robust. a silver-stained one-dimensional gel of a fraction from yeast proteins was analyzed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. in the sequencing, more than 1000 amino acids were covered, resulting in no evidence of chemical modifications due to the silver staining procedure. silver staining allows a substantial shortening of sample preparation time and may, therefore, be preferable over coomassie staining. this work removes a major obstacle to the low-level sequence analysis of proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels.
calmodulin and protein kinase c regulate gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells. churchill, grant c., monica m. lurtz, and charles f. louis. ca21 regulation of gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells. am j physiol cell physiol 281: c972–c981, 2001.—the quantitative effects of ca21 signaling on gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells have been determined using either the spread of mn21 that is imaged by its ability to quench the fluorescence of fura 2 or the spread of the fluorescent dye alexa fluor 594. gap junctional coupling was unaffected by a mechanically stimulated cell-to-cell ca21 wave. furthermore, when cytosolic ca21 concentration (cai ) increased after the addition of the agonist atp, coupling was unaffected during the period that cai 21 was maximal. however, coupling decreased transiently ;5–10 min after agonist addition when cai 21 returned to resting levels, indicating that this transient decrease in coupling was unlikely due to a direct action of cai 21 on gap junctions. an increase in cai 21 mediated by the ionophore ionomycin that was sustained for several minutes resulted in a more rapid and sustained decrease in coupling (ic50 ;300 nm ca21, hill coefficient of 4), indicating that an increase in cai 21 alone could regulate gap junctions. thus cai 21 increases that occurred during agonist stimulation and cell-to-cell ca21 waves were too transient to mediate a sustained uncoupling of lens epithelial cells.
predicting rna-protein interactions using only sequence information the protein–rna interface database (pridb) is a comprehensive database of protein–rna interfaces extracted from complexes in the protein data bank (pdb). it is designed to facilitate detailed analyses of individual protein–rna complexes and their interfaces, in addition to automated generation of user-defined data sets of protein–rna interfaces for statistical analyses and machine learning applications. for any chosen pdb complex or list of complexes, pridb rapidly displays interfacial amino acids and ribonucleotides within the primary sequences of the interacting protein and rna chains. pridb also identifies prosite motifs in protein chains and fr3d motifs in rna chains and provides links to these external databases, as well as to structure files in the pdb. an integrated jmol applet is provided for visualization of interacting atoms and residues in the context of the 3d complex structures. the current version of pridb contains structural information regarding 926 protein–rna complexes available in the pdb (as of 10 october 2010). atomic- and residue-level contact information for the entire data set can be downloaded in a simple machine-readable format. also, several non-redundant benchmark data sets of protein–rna complexes are provided. the pridb database is freely available online at http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/pridb.
simultaneous multiphase image segmentation and cartoon-texture decomposition we present a new variational model for the soft multiphase image segmentation. in the model, we introduce a nonconvex regularizer on the membership functions which are used as indicators of different homogeneous regions. the nonconvex regularizer performs better than the usual convex ones in that (i) it well preserves geometric shapes of the homogeneous regions, and (ii) it protects edges from oversmoothing which is a common drawback of the convex regularizer. to solve the nonconvex minimization problem, we design a new fast alternative iteration algorithm, which is robust to the setting of the parameters in the model. we conduct comprehensive experiments to measure the performance of the algorithm in terms of visual evaluation and a variety of quantitative indices for image segmentation. the algorithm achieves more accurate results compared to other well-known convex variational methods for image segmentation.
clinical factors influencing the efficacy of systemic moxifloxacin in the therapy of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis: a multilevel analysis from a clinical trial aim the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of moxifloxacin (mox) in one-stage scaling and root planing (srp) in treating generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp).   materials and methods forty subjects were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. the two treatment groups consisted of srp combined with systemically administered mox at the dosage of 400 mg once daily for 7 days or srp + placebo once daily for 7 days. subgingival plaque samples were analysed for cultivable bacteria.   results both groups resulted in significant reduction of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) compared with baseline (p < 0.0001), and this difference was maintained at 6 months from baseline in both groups. however, subjects receiving mox showed the greatest improvements cal, and pd. subjects in both groups at 6 months displayed the greatest reduction from baseline in frequency of sites with pd ≥ 6 mm (p < 0.001), favouring the mox group. adjunctive antibiotic protocol reduced subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to undetectable levels, after 3 and 6 months, and there was a significant reduction in the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia in the mox group compared to the placebo group.   conclusions the results from this study suggest that moxifloxacin as and adjunct to one-stage full-mouth srp leads to a better clinical and microbiological advantages compared to mechanical treatment.
a new approach to affordable and reliable cardiology pacs architecture using open-source technology the first interoperability demonstration of the cardiology profiles of the "integrating the healthcare enterprise" (ihe) initiative was held in conjunction with the annual scientific sessions of the american college of cardiology (acc) in march, 2005. the ihe cardiology planning committee identified clinical problems to be addressed: the ability to view an ecg from anywhere in the enterprise, and the effective integration of patient, order and procedure information for echocardiography and for cardiac catheterization. the ihe cardiology technical committee developed a set of integration profiles to address the retrieval and display of ecg's as well as scheduled and unscheduled echo and cath for registered and unregistered patients. the demonstration used clinical scenarios to demonstrate the integration of the participating systems: (1) emergent angioplasty (2) change of procedure room; (3) add-on mobile echo procedure; and (4) stress echo images
learning to rank query suggestions for adhoc and diversity search the trec web track explores and evaluates web retrieval technology over large collections of web data. in its current incarnation, the web track has been active since trec 2009, where it included both a traditional adhoc retrieval task and a new diversity task [4]. the goal of this diversity task is to return a ranked list of pages that together provide complete coverage for a query, while avoiding excessive redundancy in the result list. for trec 2010 the track introduced a new web spam task and web-style, six-level relevance assessment for the adhoc task [5]. for trec 2011, as recommended by participants at the track planning session held during trec 2010, we dropped the spam task but continued the other tasks essentially unchanged. as we did for trec 2009 and trec 2010, we based our trec 2011 experiments on the billion-page clueweb09 collection created by the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university. the tasks use a common topic set, differing only in their evaluation methodology. topics are created from the logs of a commercial search engine, with the aid of tools developed at microsoft research [9]. given a target query, these tools extract and analyze groups of related queries, using co-clicks and other information, to identify clusters of queries that highlight different aspects and interpretations of the target query. these clusters are employed by nist for topic development. each resulting topic is structured as a representative set of subtopics, each related to a different user need. the selection of subtopics attempts to reflect a mix of genuine user requirements for the topic. for the adhoc task documents are judged with respect to the topic as a whole. relevance levels are similar in structure to the levels used in commercial web search, including a spam/junk level. moreover, the top two levels of the assessment structure are closely related to the homepage finding and topic distillation tasks appearing in older web tracks. for the diversity task, documents are judged with respect to the subtopics, as well as with respect to the topic as a whole. for trec 2011, the topic selection process was modified slightly from previous years. for trec 2009 and 2010, topics were chosen to be of medium-to-high frequency. trec 2011 attempts to work with more obscure topics, which may still be underspecified (i.e., faceted) but may be less ambiguous. search engines have difficulty with queries of this type, since they can rely less on click/anchor information, and popularity signals like pagerank. with these new tough topics we hope to work in an area of web retrieval that has received relatively little attention. given the smaller number of pages that may be relevant for these tough topics, we may potentially be able to create a more reusable collection, with sufficiently complete judgments.
are severe musculoskeletal injuries associated with symptoms of common mental disorders among male european professional footballers? this article reports on the development of short forms from the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (promis™) sleep disturbance (sd) and sleep-related impairment (sri) item banks. results from post-hoc computerized adaptive testing (cat) simulations, item discrimination parameters, item means, and clinical judgments were used to select the best-performing 8 items for sd and sri. the final 8-item short forms provided less test information than the corresponding full banks, but correlated strongly with the longer forms. the short forms had greater measurement precision than the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) and the epworth sleepiness scale (ess), as indicated by larger test information values across the continuum of severity, despite having fewer total items—a major advantage for both research and clinical settings.
molecular analysis of duck hepatitis virus type 1 reveals a novel lineage close to the genus parechovirus in the family picornaviridae. the abbreviated name, 'mfold web server', describes a number of closely related software applications available on the world wide web (www) for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded nucleic acids. the objective of this web server is to provide easy access to rna and dna folding and hybridization software to the scientific community at large. by making use of universally available web guis (graphical user interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of portability of this software. detailed output, in the form of structure plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency plots and 'energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single sequences. a variety of 'bulk' servers give less information, but in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. the portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold. this url will be referred to as 'mfoldroot'.
acneiform rash due to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors: high-level laser therapy as an innovative approach background the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (lllt) as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy of smoking and non-smoking patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis.   methods all 36 systemically healthy patients who were included in the study initially received non-surgical periodontal therapy. the lllt group (n = 18) received gaalas diode laser therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy. a diode laser with a wavelength of 808 nm was used for the lllt. energy density of 4 j/cm(2) was applied to the gingival surface after periodontal treatment on the first, second, and seventh days. each of the lllt and control groups was divided into two groups as smoking and non-smoking patients to investigate the effect of smoking on treatment. gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from all patients and clinical parameters were recorded on baseline, the first, third, and sixth months after treatment. matrix metalloproteinase-1, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1, transforming growth factor-β1, and basic-fibroblast growth factor levels in the collected gingival crevicular fluid were measured.   results the primary outcome variable in this study was change in gingival bleeding and inflammation. at all time points, the lllt group showed significantly more improvement in sulcus bleeding index (sbi), clinical attachment level, and probing depth (pd) levels compared to the control group (p <0.001). there were clinically significant improvements in the laser-applied smokers' pd and sbi levels compared to smokers to whom a laser was not applied, between the baseline and all time points (p <0.001) (sbi score: control group 1.12, lllt group 1.49; pd: control group 1.21 mm, lllt group 1.46 mm, between baseline and 6 months). transforming growth factor-β1 levels and the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-1 to tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 decreased significantly in both groups at 1, 3, and 6 months after periodontal therapy (p <0.001). basic-fibroblast growth factor levels significantly decreased in both groups in the first month after the treatment, then increased in the third and sixth months (p <0.005). no marker level change showed significant differences between the groups (p <0.05).   conclusion lllt as an adjunctive therapy to non-surgical periodontal treatment improves periodontal healing.
rac3 influences the chemoresistance of colon cancer cells through autophagy and apoptosis inhibition rac3 is an oncogene naturally overexpressed in several tumors. besides its role as coactivator, it can exert several protumoral cytoplasmic actions. autophagy was found to act either as a tumor suppressor during the early stages of tumor development, or as a protector of the tumor cell in later stages under hypoxic conditions. we found that rac3 overexpression inhibits autophagy when induced by starvation or rapamycin and involves rac3 nuclear translocation‐dependent and ‐independent mechanisms. moreover, hypoxia inhibits the rac3 gene expression leading to the autophagy process, allowing tumor cells to survive until angiogenesis occurs. the interplay between rac3, hypoxia, and autophagy could be an important mechanism for tumor progression and a good target for a future anticancer therapy.
operator based multicomponent am-fm signal separation approach the operator-based signal separation approach uses an adaptive operator to separate a signal into additive subcomponents. the approach can be formulated as an optimization problem whose optimal solution can be derived analytically. however, the following issues must still be resolved: estimating the robustness of the operator's parameters and the lagrangian multipliers, and determining how much of the information in the null space of the operator should be retained in the residual signal. to address these problems, we propose a novel optimization formula for operator-based signal separation and show that the parameters of the problem can be estimated adaptively. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by processing several signals, including real-life signals.
the willingness of us pediatric dentists to use atraumatic restorative treatment (art) with their patients: a conjoint analysis. objectives service provision varies by dentist, practice and patient factors. however, limited subsets of these potential influences on service rates have been explored. more comprehensive models could improve our understanding of the factors influencing the pattern of care delivered. the aim of this study was to examine variation in dental services by dentist (treatment choice, practice beliefs, preferences for patients, demographics), practice (type, location, size and volume of practice) and patient (visit, demographic, oral health and socio-economic) characteristics.   methods a random sample of australian dentists was surveyed in 1997-98 (response rate=60.3%). private general practitioners (n=345) provided dentist and practice data, and service provision and patient variables were collected from a log of a typical clinical day (n=4,115 patients). multivariate negative binomial regression models were fitted for diagnostic, preventive, restorative, extraction and prosthodontic services.   results significant dentist factors included (p<0.05; rr=rate ratio): lower diagnostic rates (rr=0.78) for dentists with stronger practice beliefs for giving information about cost and treatment options; preventive rates were lower (rr=0.74) for male dentists and higher (rr=1.48) for younger dentists aged 20-29 years; restorative rates were higher (rr=1.27) for dentists that rated patient preferences more highly in treatment choice and in the dentist age group 30-39 years (rr=1.25); extraction rates were lower (rr=0.61) for dentists with stronger preferences for patients that would adhere with treatment but higher (rr=1.57) for dentists with stronger preferences for sociable patients; and prosthodontic rates were lower (rr=0.38) for dentists with stronger preferences for adaptable patients who were willing to cooperate when expected to do so. practice factors included: higher preventive (rr=1.28) and prosthodontic rates (rr=2.07) in solo practice; higher preventive (rr=1.34) but lower prosthodontic rates (rr=0.42) in capital cities; lower diagnostic (rr=0.82) and extraction rates (rr=0.55) in practices with fewer other dentists; higher diagnostic (rr=1.33) and extraction (rr=1.62) rates but lower restorative rates (rr=0.84) in practices with lower patient visits per year. patient factors included: lower preventive (rr=0.76) but higher extraction rates (rr=1.45) for emergency visits; lower extraction rates (rr=0.60) for the insured; higher diagnostic rates (rr=1.17) for new patients; higher restorative (rr=1.31) but lower prosthodontic rates (rr=0.46) for patients with decayed teeth; higher prosthodontic rates (rr=2.14) for those with dentures; and lower preventive (rr=0.66), but higher extraction (rr=2.22) and prosthodontic rates (rr=1.82) for patients from lower socio-economic status areas.   conclusions dental service rates were influenced by large number of small effects from a wide range of dentist, practice and patient factors. socio-economic and geographic barriers may need broad policy innovations to be addressed, but factors such as insurance and visit type have the potential to be altered to achieve better service outcomes and there is scope for research into clinical outcomes to improve the knowledge upon which treatment decisions are based.
verification of parameterized concurrent programs by modular reasoning about data and control we consider the verification of parameterized boolean programs— abstractions of shared-memory concurrent programs with an unbounded number of threads we propose that such programs can be model-checked by iteratively considering the program under k-round schedules, for increasing values of k, using a novel compositional construct called linear interfaces that summarize the effect of a block of threads in a k-round schedule we also develop a game-theoretic sound technique to show that k rounds of schedule suffice to explore the entire search-space, which allows us to prove a parameterized program entirely correct we implement a symbolic model-checker, and report on experiments verifying parameterized predicate abstractions of linux device drivers interacting with a kernel to show the efficacy of our technique.
using photomosaic and steganographic techniques for hiding information inside image mosaics the main aim of the paper is to analyze about security in image transfer through the network. secret- fragment-visible mosaic image is proposed for combining small tiles of secret image to form a target in the sense of mosaic. when this artwork is viewed at close, the observer can view smaller elements, yet when viewed at a distance the collection of tiles blend together to yield the overall picture. when the mosaic generating process starts, original image is divided into many tiles. before splitting the image, compare the image for mosaic creation. mosaic image is created automatically by composing small fragments of a given image in to target image, achieving an effect of embedding the given source image secretly in the resulting mosaic image. to create the mosaic image, first find the similar target image for selected source image. finding the best fit tile for embedding in the target image blocks. the information of placing the tile image fitting sequence in target image is embedding into random selected pixel in created mosaic image. the embedded information act as a text key file. the key file contains the tile image fitting sequence. without this key receiver can't retrieve the secret image.
expression of fura is modulated by ntca and strongly enhanced in heterocysts of anabaena sp. pcc 7120. the fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein is a global regulator in most prokaryotes that controls a large number of genes. fur is a classical repressor that uses ferrous iron as co-repressor and binds to specific dna sequences (iron boxes) as a dimer. three different genes coding for fur homologues have been identified in anabaena sp. pcc 7120. fura controls the transcription of flavodoxin, the product of the isib gene, and is moderately autoregulated. in this work, the promoter of the fura gene was defined and the fura protected regions in the fura and isib promoters were identified, showing that the binding sites for anabaena fura contain a/t-rich sequences with a variable arrangement compared to the conventional 19-base pair fur consensus. the influence of different factors on the interaction between fura and the promoters was evaluated in vitro. the affinity of fura for the dna targets was significantly affected by the redox status of this regulator and the presence of mn2+. the optimal binding conditions were observed in the presence of both mn2+ and dtt. those results suggest that, in addition to iron availability, fura–dna interaction is modulated by redox conditions.
expression profiling of the lignin biosynthetic pathway in norway spruce using est sequencing and real-time rt-pcr the gene ontology project (http://www.geneontology.org/) produces structured, controlled vocabularies and gene product annotations. gene products are classified according to the cellular locations and biological process in which they act, and the molecular functions that they carry out. we annotate gene products from a broad range of model species and provide support for those groups that wish to contribute annotation of further model species. the gene ontology facilitates the exchange of information between groups of scientists studying similar processes in different model organisms, and so provides a broad range of opportunities for plant scientists.
statement by an american association of clinical endocrinologists/american college of endocrinology consensus panel on type 2 diabetes mellitus: an algorithm for glycemic control. the evidence-based canadian diabetes association (cda) 2008 clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of diabetes in canada (1) differ from the consensus statement by nathan et al. (2), although both were published virtually at the same time. the consensus statement, which represents the authors’ collective analysis, evaluation, and opinion, is said not to represent official association opinion, yet it is listed as a consensus statement of the american diabetes association and the european association for the study of diabetes. in contrast, the cda clinical practice guidelines do represent the cda's official position. the cda clinical practice guidelines follow the agree (appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation) instrument (3) and have a standardized evidence-based approach to …
talin autoinhibition is required for morphogenesis the mammalian focal adhesion kinase (fak) family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases has been implicated in controlling a multitude of cellular responses to the engagement of cell-surface integrins and g-protein-coupled receptors. the high level of sequence conservation between the mammalian proteins and the drosophila homologue of fak, fak56, suggested that it would have similar functions. however, we show here that drosophila fak56 is not essential for integrin functions in adhesion, migration or signaling in vivo. furthermore, animals lacking fak56 are viable and fertile, demonstrating that fak56 is not essential for other developmental or physiological functions. despite this, overexpressed fak56 is a potent inhibitor of integrins binding to the extracellular matrix, suggesting that fak56 may play a subtle role in the negative regulation of integrin adhesion.
promoter protection by a transcription factor acting as a local topological homeostat the escherichia coli dna‐binding protein fis serves as a dna architectural factor in two unrelated enzymatic reactions, the site‐specific inversion of dna and transcriptional activation of stable rna promoters. in both these processes, fis facilitates the assembly and dynamic transitions of two structurally distinct nucleoprotein complexes. we have proposed previously that, in these systems, fis stabilizes writhed dna microloops by binding at multiple helically phased sites in dna. however, fis also binds and bends dna at many non‐specific sites and, at its maximum levels in the early exponential phase, fis could potentially occupy a considerable part of the e. coli chromosome. here, we show that fis affects growth phase‐specific alterations in the supercoiling level of dna. expression of fis accelerates the accumulation of moderately supercoiled plasmids in stationary phase, which are stabilized by fis after nutritional shift‐up. in accordance with such a function, fis modulates the relaxing and supercoiling activities of topoisomerases in vitro in a way that keeps dna in a moderately supercoiled state. our results suggest that the primary role of fis is to modulate chromosomal dynamics during bacterial growth.
regional gray matter density associated with cognitive reflectivity–impulsivity: evidence from voxel-based morphometry in this study, we describe a psychobiological model of the structure and development of personality that accounts for dimensions of both temperament and character. previous research has confirmed four dimensions of temperament: novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence, and persistence, which are independently heritable, manifest early in life, and involve preconceptual biases in perceptual memory and habit formation. for the first time, we describe three dimensions of character that mature in adulthood and influence personal and social effectiveness by insight learning about self-concepts. self-concepts vary according to the extent to which a person identifies the self as (1) an autonomous individual, (2) an integral part of humanity, and (3) an integral part of the universe as a whole. each aspect of self-concept corresponds to one of three character dimensions called self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence, respectively. we also describe the conceptual background and development of a self-report measure of these dimensions, the temperament and character inventory. data on 300 individuals from the general population support the reliability and structure of these seven personality dimensions. we discuss the implications for studies of information processing, inheritance, development, diagnosis, and treatment.
organizational and informational system factors in post-merger technology integration abstract the process of integrating information systems (is) during corporate mergers can be critical to their success. factors that can support or impede the successful integration of is include organizational and is attributes, organizational merger management and is integration activities. this study develops a conceptual framework for measuring is integration success and identifies the factors influencing it. a field survey investigates the relationship between these factors and success. according to the results of our field survey of cios, prior merger experience, is participation in merger planning, the quality of merger planning, the criteria used for setting is integration priorities, and a high level of data sharing across applications appear to have a positive influence on the success of the is integration. when changes that directly affect personnel have a significant impact, that impact seems to be mostly negative. programming language incompatibilities also have a negative impact on is integration success.
systems genetics of the lateral septal nucleus in mouse: heritability, genetic control, and covariation with behavioral and morphological traits backgroundquantitative trait locus (qtl) mapping identifies genomic regions that likely contain genes regulating a quantitative trait. however, qtl regions may encompass tens to hundreds of genes. to find the most promising candidate genes that regulate the trait, the biologist typically collects information from multiple resources about the genes in the qtl interval. this process is very laborious and time consuming.resultsqtlminer is a bioinformatics tool that automatically performs qtl region analysis. it is available in genenetwork and it integrates information such as gene annotation, gene expression and sequence polymorphisms for all the genes within a given genomic interval.conclusionsqtlminer substantially speeds up discovery of the most promising candidate genes within a qtl region.
concurrent and predictive validity of components of disordered thinking in schizophrenia. behavioral data on a large patient group were collected by investigators from nine countries in the international pilot study of schizophrenia, sponsored by the world health organization. the data on half the group were analyzed to derive a system of 12 signs and symptoms for the identification of schizophrenia, as this disorder is diagnosed in many centers throughout the world. the findings were replicated with the other half of the patient group. the criteria constitute an operational method for identifying patients who would be commonly considered schizophrenic in many centers.
pattern association and consolidation emerges from connectivity properties between cortex and hippocampus we present a minimal spiking network that can polychronize, that is, exhibit reproducible time-locked but not synchronous firing patterns with millisecond precision, as in synfire braids. the network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (stdp); a ready-to-use matlab code is included. it exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. due to the interplay between the delays and stdp, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. to our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. we speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (tngs, neural darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as attention to memories.
obstructive sleep apnea as a risk factor for postoperative complications after revision joint arthroplasty. administrative databases are increasingly used for studying outcomes of medical care. valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. we adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on international classification of diseases (icd-9-cm) diagnosis and procedure codes. the association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). the index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. these associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. they also persisted after controlling for patient age. we conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.
simplified primer design for pcr-based gene targeting and microarray primer database: two web tools for fission yeast we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast (schizosaccharomyces pombe), which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote: 4,824. the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases (kb) and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 1.8-kb element. regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly reflecting more-extended control regions. some 43% of the genes contain introns, of which there are 4,730. fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes; half of these are cancer related. we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton, compartmentation, cell-cycle control, proteolysis, protein phosphorylation and rna splicing. these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life. few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified, suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization.
crucial role of rho-nuclear factor-kappab axis in angiotensin ii-induced renal injury. angiotensin ii (ang ii) is now believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs). several g(i)- and g(q)-coupled receptors, including the ang ii type 1 (at(1)) receptor, activate rho and rho-associated kinase in swiss 3t3 cells and cardiac myocytes. however, little is known about the role of rho-kinase in ang ii-induced vascular hypertrophy in vsmcs. in the present study, we explored the role of rho and rho-kinase in ang ii-induced protein synthesis in vsmcs. in unstimulated cells, rhoa was observed predominantly in the cytosolic fraction, but it was translocated in part to the particulate fraction in response to ang ii (100 nmol/l). this effect was completely blocked by the at(1) receptor blocker candesartan but not by the ang ii type 2 (at(2)) receptor antagonist pd123319. botulinum c(3) exoenzyme, which inactivated rhoa, attenuated ang ii-induced [(3)h]leucine incorporation. the specific rho-kinase inhibitor, y-27632, dose-dependently abolished ang ii-induced protein synthesis and also suppressed ang ii-induced c-fos mrna expression. on the other hand, y-27632 had no effect on ang ii-stimulated phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which are reported to be involved in ang ii-induced protein synthesis, nor had it any effect on the ang ii-induced phosphorylation of phas-i, a heat- and acid-stable eif-4e-binding protein. the phosphorylation of phas-i is regulating for translation initiation. these observations suggest that the rho, rho-kinase, and c-fos pathways may play a role in ang ii-induced hypertrophic changes of vsmcs through a novel pathway.
from block-based ensembles to online learners in changing data streams : if-and how-to most machine learning algorithms assume stationary environments, require a large number of training examples in advance, and begin the learning from scratch. in contrast, humans learn in changing environments with sequential training examples and leverage prior knowledge in new situations. to deal with real-world problems in changing environments, the ability to make human-like quick responses must be developed in machines.    many researchers have presented learning systems that assume the presence of hidden context and concept drift. in particular, several systems have been proposed that use ensembles of classifiers on sequential chunks of training examples. these systems can respond to gradual changes in large-scale data streams but have problems responding to sudden changes and leveraging prior knowledge of recurring contexts. moreover, these are not pure online learning systems.    we propose an online learning system that uses an ensemble of classifiers suited to recent training examples. we use experiments to show that this system can leverage prior knowledge of recurring contexts and is robust against various noise levels and types of drift.
image defocus and altered retinal gene expression in chick: clues to the pathogenesis of ametropia. (1) we studied the influence of photoperiod and unilateral lid suture on post-natal ocular growth in two types of white leghorn chicks previously reported to respond differently to visual deprivation, truslow and cornell k chicks. we analyzed the chicks after 2 weeks of rearing, a time period commonly used in neuropharmacological studies of eye growth but much shorter than in most prior studies of photoperiod effects on the chick eye. (2) altering the photoperiod length significantly influenced the refraction and growth of both open and sutured eyes even at this early time, with differences between the two types of chicks. (3) the most prominent effect on the open eyes was the development of hyperopia with rearing under constant light, a response especially prominent in the cornell k chicks. in the open eyes under this condition, the anterior chamber shallowed and the vitreous chamber elongated in the axial dimension only, reciprocal changes that resulted in no net alteration of axial length at 2 weeks. a high variability in refraction of open eyes reared with constant illumination suggests the need for a dark period in the regulation of eye growth. (4) compared to contralateral open eyes, the lid-sutured eyes of both types of chicks developed longer total axial lengths and enlarged vitreous chambers in both axial and equatorial dimensions under each photoperiod. the effects on anterior chamber depth and refraction were complex and differed between the two types of chicks. (5) the responses in open eyes support the notion that growth of the vitrious chamber of the chick eye is differentially regulated in the axial and equatorial dimensions, previously indicated by pharmacological studies. the responses in both open and sutured eyes indicate different control mechanisms for anterior chamber and vitreous cavity growth.
which way and how far? tracking of translation and rotation information for human path integration cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. however, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. this poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. in such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. from a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p<.01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. we illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fmri dataset from our laboratory (n=33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fmri findings. to avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p<.001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. we also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.
forest loss and matrix composition are the major drivers shaping dung beetle assemblages in a fragmented rainforest contrary to common belief, decomposition of diversity into independent richness and evenness components is mathematically impossible. however, richness can be decomposed into independent diversity and evenness or inequality components. the evenness or inequality component derived in this way is connected to most of the common measures of evenness and inequality in ecology and economics. this perspective justifies the derivation of measures of relative evenness, which give the amount of evenness relative to the maximum and minimum possible for a given richness. pielou’s [1] evenness measure j is shown to be such a measure.
the impact of women’s education, workforce experience, and the one child policy on fertility in china: a census study in guangdong, china this paper presents a data set that improves the measurement of educational attainment for a broad group of countries. we extend our previous estimates of educational attainment for the population over age 15 and over age 25 up to 1995 and provide projections for 2000. we discuss the estimation method for the measures of educational attainment and relate our estimates to alternative international measures of human capital stocks.
is gaze following purely reflexive or goal-directed instead? revisiting the automaticity of orienting attention by gaze cues in this study we investigated the tendency of humans to imitate the gaze direction of other individuals. distracting gaze stimuli or non biological directional cues (arrows) were presented to observers performing an instructed saccadic eye movement task. eye movement recordings showed that observers performed less accurately when the distracting gaze and the instructed saccade had opposite directions, with a substantial number of saccades matching the direction of the distracting gaze. static (experiment 1) and dynamic (experiment 2) gaze distracters, but not pointing arrows (experiment 3), produced the effect. results show a strong predisposition of humans to imitate somebody else's oculomotor behaviour, even when detrimental to task performance. this is likely linked to a strong tendency to share attentional states of other individuals, known as joint attention.
evaluating the psychometric properties of the attitudes towards depression and its treatments scale in an australian sample objective to develop and psychometrically assess an instrument to measure patients' attitudes towards depression, to its treatments, and aspects of professional help in patients suffering from depression.   method a 27 item likert type instrument was developed and written based on an evidence from a literature review and in consultation with experts in depression. psychiatrists (n=12) participated in a validation process of the instrument before it was administered to outpatients (n=63) suffering from non-psychotic depression.   results internal consistency reliability for the instrument was 0.79 (cronbach's alpha) and there was 88% overall agreement between experts about the relevance of the instruments' items to test patients' attitudes to depression and its treatments, providing evidence for content validity. factor analysis resulted in five cohesive and theoretically meaningful factors: 1) acceptance of treatment, 2) perceived stigma and shame, 3) negative attitude towards antidepressants, 4) self stigma, and 5) preference for psychotherapy.   conclusion the developed instrument is a reliable, valid and empirical measure to assess attitudes towards depression and its treatments. future research should be designed to replicate and extend the present findings with larger and more heterogeneous samples.

g2 phase arrest prevents bristle progenitor self-renewal and synchronizes cell division with cell fate differentiation the drosophila bristle lineage is an excellent system in which to study how cell cycle and fate determination are synchronized in invariant cell lineages. in this model, five different cells arise from a single precursor cell, pi, after four asymmetric cell divisions. cell diversity is achieved by the asymmetric segregation of cell determinants, such as numb and neuralized (neur), resulting in differential activation of the notch (n) pathway. we show that down-regulation of cdc2, by over-expressing tribbles, dwee1, and dmyt1 (three negative regulators of cdc2) or by using thermo-sensitive cdc2 mutant flies, delayed pi mitosis, and altered the polarity and the number of subsequent cell divisions. these modifications were associated with a mother-daughter cell fate transformation as the pi cell acquired the identity of the secondary precursor cell, piib. this type of change in cell identity only occurred when the n signaling pathway was inactive since ectopic n signaling transformed pi to piia-progeny fate. these transformations in cell identity suggest that, although synchronized, cell cycle and fate determination are independent phenomena in the bristle lineage.
oscillatory potentials and the b-wave: partial masking and interdependence in dark adaptation and diabetes in the rat to evaluate the effect of a long period of dark adaptation on the light-adapted electroretinogram (erg), photopic ergs were recorded before (light-adapted) and immediately after (light-readapted) 15 minutes of dark adaptation. the amplitude of the b-wave in the light-readapted erg was 48% +/- 4% of that in the light-adapted erg, and the peak time of the b-wave in the light-readapted erg was delayed by an average of 3.49 +/- 1.09 ms. segmental analysis of the b-wave showed that the last segment of the ascending limb of the b-wave (from the second oscillatory potential [op] to the peak) was attenuated the most (61% +/- 8%). in fact, the reduction in the amplitude of the last segment alone accounted for more than 60% +/- 13% of the overall reduction observed for the entire b-wave. this last segment appears to correspond to op4 in the 100- to 1000-hz recordings. the amplitude of op4 in the light-readapted erg was 56.5% +/- 10% of that in the light-adapted erg, a similar reduction to that observed for the last segment of the 1- to 1000-hz b-wave. the results strongly support the concept that the b-wave of the photopic erg may actually represent a composite of potentials whose individual contributions are best visualized when the erg is recorded with the 100- to 1000-hz bandwidth.
review of a causal role of fructose-containing sugars in myocardial susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury. rodents are widely used to mimic human diseases to improve understanding of the causes and progression of disease symptoms and to test potential therapeutic interventions. chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension, together known as the metabolic syndrome, are causing increasing morbidity and mortality. to control these diseases, research in rodent models that closely mimic the changes in humans is essential. this review will examine the adequacy of the many rodent models of metabolic syndrome to mimic the causes and progression of the disease in humans. the primary criterion will be whether a rodent model initiates all of the signs, especially obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dysfunction of the heart, blood vessels, liver and kidney, primarily by diet since these are the diet-induced signs in humans with metabolic syndrome. we conclude that the model that comes closest to fulfilling this criterion is the high carbohydrate, high fat-fed male rodent.
input stage-1 : regression stage-2 : contextual copy-pasting qi pi [ ] ... pixel representation we introduce an approach that leverages surface normal predictions, along with appearance cues, to retrieve 3d models for objects depicted in 2d still images from a large cad object library. critical to the success of our approach is the ability to recover accurate surface normals for objects in the depicted scene. we introduce a skip-network model built on the pre-trained oxford vgg convolutional neural network (cnn) for surface normal prediction. our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the nyuv2 rgb-d dataset for surface normal prediction, and recovers fine object detail compared to previous methods. furthermore, we develop a two-stream network over the input image and predicted surface normals that jointly learns pose and style for cad model retrieval. when using the predicted surface normals, our two-stream network matches prior work using surface normals computed from rgb-d images on the task of pose prediction, and achieves state of the art when using rgb-d input. finally, our two-stream network allows us to retrieve cad models that better match the style and pose of a depicted object compared with baseline approaches.
high-for-low and low-for-high: efficient boundary detection from deep object features and its applications to high-level vision this paper proposes a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful method which combines the effectiveness of a discriminative object detector with the explicit correspondence offered by a nearest-neighbor approach. the method is based on training a separate linear svm classifier for every exemplar in the training set. each of these exemplar-svms is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. while each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such exemplar-svms offers surprisingly good generalization. our performance on the pascal voc detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. but the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3d model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding.
prediction of outcome in the vegetative state by machine learning algorithms: a model for clinicians? we introduce a new accuracy index for receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves, namely the partial area under the binormal roc graph over any specified region of interest. we propose a simple but general procedure, based on a conventional analysis of variance, for comparing accuracy indices derived from two or more different modalities. the proposed method is related to and compared with existing methodology, and is illustrated by results from an experiment on optimization of density and contrast yielded by multiform photographic images used for scintigraphy.
where are linear feature extraction methods applicable? we develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. we take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3d linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a lambertian surface without shadowing. however, since faces are not truly lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. our projection method is based on fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. the eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed "fisherface" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the harvard and yale face databases.
understanding uncertainties in non-linear population trajectories: a bayesian semi-parametric hierarchical approach to large-scale surveys of coral cover photosystem ii (psii) herbicides are used in large quantities on agricultural lands adjoining the great barrier reef (gbr). routine monitoring at 14 sites in inshore waters of the gbr using passive sampling techniques detected diuron (32-94% of sampling periods) at maximum concentrations of 1.7-430ng l(-1) in the relatively pristine cape york region to the mackay whitsunday region, respectively. a psii herbicide equivalent (psii-heq) index developed as an indicator for reporting was dominated by diuron (average contribution 89%) and typically increased during the wet season. the maximum psii-heq indicates the potential for photosynthetic inhibition of diatoms, seagrass and coral-symbionts. psii herbicides were significantly positively correlated with remotely sensed coloured dissolved organic matter, a proxy for freshwater extent. combining these methods provides for the first time the potential to cost-effectively monitor improvements in water quality entering the gbr with respect to exposure to psii herbicides.
time regained: when people stop a physical activity program, how does their time use change? a randomised controlled trial measurement in behavioural epidemiology depends on high resolution and precise and accurate measures of the behaviour of interest. few questionnaires in the adult population are able to simultaneously collect the multidimensional information that is emerging as being important in the relationship between behaviour and health. this project had two objectives: (1) to develop an adult version of the computer-delivered multimedia activity recall for children and adolescents (marca), a 24-h activity recall instrument that can measure use-of-time and estimate energy expenditure and (2) to determine the test-retest reliability and convergent validity of the developed adult marca. thirty-eight healthy subjects (mean±sd, 31.7±12.1 yr) completed two recalls of the adult marca within 24-h and accelerometer counts were measured on 30 of the subjects. bland-altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients (icc) were used to quantify the test-retest reliability of the adult marca. spearman rank correlation coefficients (rho) were used to quantify convergent validity of the adult marca compared to accelerometer counts. the test-retest reliability coefficients of the adult marca were high with intra-class coefficients ranging from 0.99 to 1.00. moderate to strong validity was observed for physical activity level (pal) (met.min score of accelerometer wear time) and accelerometer counts per minute (rho=0.72). the adult marca is a valid and reliable self-report measure of use-of-time and energy expenditure, capable of a wide variety of flexible use-of-time analyses related to a wide range of behaviours.
what factors are associated with adolescents' school break time physical activity and sedentary time? abstract objective: to develop an internationally acceptable definition of child overweight and obesity, specifying the measurement, the reference population, and the age and sex specific cut off points. design: international survey of six large nationally representative cross sectional growth studies. setting: brazil, great britain, hong kong, the netherlands, singapore, and the united states subjects: 97 876 males and 94 851 females from birth to 25 years of age main outcome measure: body mass index (weight/height2). results: for each of the surveys, centile curves were drawn that at age 18 years passed through the widely used cut off points of 25 and 30 kg/m2 for adult overweight and obesity. the resulting curves were averaged to provide age and sex specific cut off points from 2-18 years. conclusions: the proposed cut off points, which are less arbitrary and more internationally based than current alternatives, should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in children.
suppression of arbuscule degeneration in medicago truncatula phosphate transporter4 mutants is dependent on the ammonium transporter 2 family protein amt2;3 arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) symbiosis is a widespread mutualism formed between vascular plants and fungi of the glomeromycota. in this endosymbiosis, fungal hyphae enter the roots, growing through epidermal cells to the cortex where they establish differentiated hyphae called arbuscules in the cortical cells. reprogramming of the plant epidermal and cortical cells occurs to enable intracellular growth of the fungal symbiont; however, the plant genes underlying this process are largely unknown. here, through the use of rnai, we demonstrate that the expression of a medicago truncatula gene named vapyrin is essential for arbuscule formation, and also for efficient epidermal penetration by am fungi. vapyrin is induced transiently in the epidermis coincident with hyphal penetration, and then in the cortex during arbuscule formation. the vapyrin protein is cytoplasmic, and in cells containing am fungal hyphae, the protein accumulates in small puncta that move through the cytoplasm. vapyrin is a novel protein composed of two domains that mediate protein-protein interactions: an n-terminal vamp-associated protein (vap)/major sperm protein (msp) domain and a c-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain. putative vapyrin orthologs exist widely in the plant kingdom, but not in arabidopsis, or in non-plant species. the data suggest a role for vapyrin in cellular remodeling to support the intracellular development of fungal hyphae during am symbiosis.
physics of the nucleon sea quark distributions r � strange matrix elements of the nucleon are calculated within the light-cone formulation of the meson cloud model. the q{sup 2} dependence of the strange vector and axial vector form factors is computed, and the strangeness radius and magnetic moment extracted, both of which are found to be very small and slightly negative. within the same framework one finds a small but nonzero excess of the antistrange distribution over the strange at large x. kaon loops are unlikely, however, to be the source of a large polarized strange quark distribution. {copyright} {ital 1997} {ital the american physical society}
using inverse planning for personalized feedback watching another person take actions to complete a goal and making inferences about that person's knowledge is a relatively natural task for people. this ability can be especially important in educational settings, where the inferences can be used for assessment, diagnosing misconceptions, and providing informative feedback. in this paper, we develop a general framework for automatically making such inferences based on observed actions; this framework is particularly relevant for inferring student knowledge in educational games and other interactive virtual environments. our approach relies on modeling action planning: we formalize the problem as a markov decision process in which one must choose what actions to take to complete a goal, where choices will be dependent on one's beliefs about how actions affect the environment. we use a variation of inverse reinforcement learning to infer these beliefs. through two lab experiments, we show that this model can recover people's beliefs in a simple environment, with accuracy comparable to that of human observers. we then demonstrate that the model can be used to provide real-time feedback and to model data from an existing educational game.
emotional intelligence: an integrative meta-analysis and cascading model. a common research problem is the estimation of the population correlation between x and y from an observed correlation rxy obtained from a sample that has been restricted because of some sample selection process. methods of correcting sample correlations for range restriction in a limited set of conditions are well-known. an expanded classification scheme for range-restriction scenarios is developed that conceptualizes range-restriction scenarios from various combinations of the following facets: (a) the variable(s) on which selection occurs (x, y and/or a 3rd variable z), (b) whether unrestricted variances for the relevant variables are known, and (c) whether a 3rd variable, if involved, is measured or unmeasured. on the basis of these facets, the authors describe potential solutions for 11 different range-restriction scenarios and summarize research to date on these techniques.
exact2: the semantics of biomedical protocols motivation: many published manuscripts contain experiment protocols which are poorly described or deficient in information. this means that the published results are very hard or impossible to repeat. this problem is being made worse by the increasing complexity of high-throughput/automated methods. there is therefore a growing need to represent experiment protocols in an efficient and unambiguous way. results: we have developed the experiment actions (exact) ontology as the basis of a method of representing biological laboratory protocols. we provide example protocols that have been formalized using exact, and demonstrate the advantages and opportunities created by using this formalization. we argue that the use of exact will result in the publication of protocols with increased clarity and usefulness to the scientific community. availability: the ontology, examples and code can be downloaded from http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/research/bio/dss/exact/ contact: larisa soldatova lss@aber.ac.uk
nv-dedup: high-performance inline deduplication for non-volatile memory next-generation non-volatile memories (nvms) promise dram-like performance, persistence, and high density. they can attach directly to processors to form non-volatile main memory (nvmm) and offer the opportunity to build very low-latency storage systems. these high-performance storage systems would be especially useful in large-scale data center environments where reliability and availability are critical. however, providing reliability and availability to nvmm is challenging, since the latency of data replication can overwhelm the low latency that nvmm should provide. we propose mojim, a system that provides the reliability and availability that large-scale storage systems require, while preserving the performance of nvmm. mojim achieves these goals by using a two-tier architecture in which the primary tier contains a mirrored pair of nodes and the secondary tier contains one or more secondary backup nodes with weakly consistent copies of data. mojim uses highly-optimized replication protocols, software, and networking stacks to minimize replication costs and expose as much of nvmm?s performance as possible. we evaluate mojim using raw dram as a proxy for nvmm and using an industrial nvmm emulation system. we find that mojim provides replicated nvmm with similar or even better performance than un-replicated nvmm (reducing latency by 27% to 63% and delivering between 0.4 to 2.7x the throughput). we demonstrate that replacing mongodb's built-in replication system with mojim improves mongodb's performance by 3.4 to 4x.
dna prime protein boost strategies protect cattle from bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 challenge. the immunogenicity of a poylvalent hiv-1 vaccine comprised of env antigens from primary r5 isolates was evaluated in rhesus macaques. dna vaccines encoding four env antigens from multiple hiv-1 subtypes and hiv-1 gag antigen from a single subtype elicited a persistent level of binding antibodies to gp120 from multiple hiv-1 isolates that were markedly enhanced following boosting with homologous gp120 proteins in qs-21 adjuvant irrespective of the route of dna immunization. these sera neutralized homologous and, to a lesser degree, heterologous hiv-1 isolates. four of the six immunized animals were completely protected following rectal challenge with a shiv encoding env from hiv-1(ba-l), whereas the virus load was reduced in the remaining animals compared to naïve controls. hence priming with dna encoding env antigens from multiple hiv-1 clades followed by boosting with homologous env proteins elicits anti-hiv-1 immune responses capable of protecting macaques against mucosal transmission of r5 tropic shiv isolate.
comparison of gene expression signatures of diamide, h2o2 and menadione exposed aspergillus nidulans cultures – linking genome-wide transcriptional changes to cellular physiology this report describes a new method for simultaneous isolation of rna, dna and proteins from cell and tissue samples. the method is based on the use of a reagent containing phenol and guanidine thiocyanate. a biological sample is homogenized in the reagent and the simultaneous isolation of rna, dna and proteins is accomplished in a single step by a liquid-phase separation. the isolation of rna can be completed in about 1 h, and dna and proteins in about 3 h. the simultaneously isolated rna, dna and proteins are ready for northern, southern and western blotting. the complete recovery of dna from samples used for the rna and protein isolation makes it possible to normalize the results of gene expression studies based on dna content instead of on the more variable total rna, protein content or tissue weight.
saccharomyces boulardii improves intestinal epithelial cell restitution by inhibiting αvβ5 integrin activation state crosstalk between integrins is involved in the regulation of various cell functions including cell migration. here we identify the interplay between the integrins alphavbeta5/beta6 and alpha2beta1 during cell migration toward type i collagen. human colon cancer cell lines ht29-d4 and sw480 were used as cell models. to improve our understanding of the consequences of alphavbeta5/beta6 function on alpha2beta1, we decreased the expression of alphav integrins by either sirna or lysosomal targeting strategies or inhibited their function using, as antagonists, blocking antibodies or disintegrins. in all cases, we observed a greatly enhanced alpha2beta1 integrin-dependent cell migration associated with focal adhesion rearrangements and increased outside-in signaling as demonstrated by elevated phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and mapkinase (erk1 and erk2). the alphavbeta5/beta6-dependent limitation of alpha2beta1 function could be overridden by ts2/16, an activating anti-beta1 antibody. interestingly, compared to control cells, the pharmacological inhibition of pi3kinase or the sirna-mediated knockdown of akt had little effect on the high alpha2beta1-mediated cell migration observed in the absence of alphav integrins or following activation of alpha2beta1 integrins by the ts2/16. these results suggest that integrins alphavbeta5/beta6 repress alpha2beta1 possibly by interfering with their activation process and thereby modify the cell signaling regulation of alpha2beta1-mediated migration.
leishmaniavirus-dependent metastatic leishmaniasis is prevented by blocking il-17a rna interference (rnai) pathways are widespread in metaozoans but the genes required show variable occurrence or activity in eukaryotic microbes, including many pathogens. while some leishmania lack rnai activity and argonaute or dicer genes, we show that leishmania braziliensis and other species within the leishmania subgenus viannia elaborate active rnai machinery. strong attenuation of expression from a variety of reporter and endogenous genes was seen. as expected, rnai knockdowns of the sole argonaute gene implicated this protein in rnai. the potential for functional genetics was established by testing rnai knockdown lines lacking the paraflagellar rod, a key component of the parasite flagellum. this sets the stage for the systematic manipulation of gene expression through rnai in these predominantly diploid asexual organisms, and may also allow selective rnai-based chemotherapy. functional evolutionary surveys of rnai genes established that rnai activity was lost after the separation of the leishmania subgenus viannia from the remaining leishmania species, a divergence associated with profound changes in the parasite infectious cycle and virulence. the genus leishmania therefore offers an accessible system for testing hypothesis about forces that may select for the loss of rnai during evolution, such as invasion by viruses, changes in genome plasticity mediated by transposable elements and gene amplification (including those mediating drug resistance), and/or alterations in parasite virulence.
a novel strategy to produce sweeter tomato fruits with high sugar contents by fruit-specific expression of a single bzip transcription factor gene. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has revolutionised the rapid analysis of mammalian genomic dna (1). however, pcr is less useful in the analysis of plant dna due to the difficulties in extracting nucleic acids from limited amounts of plant tissue. we have developed a method for the rapid extraction of small amounts of plant genomic dna suitable for pcr analysis. the method is applicable to a variety of plant species and has the added advantage of not requiring any phenol or chloroform extraction. thus it is possible to complete an extraction within 15 minutes without handling any hazardous organic solvents. samples for pcr analysis (usually leaf tissue) are collected using the lid of a sterile eppendorf tube to pinch out a disc of material into the tube. this ensures uniform sample size and also reduces the possibilities of contamination arising from handling the tissue. dna is extracted as follows: the tissue is macerated (using disposable grinders from bel-art products: scienceware, pequannock, nj, 07440 usa. catalog no 992) in the original eppendorf tube at room temperature, without buffer, for 15 seconds. 400 yl of extraction buffer (200 mm tris hc1 ph 7.5, 250 mm nacl, 25 mm edta, 0.5% sds) is added and the sample vortexed for 5 seconds. this mixture can then be left at room temperature until all the samples have been extracted (> 1 hour). the extracts are centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and 300 y\ of the supernatant transferred to a fresh eppendorf tube. this supernatant is mixed with 300 /il isopropanol and left at room temperature for 2 minutes. following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the pellet is vacuum dried and dissolved in 100 /xl 1xte. this dna is stable at 4°c for greater than one year. 2.5 yx of this sample is sufficient for a standard 50 y\ pcr (figure 1). when older tissue is used this may be increased to 25 /xl without any deleterious effect on the pcr. using this protocol we have found it possible to process hundreds of individual samples in a single working day.
clinical assessment of effusion in knee osteoarthritis—a systematic review objectives: to assess the prevalence of inflammation in subjects with chronic painful knee osteoarthritis (oa), as determined by the presence of synovitis or joint effusion at ultrasonography (us); and to evaluate the correlation between synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters. methods: a cross sectional, multicentre, european study was conducted under the umbrella of eular-escisit. subjects had primary chronic knee oa (acr criteria) with pain during physical activity ⩾30 mm for at least 48 hours. clinical parameters were collected by a rheumatologist and an us examination of the painful knee was performed by a radiologist or rheumatologist within 72 hours of the clinical examination. ultrasonographic synovitis was defined as synovial thickness ⩾4 mm and diffuse or nodular appearance, and a joint effusion was defined as effusion depth ⩾4 mm. results: 600 patients with painful knee oa were analysed. at us 16 (2.7%) had synovitis alone, 85 (14.2%) had both synovitis and effusion, 177 (29.5%) had joint effusion alone, and 322 (53.7%) had no inflammation according to the definitions employed. multivariate analysis showed that inflammation seen by us correlated statistically with advanced radiographic disease (kellgren-lawrence grade ⩾3; odds ratio (or) = 2.20 and 1.91 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively), and with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of an inflammatory “flare”, such as joint effusion on clinical examination (or = 1.97 and 2.70 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively) or sudden aggravation of knee pain (or = 1.77 for joint effusion). conclusion: us can detect synovial inflammation and effusion in painful knee oa, which correlate significantly with knee synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters suggestive of an inflammatory “flare”.
distributed differential privacy and applications we propose a general purpose runtime framework to secure timing channels. our technique supports higher-order function invocations and computations looping on secret data, features which none of the existing approaches fully allow. we provably eliminate external and internal timing channels in both sequential and concurrent settings, in presence of deterministic as well as nondeterministic schedulers. there is a price to be paid, however – the high computation may have to be disrupted; the low computation is nevertheless guaranteed to be unaffected. we illustrate how our approach can be realized on standard computing platforms.
the impact of resistance training on swimming performance: a systematic review abstract dragunas, aj, dickey, jp, and nolte, vw. the effect of drag suit training on 50 m freestyle performance. j strength cond res 26(4): 989–994, 2012—little research has evaluated the effects of drag suit training in swimming; these effects need to be explored further to optimize their use in training. for this 5-week training study, 18 subjects were divided evenly into 2 groups: control group and drag suit–trained group. both groups performed weekly training routines that included 3 sprint sets. these sprint sets were performed by both the groups; however, the drag suit training group wore the drag suit, and the control group wore their typical training attire. we evaluated the swimmers' 50-m performance using a test set of six 50-m sprints on a 10-minute interval before and after the training program. the test set was performed twice (on 2 different days) where the swimmers were tested once in the drag suit and once in their regular training attire; the order of testing was randomized. final time, stroke rate, and distance per stroke were collected. we observed that the drag suit–trained group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in distance per stoke while wearing the drag suit and the control group showed a significant increase in stroke rate and decrease in distance per stroke (in both suits). it is suggested to include some amounts of drag suit training in periods where swimming volume may decrease. sets that are short in distance and performed at high intensity with sufficient rest to allow swimmers to maintain high stroke integrity should help athletes maintain techniques. we suggest incorporating the drag suit into the training regimen and should be considered a valuable resistive training device for swimming.
pparδ agonists have opposing effects on insulin resistance in high fat‐fed rats and mice due to different metabolic responses in muscle in this study, we defined the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (ppardelta) in metabolic homeostasis by using subtype selective agonists. analysis of rat l6 myotubes treated with the ppardelta subtype-selective agonist, gw501516, by the affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays revealed that ppardelta controls fatty acid oxidation by regulating genes involved in fatty acid transport, beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial respiration. similar ppardelta-mediated gene activation was observed in the skeletal muscle of gw501516-treated mice. accordingly, gw501516 treatment induced fatty acid beta-oxidation in l6 myotubes as well as in mouse skeletal muscles. administration of gw501516 to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, an effect accompanied by enhanced metabolic rate and fatty acid beta-oxidation, proliferation of mitochondria, and a marked reduction of lipid droplets in skeletal muscles. despite a modest body weight change relative to vehicle-treated mice, gw501516 treatment also markedly improved diabetes as revealed by the decrease in plasma glucose and blood insulin levels in genetically obese ob/ob mice. these data suggest that ppardelta is pivotal to control the program for fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle, thereby ameliorating obesity and insulin resistance through its activation in obese animals.
multiple new site-specific recombinases for use in manipulating animal genomes a new member of the 2-micron family of plasmids, named ptd1, was found in the yeast torulaspora delbrueckii, a widespread yeast associated with food. nucleotide sequences revealed the presence of a pair of inverted repeats and three open reading frames, one of which is a homologue of the flp recombinase gene of 2-micron plasmid. an ars region was identified, by replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae and t. delbrueckii, near one of the inverted repeats. by the use of ptd1 derivatives and auxotrophic mutant hosts an efficient host-vector system was established for t. delbrueckii. so far, the 2-micron family of plasmids is restricted to four closely related genera (q6 group): saccharomyces, zygosaccharomyces, kluyveromyces, and torulaspora. after a survey of 2500 strains belonging to about 500 species (80 genera) of yeast, no circular plasmids were found in other genera.
molecular epidemiology of group b streptococcal meningitis in children beyond the neonatal period from angola. transmission of group b streptococcus (gbs) from mothers to neonates during childbirth is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. although subtyping tools have identified specific gbs phylogenetic lineages that are important in neonatal disease, little is known about the genetic diversity of these lineages or the roles that recombination and selection play in the generation of emergent genotypes. here, we examined genetic variation, selection, and recombination in seven multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci from 94 invasive, colonizing, and bovine strains representing 38 gbs sequence types and performed dna sequencing and pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of several putative virulence genes to identify gene content differences between genotypes. despite the low level of diversity in the mlst loci, a neighbor net analysis revealed a variable range of genetic exchange among the seven clonal complexes (ccs) identified, suggesting that recombination is partly responsible for the diversity observed between genotypes. recombination is also important for several virulence genes, as some gene alleles had evidence for lateral gene exchange across divergent genotypes. the cc-17 lineage, which is associated with neonatal disease, is relatively homogeneous and therefore appears to have diverged independently with an exclusive set of virulence characteristics. these data suggest that different gbs genetic backgrounds have distinct virulence gene profiles that may be important for disease pathogenesis. such profiles could be used as markers for the rapid detection of strains with an increased propensity to cause neonatal disease and may be considered useful vaccine targets.
structure learning in random fields for heart motion abnormality detection coronary heart disease can be diagnosed by measuring and scoring regional motion of the heart wall in ultrasound images of the left ventricle (lv) of the heart. we describe a completely automated and robust technique that detects diseased hearts based on detection and automatic tracking of the endocardium and epicardium of the lv. the local wall regions and the entire heart are then classified as normal or abnormal based on the regional and global lv wall motion. in order to leverage structural information about the heart we applied bayesian networks to this problem, and learned the relations among the wall regions off of the data using a structure learning algorithm. we checked the validity of the obtained structure using anatomical knowledge of the heart and medical rules as described by doctors. the resultant bayesian network classifier depends only on a small subset of numerical features extracted from dual-contours tracked through time and selected using a filter-based approach. our numerical results confirm that our system is robust and accurate on echocardiograms collected in routine clinical practice at one hospital; our system is built to be used in real-time.
identification of enriched driver gene alterations in subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer patients based on histology and smoking status to investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular features of the t790m mutation and c-met amplification in a cohort of chinese non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis). egfr tki-resistant nsclc patients (n = 29) and corresponding tumor specimens, and 53 samples of postoperative tki-naïve nsclc patients were collected. egfr exon 19, 20, and 21 mutations were analyzed. and c-met gene copy number was determined. the egfr t790m mutation in exon 20 was not detected in the population of 53 tki-naïve patients, but found in 48.3% (14/29) of the enrolled tki-resistant patients. c-met was amplified in 3.8% (2/53) of the tki-naïve nsclc patients and highly amplified in 17.2% (5/29) of the cohort. most of t790m mutations were frequently associated with non-smoker, adenocarcinoma and egfr activating mutations. three male patients with t790m mutation occurred with wild-type egfr, and were resistant to the treatments following tki resistance. features of c-met amplification in tki-naïve patients were indistinguishable from tki-resistant patients. in the group of wild-type egfr, patients with t790m mutation had median progression free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) as 9.6 months and 12.6 months, respectively; whereas the median pfs and os of c-met amplified patients was 4.1 months and 8.0 months, respectively. these results suggest that egfr t790m mutation and c-met amplification can occur in tki-resistant nsclc with wild-type egfr, and these genetic defects might be related to different survival outcome. c-met amplification in tki-naïve or -resistant patients might share similarities in clinicopathologic features.
high-frequency electrical stimulation of the human skin induces heterotopical mechanical hyperalgesia, heat hyperalgesia, and enhanced responses to nonnociceptive vibrotactile input. knowing whether an individual prefers the left or right hand for skilled activities is important to researchers in experimental psychology and neuroscience. the current study reports on a new measure of skilled hand preference derived from the provins and cunliffe (1972) handedness inventory. undergraduates (n = 3324) indicated their lateral preference for their hands, feet, eyes and ears. a measure of hand performance and familial handedness was also obtained. factor analysis identified ten items that loaded on skilled hand preference and these were included in the new flanders questionnaire. cluster analysis of the new questionnaire revealed three distinct groups (left-, mixed- & right-handed). the new test showed a strong association with other measures of lateral preference and hand performance. scores on the test were also related to the sex of the respondent and the hand preference of their parents. the flanders provides a measure of skilled hand preference that is easy to administer and understand and should be useful for experimenters wanting to screen for hand preference.
cell-level temperature distributions in skeletal muscle post spinal cord injury as related to deep tissue injury resistance to blood flow through peripheral vascular beds strongly influences cardiovascular function and transport to tissue. for a given vascular architecture, flow resistance is determined by the rheological behavior of blood flowing through microvessels. a new approach for calculating the contribution of blood rheology to microvascular flow resistance is presented. morphology (diameter and length), flow velocity, hematocrit, and topological position were determined for all vessel segments (up to 913) of terminal microcirculatory networks in the rat mesentery by intravital microscopy. flow velocity and hematocrit were also predicted from mathematical flow simulations, in which the assumed dependence of flow resistance on diameter, hematocrit, and shear rate was optimized to minimize the deviation between measured and predicted values. for microvessels with diameters below approximately 40 microns, the resulting flow resistances are markedly higher and show a stronger dependence on hematocrit than previously estimated from measurements of blood flow in narrow glass tubes. for example, flow resistance in 10-microns microvessels at normal hematocrit is found to exceed that of a corresponding glass tube by a factor of approximately 4. in separate experiments, flow resistance of microvascular networks was estimated from direct measurements of total pressure drop and volume flow, at systemic hematocrits intentionally varied from 0.08 to 0.68. the results agree closely with predictions based on the above-optimized resistance but not with predictions based on glass-tube data. the unexpectedly high flow resistance in small microvessels may be related to interactions between blood components and the inner vessel surface that do not occur in smooth-walled tubes.
interactions of exercise training and alpha-lipoic acid on insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of obese zucker rats. voluntary wheel running (wr) by juvenile female rats was used as a noninterventional model of soleus muscle functional overload to study the regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity by the glucose transporter (glut-4 isoform) protein level and glycogen concentration. soleus total protein content was significantly greater (+18%; p < 0.05) than in age-matched controls after 1 wk of wr, and this hypertrophic response continued in weeks 2-4 (+24-32%). glut-4 protein was 39% greater than in controls in 1-wk wr soleus, and this adaptation was accompanied by a similar increase in in vitro insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity (+29%). after 2 and 4 wk of wr, however, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity had returned to control levels, despite a continued elevation (+25-28%) of glut-4 protein. at these two time points, glycogen concentration was significantly enhanced in wr soleus (+21-42%), which coincided with significant reductions in glycogen synthase activity ratios (-23 to -41%). these results indicate that, in this model of soleus muscle functional overload, the glut-4 protein level may initially regulate insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in the absence of changes in other modifying factors. however, this regulation of glucose transport activity by glut-4 protein may be subsequently overridden by elevated glycogen concentration.
functional roles played by the sympathetic supply to lip blood vessels in the cat. 1 the present study was designed to examine the interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on blood flow in oro‐facial areas such as lower lip, palate and submandibular gland (smg) and in the common carotid artery (cca) in anaesthetized cats. 2 section of the ipsilateral superior cervical sympathetic trunk (cst) increased the basal cca blood flow significantly. the control level with the nerve intact was comparable with that seen at 0.5‐1 hz cst stimulation, suggesting a spontaneous discharge of around 0.5‐1 hz in the cst fibres innervating the beds supplied by the cca. the basal blood flow at all sites examined was reduced by cst stimulation in a frequency‐dependent manner. 3 electrical stimulation of the central end of the lingual nerve (ln) evoked blood flow increases in the lower lip and palate. these blood flow increases were markedly reduced by concurrent cst stimulation in a manner that was frequency dependent, but not simply related to the vasoconstrictor effect of cst stimulation. this effect of cst stimulation was not observed in tongue or smg, even though cst stimulation evoked vasoconstriction in these tissues. a significant reduction in the level of cca blood flow attained during ln stimulation was observed on repetitive cst stimulation only at 10 hz, indicating that this response behaved in a fashion different from that seen in the lower lip, palate, tongue and smg. 4 the present study suggests that concurrent repetitive cst stimulation reduces parasympathetically mediated blood flow increases in certain oro‐facial areas (such as the lower lip and palate), but not in the tongue and smg. this inhibitory action was not a simple additive effect (between vasoconstriction and vasodilatation) and it disappeared rapidly after the cessation of cst stimulation.
characterization of the antidiabetic role of parkinsonia aculeata (caesalpineaceae) hypoglycemic effect of gentiana olivieri griseb. (gentianaceae) flowering herbs on oral administration were studied using in vivo models in normal, glucose-hyperglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. through in vivo bioassay-guided fractionation processes isoorientin, a known c-glycosylflavone, was isolated from the ethylacetate fraction by silica gel column chromatography as the main active ingredient from the plant. isoorientin exhibited significant hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects at 15 mg/kg b.w.dose. isoorientin concentration of the extracts and fractions were determined by hplc in order to establish a correlation between the hypoglycaemic activity.
influence of the virus lbfv and of wolbachia in a host-parasitoid interaction wolbachia are a group of intracellular inherited bacteria that infect a wide range of arthropods. they are associated with a number of different reproductive phenotypes in their hosts, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis and feminization. while it is known that the bacterial strains responsible for these different host phenotypes form a single clade within the α–proteobacteria, until now it has not been possible to resolve the evolutionary relationships between differentwolbachia strains. to address this issue we have cloned and sequenced a gene encoding a surface protein ofwolbachia (wsp) from a representative sample of 28wolbachia strains. the sequences from this gene were highly variable and could be used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of differentwolbachia strains. based on the sequence of thewsp gene from differentwolbachia isolates we propose that thewolbachia pipientis clade be initially divided into 12 groups. as more sequence information becomes available we expect the number of such groups to increase. in addition, we present a method ofwolbachia classification based on the use of group–specificwsp pcr primers which will allowwolbachia isolates to be typed without the need to clone and sequence individualwolbachia genes. this system should facilitate future studies investigating the distribution and biology ofwolbachia strains from large samples of different host species.
endogenous gip ameliorates impairment of insulin secretion in proglucagon-deficient mice under moderate beta cell damage induced by streptozotocin aims/introduction:  excessive intake of sucrose can cause severe health issues, such as diabetes mellitus. in animal studies, consumption of a high‐sucrose diet (suc) has been shown to cause obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. however, several in vivo experiments have been carried out using diets with much higher sucrose contents (50–70% of the total calories) than are typically ingested by humans. in the present study, we examined the effects of a moderate suc on glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanism.
activity of primate orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal neurons: task-related activity during an oculomotor delayed-response task 1. single-neuron activity was recorded from the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing saccadic eye movements in oculomotor delayed-response (odr) and visually guided saccade (vgs) tasks. in the odr task the monkey was required to maintain fixation of a central spot throughout the 0.5-s cue and 3.0-s delay before making a saccadic eye movement in the dark to one of four or eight locations where the visual cue had been presented. the same locations were used for targets in the vgs tasks; however, unlike the odr task, saccades in the vgs tasks were visually guided. 2. among 434 neurons recorded from prefrontal cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus (ps), 147 changed their discharge rates in relation to saccadic eye movements in the odr task. their response latencies relative to saccade initiation were distributed between -192 and 460-ms, with 22% exhibiting presaccadic activity and 78% exhibiting only postsaccadic activity. among ps neurons with presaccadic activity, 53% also had postsaccadic activity when the monkey made saccadic eye movements opposite to the directions for which the presaccadic activity was observed. 3. almost all (97%) ps neurons with presaccadic activity were directionally selective. the best direction and tuning specificity of each neuron were estimated from parameters used to fit a gaussian tuning curve function. the best direction for 62% of the neurons with presaccadic activity was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (23%) or along the vertical meridian (15%). 4. most postsaccadic activity of ps neurons (92%) was also directionally selective. the best direction for 48% of these neurons was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (36%) or along the vertical meridian (16%). eighteen percent of the neurons with postsaccadic activity showed a reciprocal response pattern: excitatory responses occurred for one set of saccade directions, whereas inhibitory responses occurred for roughly the opposite set of directions. 5. sixty ps neurons with saccade-related activity in the odr task were also examined in a vgs task. forty of these neurons showed highly similar profiles of directional specificity and response magnitude in both tasks, 13 showed saccade-related activity only in the odr task, and 7 changed their response characteristics between the odr and vgs tasks.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
time-lapse imaging of the dynamics of cns glial-axonal interactions in vitro and ex vivo abstract: the gene expression of myelin basic proteins (mbps) in shiverer mutant mice was investigated by the northern and southern hybridization techniques. in the control mice rna molecules from the brains which were about 2,300 nucleotides in length were hybridized to cdna of 1.8 kb encoding for a mouse mbp, but rna from the brains of 3‐week‐old shiverer mutant mice contained no detectable amount of mbp transcripts hybridizing to this probe. moreover the shiverer mutant mice lost several restriction fragments that hybridized to the same probe in the control mice when each of the five restriction enzymes, i.e., hindiii, psti, pvuii, acci, and stui, was used. these data suggest that the shiverer mutation may correspond to the deletion of a large portion of mbp exon(s) in the gene, and this deletion causes inefficient transcription leading to the depletion of mbps in the myelin and the dysmyelination observed in these mice.

compliance with noninvasive home ventilation in children with obstructive sleep apnoea. positive airway pressure (pap) devices are used to treat patients with sleep related breathing disorders (srbds), including obstructive sleep apnea (osa). after a patient is diagnosed with osa, the current standard of practice involves performing attended polysomnography (psg), during which positive airway pressure is adjusted throughout the recording period to determine the optimal pressure for maintaining upper airway patency. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) and bilevel positive airway pressure (bpap) represent the two forms of pap that are manually titrated during psg to determine the single fixed pressure of cpap or the fixed inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (ipap and epap, respectively) of bpap for subsequent nightly usage. a pap titration task force of the american academy of sleep medicine reviewed the available literature. based on this review, the task force developed these recommendations for conducting cpap and bpap titrations. major recommendations are as follows: (1) all potential pap titration candidates should receive adequate pap education, hands-on demonstration, careful mask fitting, and acclimatization prior to titration. (2) cpap (ipap and/or epap for patients on bpap) should be increased until the following obstructive respiratory events are eliminated (no specific order) or the recommended maximum cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) is reached: apneas, hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals (reras), and snoring. (3) the recommended minimum starting cpap should be 4 cm h2o for pediatric and adult patients, and the recommended minimum starting ipap and epap should be 8 cm h2o and 4 cm h2o, respectively, for pediatric and adult patients on bpap. (4) the recommended maximum cpap should be 15 cm h2o (or recommended maximum ipap of 20 cm h2o if on bpap) for patients < 12 years, and 20 cm h2o (or recommended maximum ipap of 30 cm h2o if on bpap) for patients > or = 12 years. (5) the recommended minimum ipap-epap differential is 4 cm h2o and the recommended maximum ipap-epap differential is 10 cm h2o (6) cpap (ipap and/or epap for patients on bpap depending on the type of event) should be increased by at least 1 cm h2o with an interval no shorter than 5 min, with the goal of eliminating obstructive respiratory events. (7) cpap (ipap and epap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 obstructive apnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 2 obstructive apneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (8) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 hypopnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 hypopneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (9) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 3 reras are observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 5 reras are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (10) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) may be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 min of loud or unambiguous snoring is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 min of loud or unambiguous snoring are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (11) the titration algorithm for split-night cpap or bpap titration studies should be identical to that of full-night cpap or bpap titration studies, respectively. (12) if the patient is uncomfortable or intolerant of high pressures on cpap, the patient may be tried on bpap. if there are continued obstructive respiratory events at 15 cm h2o of cpap during the titration study, the patient may be switched to bpap. (13) the pressure of cpap or bpap selected for patient use following the titration study should reflect control of the patient's obstructive respiration by a low (preferably < 5 per hour) respiratory disturbance index (rdi) at the selected pressure, a minimum sea level spo2 above 90% at the pressure, and with a leak within acceptable parameters at the pressure.) (14) an optimal titration reduces rdi < 5 for at least a 15-min duration and should include supine rem sleep at the selected pressure that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings. (15) a good titration reduces rdi < or = 10 or by 50% if the baseline rdi < 15 and should include supine rem sleep that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings at the selected pressure. (16) an adequate titration does not reduce the rdi < or = 10 but reduces the rdi by 75% from baseline (especially in severe osa patients), or one in which the titration grading criteria for optimal or good are met with the exception that supine rem sleep did not occur at the selected pressure. (17) an unacceptable titration is one that does not meet any one of the above grades. (18) a repeat pap titration study should be considered if the initial titration does not achieve a grade of optimal or good and, if it is a split-night psg study, it fails to meet aasm criteria (i.e., titration duration should be > 3 hr).
learning dilation factors for semantic segmentation of street scenes convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. we show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. we define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. we adapt contemporary classification networks (alexnet, the vgg net, and googlenet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. we then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of pascal voc (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean iu on 2012), nyudv2, sift flow, and pascal-context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.
virtual electrophysiological study of atrial fibrillation in fibrotic remodeling personalized computational cardiac models are emerging as an important tool for studying cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, and have the potential to become powerful instruments for guiding clinical anti-arrhythmia therapy. in this article, we present the methodology for constructing a patient-specific model of atrial fibrosis as a substrate for atrial fibrillation. the model is constructed from high-resolution late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (lge-mri) images acquired in vivo from a patient suffering from persistent atrial fibrillation, accurately capturing both the patient's atrial geometry and the distribution of the fibrotic regions in the atria. atrial fiber orientation is estimated using a novel image-based method, and fibrosis is represented in the patient-specific fibrotic regions as incorporating collagenous septa, gap junction remodeling, and myofibroblast proliferation. a proof-of-concept simulation result of reentrant circuits underlying atrial fibrillation in the model of the patient's fibrotic atrium is presented to demonstrate the completion of methodology development.
hydrogen isotope fractionation during water uptake by woody xerophytes summarycrops sprinkled with saline irrigation water are subject to foliar salt absorption and injury as well as to injury from soil salinity. yield reductions caused by soil salinity alone are well documented, and data are presented here for 71 agricultural crops. factors affecting these data and their applicability to sprinkler-irrigated crops are discussed. although foliar injury has been observed with many sprinkled crops, particularly tree crops, essentially no information is available to predict yield losses as a function of the salt concentration of the irrigation water. salinity thresholds for sprinkling-induced foliar injury are estimated for some crops; however, climatic conditions greatly affect the onset and degree of injury. managment strategies that minimize sprinkling injury are mentioned.
selected genetic polymorphisms and plasma coagulation factor vii changes with exercise training. objective to cross-sectionally evaluate the presence of clustering of the insulin-resistance syndrome components. tests were conducted for association of the hind iii restriction site polymorphism at the lipoprotein lipase locus with clustering of the physiological components of the insulin resistance syndrome. research design and methods dna samples of 370 normoglycemic hispanics and 520 normoglycemic non-hispanic whites from the san luis valley, colorado, were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. lipids and glucose were determined by the standard procedures. cross-tabulation and χ2 analysis were used. results the insulin-resistance syndrome components (elevated fasting insulin, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated triglycerides) appeared together in individuals of this population sample more often than expected by chance. individuals in the population with the (+/+) lipoprotein lipase-hindiii restriction of fragment-length polymorphism genotype were more likely to have elevated fasting insulin and triglycerides and a reduced high-density lipoproteincholesterol level than subjects with the (+/−) genotype (odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.38–3.98). conclusions as expected from the physiological function of lipoprotein lipase, the primary association of lipoprotein lipase genotypes is with triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. this appears to be the first reported genetic association with the insulin-resistance syndrome and may reflect genotype specific differences in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase by insulin.
a novel splice site mutation of the ldl receptor gene in a tunisian hypercholesterolemic family. the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor is a cell surface transmembrane protein that mediates the uptake and lysosomal degradation of plasma ldl, thereby providing cholesterol to cells. mutations disrupting the function of this receptor produce autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). affected individuals have elevated plasma levels of ldl, which causes premature coronary atherosclerosis. to date, 71 mutations in the ldl receptor gene have been characterized at a molecular level. in this report, we describe 79 additional mutations and review the insights that all 150 mutations have provided into the structure/function relationship of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of fh. © 1992 wiley‐liss, inc.
ultracentrifugation deforms unfixed influenza a virions. abstract the viral replication cycle concludes with the assembly of viral components to form progeny virions. for influenza a viruses, the matrix m1 protein and two membrane integral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, function cooperatively in this process. here, we asked whether another membrane protein, the m2 protein, plays a role in virus assembly. the m2 protein, comprising 97 amino acids, possesses the longest cytoplasmic tail (54 residues) of the three transmembrane proteins of influenza a viruses. we therefore generated a series of deletion mutants of the m2 cytoplasmic tail by reverse genetics. we found that mutants in which more than 22 amino acids were deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the m2 tail were viable but grew less efficiently than did the wild-type virus. an analysis of the virions suggested that viruses with m2 tail deletions of more than 22 carboxy-terminal residues apparently contained less viral ribonucleoprotein complex than did the wild-type virus. these m2 tail mutants also differ from the wild-type virus in their morphology: while the wild-type virus is spherical, some of the mutants were filamentous. alanine-scanning experiments further indicated that amino acids at positions 74 to 79 of the m2 tail play a role in virion morphogenesis and affect viral infectivity. we conclude that the m2 cytoplasmic domain of influenza a viruses plays an important role in viral assembly and morphogenesis.
direct evidence for embryonic uptake of paternally-derived nutrients in two pipefishes (syngnathidae: syngnathus spp.) summary male seahorses and pipefishes of the family syngnathidae are heralded for their unique brood pouch structures for incubating embryos. there are three general types of brood pouch with increasing complexity: simple ventral gluing, two pouch flaps and a completely sealed sac. the diversity of functional roles within a type in providing nutrition, aeration and protection to offspring is unknown. here we reveal significant differences in parental nutrient allocation to embryos for two closely related, sympatric pipefishes with similar brood pouch structure. we document differences in embryo attachment, depletion of pouch fluid nutrients over development and egg nutrient partitioning between syngnathus floridae and syngnathus fuscus. in s. fuscus, females produce nutritionally poor eggs and the males implant developing embryos in the brood pouch adjacent to blood vessels. a female-biased breeding population was observed, supporting the hypothesis that the cost of male parental care is high in this species. the loose connection between eggs and brood pouch tissues and the appearance of undeveloped eggs and lipid droplets in the pouch of s. floridae males suggest this species utilizes nutrient-rich eggs produced by females as nurse eggs to supplement embryonic development. a balanced sex-ratio for s. floridae further supports more equal parental contribution. this comparison provides evidence of a decline in female gametic investment and reveals the rapid diversification of syngnathid brood pouch function. our results indicate gross classification of brooding structures into one of the three general pouch types does not predict the energetic investment of males in parental care. but rather, physiological characterization of the relative investment by each sex to offspring is essential to understanding the functional significance of the brood pouch.
mir-331-3p regulates expression of neuropilin-2 in glioblastoma micrornas are small noncoding rnas that function by regulating target gene expression posttranscriptionally. they play a critical role in developmental and physiologic processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer. we examined the expression profiles of 241 human micrornas in normal tissues and the nci-60 panel of human tumor-derived cell lines. to quantify microrna expression, we employed a highly sensitive technique that uses stem-loop primers for reverse transcription followed by real-time pcr. most micrornas were expressed at lower levels in tumor-derived cell lines compared with the corresponding normal tissue. agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of microrna expression revealed four groups among the nci-60 cell lines consisting of hematologic, colon, central nervous system, and melanoma tumor-derived cell lines clustered in a manner that reflected their tissue of origin. we identified specific subsets of micrornas that provide candidate molecular signatures characteristic of the tumor-derived cell lines belonging to these four clusters. we also identified specific microrna expression patterns that correlated with the proliferation indices of the nci-60 cell lines, and we developed evidence for the identification of specific micrornas as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in different tumor types. our results provide evidence that microrna expression patterns may mark specific biological characteristics of tumors and/or mediate biological activities important for the pathobiology of malignant tumors. these findings call attention to the potential of micrornas to provide etiologic insights as well as to serve as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for many different tumor types.
active 3d scene segmentation using kinect. this paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. the success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. these goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. we define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. a third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. we use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. on specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. with this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. the optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a gaussian-smoothed image. we extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. we present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.
doppler tissue imaging: a noninvasive technique for evaluation of left ventricular relaxation and estimation of filling pressures. left atrial (la) volume measurements have been made by the application of the method of discs (modified simpson's rule) to orthogonal biplane atrial echocardiographic images. validation of the technique has been suboptimal due to deficiencies of the reference standard, levophase angiography. to define the accuracy of echocardiography, we compared la end-systolic volume by echocardiography in 27 patients with volumes by cine computed tomography (cine ct), a highly accurate and validated method of measuring cardiac chambers. echocardiographic tracings were made in the apical long-axis two- and four-chamber views. in patients with atria less than 300 ml, 14 had echoes performed prospectively, with optimization of la size, while the remaining 10 were analyzed retrospectively. the volume of each slice was calculated and was then summated to obtain total volume. the correlation coefficient between two-dimensional echocardiography and cine ct was r = 0.98, and it was r = 0.82 when patients with atria greater than 300 ml (n = 3) were excluded. echocardiography underestimated cine ct measurements by 23%. the slope of the prospective group was closer to unity than the slope of the retrospective group (p less than 0.001), and the correlation with cine ct was slightly better for the prospective group (r = 0.88 versus r = 0.77). la volume by two-dimensional echocardiography correlates closely with cine ct, a more accurate method of volume determination, and gives valid measurements of la volume. efforts to maximize la size during scanning limit inaccuracies of echocardiographic measurements of the left atrium.
ultrasonographic demonstration of manipulation-related aortic injuries after cardiac surgery. background to further gain insight into atheroembolization mechanisms epiaortic two-dimensional echocardiographic evaluation before extracorporeal circulation and after decannulation may be helpful.   methods epiaortic two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before cannulation and after decannulation in 188 (124 men) patients (mean age, 67.7 years; range, 43 to 86 years) undergoing operation with extracorporeal circulation for ischemic heart disease during 1996.   results after decannulation, a new intimal lesion was recognized in 10 of 188 patients (5.3%): mobile type in 5 patients (3 ending with a stroke [60%], 2 having brain computed tomographic scans compatible with embolism), intimal tear in 2, and intimal irregularity in 3 patients. stroke occurred in a significantly smaller number of patients (2 of 178 [1.1%]; p < 0.001) without new lesions.   conclusions clamp- or cannula-induced new lesions, especially of mobile type, are often complicated by postoperative stroke. aggressive surgical technique modifications may need to be considered to avoid creating new lesions, particularly of the mobile type.
modulating the folding of p-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator truncation mutants with pharmacological chaperones the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (cf) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (deltaf508) in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel. the deltaf508 mutation produces defects in folding, stability, and channel gating. to identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in deltaf508-cftr-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of deltaf508-cftr correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated deltaf508-cftr protein. biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved deltaf508-cftr folding at the er and stability at the cell surface. the bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected deltaf508-cftr in deltaf508/deltaf508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive cftr mutant (p574h-cftr) or a dopamine receptor mutant. small-molecule correctors may be useful in the treatment of cf caused by the deltaf508 mutation.
no evidence for a fundamental visual motion processing deficit in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders the autism diagnostic observation schedule—generic (ados-g) is a semistructured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. the observational schedule consists of four 30-minute modules, each designed to be administered to different individuals according to their level of expressive language. psychometric data are presented for 223 children and adults with autistic disorder (autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pddnos) or nonspectrum diagnoses. within each module, diagnostic groups were equivalent on expressive language level. results indicate substantial interrater and test—retest reliability for individual items, excellent interrater reliability within domains and excellent internal consistency. comparisons of means indicated consistent differentiation of autism and pddnos from nonspectrum individuals, with some, but less consistent, differentiation of autism from pddnos. a priori operationalization of dsm-iv/icd-10 criteria, factor analyses, and roc curves were used to generate diagnostic algorithms with thresholds set for autism and broader autism spectrum/pdd. algorithm sensitivities and specificities for autism and pddnos relative to nonspectrum disorders were excellent, with moderate differentiation of autism from pddnos.
bi-alphabetism: a window on phonological processing reaction times (rts) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of rt data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., forster & dickinson, 1976). mixed-effects modeling (see, e.g., baayen, davidson, & bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. in this study, we argue for empirical exibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the rts. we advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. we also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. these strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. special attention is paid to the evaluation of interactions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.
serine‐o‐sulphate transport by the human glutamate transporter, eaat2 reuptake plays an important role in regulating synaptic and extracellular concentrations of glutamate. three glutamate transporters expressed in human motor cortex, termed eaat1, eaat2, and eaat3 (for excitatory amino acid transporter), have been characterized by their molecular cloning and functional expression. each eaat subtype mrna was found in all human brain regions analyzed. the most prominent regional variation in message content was in cerebellum where eaat1 expression predominated. eaat1 and eaat3 mrnas were also expressed in various non- nervous tissues, whereas expression of eaat2 was largely restricted to brain. the kinetic parameters and pharmacological characteristics of transport mediated by each eaat subtype were determined in transfected mammalian cells by radio-label uptake and in microinjected oocytes by voltage-clamp measurements. the affinities of the eaat subtypes for l- glutamate were similar, with km determinations varying from 48 to 97 microm in the mammalian cell assay and from 18 to 28 microm in oocytes. glutamate uptake inhibitors were used to compare the pharmacologies of the eaat subtypes. the eaat2 subtype was distinguishable from the eaat1/eaat3 subtypes by the potency of several inhibitors, but most notably by sensitivity to kainic acid (ka) and dihydrokainic acid (dhk). ka and dhk potently inhibited eaat2 transport, but did not significantly affect transport by eaat1/eaat3. using voltage-clamp measurements, most inhibitors were found to be substrates that elicited transport currents. in contrast, ka and dhk did not evoke currents and they were found to block eaat2-mediated transport competitively. this selective interaction with the eaat2 subtype could be a significant factor in ka neurotoxicity. these studies provide a foundation for understanding the role of glutamate transporters in human excitatory neurotransmission and in neuropathology.
itep: an integrated toolkit for exploration of microbial pan-genomes a discrete uncoupling process for finite spaces is introduced, called the markov cluster process or the mcl process. the process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the mcl algorithm. the mcl process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. expansion corresponds with taking the $k$th power of a stochastic matrix, where $k\in\n$. inflation corresponds with a parametrized operator $\gamma_r$, $r\geq 0$, that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. the image $\gamma_r m$ is obtained by raising each entry in $m$ to the $r$th power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. in practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. the heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. the process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph $g$, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of $g$. the limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the mcl algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. several mathematical properties of the mcl process are established. most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. the inflation operator $\gamma_r$ maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. the phrase diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. for $r\in\n$ and for $m$ a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image $\gamma_r m$ is again dpsd. determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix $m$ imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of $m$, generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. the spectrum of $\gamma_{\infty} m$ is of the form $\{0^{n-k}, 1^k\}$, where $k$ is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with $m$, and $n$ is the dimension of $m$. this attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.
unsupervised acquisition of comprehensive multiword lexicons using competition in an n-gram lattice multiword expressions (mwes) are quite frequent in languages such as english, but their diversity, the scarcity of individual mwe types, and contextual ambiguity have presented obstacles to corpus-based studies and nlp systems addressing them as a class. here we advocate for a comprehensive annotation approach: proceeding sentence by sentence, our annotators manually group tokens into mwes according to guidelines that cover a broad range of multiword phenomena. under this scheme, we have fully annotated an english web corpus for multiword expressions, including those containing gaps.
quantification of bovine milk protein composition and coagulation properties using infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics: a result of collinearity among reference variables. the objective of this study was to examine variation in overall milk, protein, and mineral composition of bovine milk in relation to rennet-induced coagulation, with the aim of elucidating the underlying causes of milk with impaired coagulation abilities. on the basis of an initial screening of 892 milk samples from 42 herds with danish jersey and holstein-friesian cows, a subset of 102 samples was selected to represent milk with good, poor, or noncoagulating properties (i.e., samples that within each breed represented the most extremes in regard to coagulation properties). milk with good coagulation characteristics was defined as milk forming a strong coagulum based on oscillatory rheology, as indicated by high values for maximum coagulum strength (g'(max)) and curd firming rate (cfr) and a short rennet coagulation time. poorly coagulating milk formed a weak coagulum, with a low g'(max) and cfr and a long rennet coagulation time. noncoagulating milk was defined as milk that failed to form a coagulum, having g'(max) and cfr values of zero at measurements taken within 1h after addition of rennet. for both breeds, a lower content of total protein, total casein (cn) and κ-cn, and lower levels of minerals (ca, p, mg) were identified in poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk in comparison with milk with good coagulation properties. liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of a great variety of genetic variants of the major milk proteins, namely, α(s1)-cn (variants b and c), α(s2)-cn (a), β-cn (a(1), a(2), b, i, and f), κ-cn (a, b, and e), α-lactalbumin (b), and β-lactoglobulin (a, b, and c). in poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk samples of both breeds, the predominant composite genotype of α(s1)-, β-, and κ-cn was bb-a(2)a(2)-aa, which confirmed a genetic contribution to impaired milk coagulation. interestingly, subtle variations in posttranslational modification of cn were observed between the coagulation classes in both breeds. poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk contained a lower fraction of the least phosphorylated α(s1)-cn form, α(s1)-cn 8p, relative to total α(s1)-cn, along with a lower fraction of glycosylated κ-cn relative to total κ-cn. thus, apparent variation was observed in the milk and protein composition, in the genetic makeup of the major milk proteins, and in the posttranslational modification level of cn between milk samples with either good or impaired coagulation ability, whereas the composition of poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk was similar.
early outcomes of surgery for small bowel obstruction: analysis of risk factors aim gastrografin is a hyperosmolar water-soluble contrast medium. besides its predictive value for the need for operative treatment, a potential therapeutic role of this agent in adhesive small bowel obstruction has been suggested. this study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction when conservative treatment failed.   methods patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction were given trial conservative treatment unless there was fear of bowel strangulation. those responded in the initial 48 h had conservative treatment continued. patients who showed no improvement in the initial 48 h were given 100 ml of gastrografin through nasogastric tube followed by serial abdominal radiographs. patients with the contrast appeared in large bowel within 24 h were regarded as having partial obstruction and conservative treatment was continued. patients in which the contrast failed to reach large bowel within 24 h were considered to have complete obstruction and laparotomy was performed.   results two hundred and twelve patients with 245 episodes of adhesive obstruction were included. fifteen patients were operated on soon after admission due to fear of strangulation. one hundred and eighty-six episodes of obstruction showed improvement in the initial 48 h and conservative treatment was continued. two patients had subsequent operations because of persistent obstruction. forty-four episodes of obstruction showed no improvement within 48 h and gastrografin was administered. seven patients underwent complete obstruction surgery. partial obstruction was demonstrated in 37 other cases, obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them except one patient who required laparotomy because of persistent obstruction. the overall operative rate in this study was 10%. there was no complication that could be attributed to the use of gastrografin.   conclusion the use of gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction after unsuccessful conservative treatment is safe and reduces the need for surgical intervention.
fuse: full spectral clustering despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. first. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. in this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of matlab. using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. we also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.
training effective node classifiers for cascade classification pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision, with several applications that have the potential to positively impact quality of life. in recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. however, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. to address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. we make three primary contributions: 1) we put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. in particular, detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians.
conservation planning for biodiversity and wilderness: a real-world example marxan is software that delivers decision support for reserve system design. marxan was initially designed to solve a particular class of reserve design problems known as the minimum set problem (see box 1.1) where the goal is to achieve some minimum representation of biodiversity features for the smallest possible cost. marxan helps users to determine the possible contribution of individual areas and whole networks towards meeting their objectives. users may use marxan to explore and propose possible network configurations, to facilitate collaborative network design, or to guide their own land acquisition / marine zoning. marxan is not designed to act as a stand-alone reserve design solution. its effectiveness is dependent upon the involvement of people, the adoption of sound ecological principles, the establishment of scientifically defensible conservation goals and targets and the construction of spatial datasets. marxan should be used as part of a systematic conservation planning process (outlined in this chapter) and in collaboration with other forms of knowledge. these other forms of knowledge are essential to the refinement of marxan inputs, the interpretation of marxan outcomes and the precise placement of final reserve boundaries. because it seeks spatially efficient solutions, based on a defined problem, marxan represents a significant step forward from earlier approaches of scoring sites. nonetheless, there is a significant amount of uncertainty in selecting sites, which is but one aspect of systematic conservation planning, the final step of which is monitoring to evaluate whether the sites make meaningful contributions to the network. 1.1 overview of systematic conservation planning 1.1.1 what is systematic conservation planning? world-leading conservation planning processes, both marine and terrestrial, are employing an approach known as systematic conservation planning (pressey et al. 1993, noss and cooperrider 1994, davey 1998, pressey 1999, margules and pressey 2000, groves 2003, noss 2003, leslie 2005). systematic conservation planning focuses on locating, designing and managing protected areas that comprehensively represent the biodiversity of each region (mace et al. 2006). this approach to planning involves

use of healthcare, patient satisfaction and burden of care in guillain-barre syndrome. gottberg k, einarsson u, fredrikson s, von koch l, widén holmqvist l. multiple sclerosis in stockholm county. a pilot study of utilization of health‐care resources, patient satisfaction with care and impact on family caregivers.
skin barrier homeostasis in atopic dermatitis: feedback regulation of kallikrein activity apoptosis is an important physiological process crucially involved in development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. although the major signaling pathways have been unraveled, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying network remains elusive. we have translated here the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the death-receptor-activated caspase cascade into a mathematical model. a reduction down to the apoptotic core machinery enables the application of analytical mathematical methods to evaluate the system behavior within a wide range of parameters. using parameter values from the literature, the model reveals an unstable status of survival indicating the need for further control. based on recent publications we tested one additional regulatory mechanism at the level of initiator caspase activation and demonstrated that the resulting system displays desired characteristics such as bistability. in addition, the results from our model studies allowed us to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population.
immune antibodies and helminth products drive cxcr2-dependent macrophage-myofibroblast crosstalk to promote intestinal repair because abnormalities of mucosal immunity have been suggested in human iga nephropathy, we examined the involvement of mucosal immunity in iga deposition to the kidney in hyper iga (higa) mice, which was established as a mouse model for human iga nephropathy with hyperserum iga. the number of surface iga+b220− lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria (lp) of higa mice increased 2.7-fold at 30 wk of age as compared with those at 10 wk of age, whereas normal mice did not show such increase. the surface iga+b220− lp lymphocytes spontaneously secreted iga in culture. morphological studies showed that the surface iga+b220− lymphocytes of murine intestinal lp are identical with plasma cells (pcs). about 20% of iga+b220− pc in lp expressed both mac-1 and cd19, suggesting that they may derive from peritoneal b-1 cells. cell cycle study on intestinal iga-pcs using bromodeoxyuridine revealed no difference between higa mice and normal mice, suggesting that the high frequency of iga-producing pcs in higa mice is not due to enhanced proliferation or prolonged survival of iga-producing pcs in lp. in addition, iga secretion into the gut lumen of higa mice decreased drastically (to one forth) with aging. these data suggest that the increased number of intestinal iga-producing pcs and the down-regulation of iga excretion into the intestinal lumen might synergistically contribute to the hyperserum iga in higa mice and resultant iga deposition to the kidney.
learning to rank question answer pairs with holographic dual lstm architecture matching natural language sentences is central for many applications such as information retrieval and question answering. existing deep models rely on a single sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for matching. however, such methods cannot well capture the contextualized local information in the matching process. to tackle this problem, we present a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence representations. specifically, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (bi-lstm). the matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence representations, through $k$-max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. our model has several advantages: (1) by using bi-lstm, rich context of the whole sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each positional sentence representation; (2) by matching with multiple positional sentence representations, it is flexible to aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3) experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence completion demonstrate the superiority of our model.
relation between parent psychiatric symptoms and youth problems: moderation through family structure and youth gender context decades of randomized controlled trials have produced separate evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth, but these treatments are not often used in clinical practice, and they produce mixed results in trials with the comorbid, complex youths seen in practice. an integrative, modular redesign may help.   objective standard/separate and modular/integrated arrangements of evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth were compared with usual care treatment, with the modular design permitting a multidisorder focus and a flexible application of treatment procedures.   design randomized effectiveness trial.   setting ten outpatient clinical service organizations in massachusetts and hawaii.   participants a total of 84 community clinicians were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions for the treatment of 174 clinically referred youths who were 7 to 13 years of age (70% of these youths were boys, and 45% were white). the study was conducted during the period from january 12, 2005 to may 8, 2009.   interventions standard manual treatment (59 youths [34% of the sample]; cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, and behavioral parent training for conduct problems), modular treatment (62 youths [36%]; integrating the procedures of the 3 separate treatments), and usual care (53 youths [30%]).   main outcome measures outcomes were assessed using weekly youth and parent assessments. these assessments relied on a standardized brief problem checklist and a patient-generated top problems assessment (ie, the severity ratings on the problems that the youths and parents had identified as most important). we also conducted a standardized diagnostic assessment before and after treatment.   results mixed effects regression analyses showed that modular treatment produced significantly steeper trajectories of improvement than usual care and standard treatment on multiple brief problem checklist and top problems assessment measures. youths receiving modular treatment also had significantly fewer diagnoses than youths receiving usual care after treatment. in contrast, outcomes of standard manual treatment did not differ significantly from outcomes of usual care.   conclusions the modular approach outperformed usual care and standard evidence-based treatments on multiple clinical outcome measures. the modular approach may be a promising way to build on the strengths of evidence-based treatments, improving their utility and effectiveness with referred youths in clinical practice settings. trial registration  clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01178554.
detection and accurate localization of circular fiducials under highly challenging conditions over the last decades fiducial markers have provided widely adopted tools to add reliable model-based features into an otherwise general scene. given their central role in many computer vision tasks, countless different solutions have been proposed in the literature. some designs are focused on the accuracy of the recovered camera pose with respect to the tag; some other concentrate on reaching high detection speed or on recognizing a large number of distinct markers in the scene. in such a crowded area both the researcher and the practitioner are licensed to wonder if there is any need to introduce yet another approach. nevertheless, with this paper, we would like to present a general purpose fiducial marker system that can be deemed to add some valuable features to the pack. specifically, by exploiting the projective properties of a circular set of sizeable dots, we propose a detection algorithm that is highly accurate. further, applying a dot pattern scheme derived from error-correcting codes, allows for robustness with respect to very large occlusions. in addition, the design of the marker itself is flexible enough to accommodate different requirements in terms of pose accuracy and number of patterns. the overall performance of the marker system is evaluated in an extensive experimental section, where a comparison with a well-known baseline technique is presented.
the role of parallel signaling pathways in maintaining lymphoid cell survival to gain further insight into the role of raf-1 in normal cell growth, c-raf-1 mrna expression, raf-1 protein production, and raf-1-associated kinase activity in normal human t cells were analyzed. in contrast to the constitutive expression of raf-1 in continuously proliferating cell lines, c-raf-1 mrna and raf-1 protein levels were barely detectable in freshly isolated g0 t lymphocytes. previous work with fibroblasts has suggested that raf-1 plays a signaling role in the g0-g1 phase transition. in t cells, triggering via the t-cell antigen receptor (tcr)-cd3 complex (tcr/cd3) resulted in an approximately fourfold increase in c-raf-1 mrna. in addition, the promotion of g1 progression by interleukin 2 (il-2) was associated with a 5- to 10-fold immediate/early induction of c-raf-1 mrna, resulting in up to a 12-fold increase in raf-1 protein expression. tcr/cd3 activation did not alter the phosphorylation state of raf-1, whereas interleukin 2 receptor stimulation resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of a subpopulation of raf-1 molecules progressively increasing throughout g1. these findings were complemented by assays for raf-1-associated kinase activity which revealed a gradual accumulation of serine and threonine autokinase activity in raf-1 immunoprecipitates during g1, which remained elevated throughout dna replication.
the effects of water velocity on the ceratomyxa shasta infectious cycle. myxobolus cerebralis, the myxozoan parasite responsible for whirling disease in salmonid fishes, has a complex life-cycle involving an invertebrate host and 2 spore stages. water flow rate is an environmental variable thought to affect the establishment and propagation of m. cerebralis; however, experimental data that separates flow effects from those of other variables are scarce. to compare how this parameter affected parasite infection dynamics and the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts, dead, infected fish were introduced into a naive habitat with susceptible hosts under 2 experimental flow regimes: slow (0 x 02 cm/s) and fast (2 x 0 cm/s). throughout the 1-year study, uninfected fry were held in both systems, the outflows were screened weekly for spores and the annelid populations were monitored. we found clear differences in prevalence of infection in the worms, prevalence and severity of infection in the fish, and host survival. both flows provided environments in which m. cerebralis could complete its life-cycle; however, both the parasite and its invertebrate host proliferated to a greater extent in the slow flow environment over the 1-year study period. this finding is of significance for aquatic systems where the flow rate can be manipulated, and should be incorporated into risk analysis assessments.
age-dependent regression analysis of male gonadal axis. pulsatile and thus total testosterone (te) secretion declines in older men, albeit for unknown reasons. analytical models forecast that aging may reduce the capability of endogenous luteinizing hormone (lh) pulses to stimulate leydig cell steroidogenesis. this notion has been difficult to test experimentally. the present study used graded doses of a selective gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh)-receptor antagonist to yield four distinct strata of pulsatile lh release in each of 18 healthy men ages 23-72 yr. deconvolution analysis was applied to frequently sampled lh and te concentration time series to quantitate pulsatile te secretion over a 16-h interval. log-linear regression was used to relate pulsatile lh secretion to attendant pulsatile te secretion (lh-te drive) across the four stepwise interventions in each subject. linear regression of the 18 individual estimates of lh-te feedforward dose-response slopes on age disclosed a strongly negative relationship (r = -0.721, p < 0.001). accordingly, the present data support the thesis that aging in healthy men attenuates amplitude-dependent lh drive of burst-like te secretion. the experimental strategy of graded suppression of neuroglandular outflow may have utility in estimating dose-response adaptations in other endocrine systems.
proteome analysis of streptococcus mutans metabolic phenotype during acid tolerance. a plaque growth chamber was developed for long-term growth of five separate plaques from the same plaque or saliva sample under identical conditions of temperature and gas phase. reagent addition and growth conditions for each plaque could be independently controlled, and each was accessible for sequential sampling and electrode insertion. plaques were cultured for over six weeks on pellicle-coated lux (tm) 25-mm diameter cover-slips at 35°c under 5% co2 in n 2, and supplied with a medium containing 0.25% mucin (bmm) at 3.6 ml/h, and with periodic 5% sucrose. electron microscopy and flora analysis of microcosm plaques showed that they had close similarities to reported characteristics of natural dental plaques. diverse motile bacteria were present. sucrose-induced stephan ph curves and urea-induced ph rises were also similar to those reported for natural plaques. changes in plaque urease, calcium, phosphate concentrations, and the flora were followed over five weeks in a plaque supplied with bmm containing additional 2.5 mmol/l calcium and 7.5 mmol/l phosphate. despite this high environmental calcium phosphate concentration, there was no continuing increase in calcium levels, although plaque phosphate doubled. urease levels fluctuated. changes in the cultivable flora were minor. a urea-containing calcium phosphate/ mono-fluorophosphate ph 5 solution, applied for six min every two h for seven days, increased plaque calcium, phosphate, and fluoride to high levels. thus, plaques grown over several weeks in the multi-station artificial mouth exhibited metabolic and ph behavior typical of natural plaques, could be analyzed during development, and the system allowed manipulation of environmental variables important in plaque ph control and calcification.
genome-wide associations between genetic and epigenetic variation influence mrna expression and insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets type 1 diabetes (t1d) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. we report the findings of a genome-wide association study of t1d, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. the total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with t1d in the meta-analysis (p < 10−6). after excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (asp) families. of these, 18 regions were replicated (p < 0.01; overall p < 5 × 10−8) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (p < 0.05). the many new candidate genes suggested by these results include il10, il19, il20, glis3, cd69 and il27.

fuzzy geographically weighted clustering using artificial bee colony: an efficient geo-demographic analysis algorithm and applications to the analysis of crime behavior in population geographic information systems (gis) play a very important role to researches and industries. in fact, there have been some studies related to the development of this kind of systems as well as methods of mining attribute gis data. in this paper, we will explore an aspect of data mining in gis, that is, gis clustering for geo-demographic analysis and present a novel context-based fuzzy geographically weighted clustering algorithm to solve such task.
saps 3 score as a predictive factor for postoperative referral to intensive care unit objectiverisk adjustment systems now in use were developed more than a decade ago and lack prognostic performance. objective of the saps 3 study was to collect data about risk factors and outcomes in a heterogeneous cohort of intensive care unit (icu) patients, in order to develop a new, improved model for risk adjustment.designprospective multicentre, multinational cohort study.patients and settinga total of 19,577 patients consecutively admitted to 307 icus from 14 october to 15 december 2002.measurements and resultsdata were collected at icu admission, on days 1, 2 and 3, and the last day of the icu stay. data included sociodemographics, chronic conditions, diagnostic information, physiological derangement at icu admission, number and severity of organ dysfunctions, length of icu and hospital stay, and vital status at icu and hospital discharge. data reliability was tested with use of kappa statistics and intraclass-correlation coefficients, which were >0.85 for the majority of variables. completeness of the data was also satisfactory, with 1 [0–3] saps ii parameter missing per patient. prognostic performance of the saps ii was poor, with significant differences between observed and expected mortality rates for the overall cohort and four (of seven) defined regions, and poor calibration for most tested subgroups.conclusionsthe saps 3 study was able to provide a high-quality multinational database, reflecting heterogeneity of current icu case-mix and typology. the poor performance of saps ii in this cohort underscores the need for development of a new risk adjustment system for critically ill patients.
information extraction in the web era written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning. since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed at different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still presents major difficulties. a statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described. steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.
machine learning and non-negative compressive sampling the new emerging theory of compressive sampling has demonstrated that by exploiting the structure of a signal, it is possible to sample a signal below the nyquist rate and achieve perfect reconstruction. in this short note, we employ non-negative matrix factorisation in the context of compressive sampling and propose two nmf algorithms for signal recovery—one of which utilises iteratively reweighted least squares. the algorithms are applied to compressively sampled non-negative data, where a sparse non-negative basis and corresponding non-negative coefficients for the original uncompressed data are discovered directly in the compressively sampled domain.
application of metabolomics to study effects of bariatric surgery chronological age is one of the most important risk factors for adverse clinical outcome. still, two individuals at the same chronological age could have different biological aging states, leading to different individual risk profiles. capturing this individual variance could constitute an even more powerful predictor enhancing prediction in age-related morbidity. applying a nonlinear regression technique, we constructed a metabonomic measurement for biological age, the metabolic age score, based on urine data measured via (1)h nmr spectroscopy. we validated the score in two large independent population-based samples by revealing its significant associations with chronological age and age-related clinical phenotypes as well as its independent predictive value for survival over approximately 13 years of follow-up. furthermore, the metabolic age score was prognostic for weight loss in a sample of individuals who underwent bariatric surgery. we conclude that the metabolic age score is an informative measurement of biological age with possible applications in personalized medicine.

a best-worst scaling survey of adolescents' level of concern for health and non-health consequences of smoking. background: one of the greatest difficulties in evaluating healthcare system reform in any country is that governments often do not clearly articulate what it is they are attempting to do. in australia, a recent inquiry set out 15 principles to guide the reform process, but it remains unclear how the australian public values the principles, how such values vary across the country, and, more fundamentally, if australians understand the principles.objectives: to evaluate the australian healthcare reform principles from the perspective of the australian public, to test if such preferences are valued consistently across geographic and socioeconomic strata, and to test for the degree of understanding of the principles among the public.methods: we employed best-worst scaling (bws), a stated-preference method grounded in random utility theory, to elicit public preference for 15 healthcare reform principles. the bws tasks were incorporated into an online survey that also gathered geographic and socioeconomic information and included questions relating to the understanding of the reform principles. respondents were a geographically diverse set of australians who were randomized to receive one of two versions of the survey, each containing a block of 15 choice tasks. tasks in block one contained a subset of the choice tasks containing subsets of seven principles based on a balanced incomplete block design, while tasks in block two contained tasks with eight principles defined by the complement of the former.in each bws task, respondents were simply asked to identify the most and least important principle. analysis of preference was based on assigning the most valued principles a ‘1’ and the least valued principles ‘−1’, and with each item appearing eight times in each block, preferences were analyzed over a cardinal utility scale bounded by −8 and +8. analysis was based on simple summary statistics and stratified by geographic and socioeconomic measures.results: a sample of 204 respondents participated in the survey (a participation rate of 85%). quality and safety was the most important principle and a culture of reflective improvement and innovation was the least important. public voice and community engagement was the second least important principle and was also understood by barely half the respondents.conclusions: this research demonstrates how random-utility-based methods can be used to provide estimates of the importance of reform principles that have known statistical properties. the bws task used forced respondents to discriminate between the principles on offer, unlike rating scales. researchers and practitioners in healthcare should consider using bws tasks in preference to rating scales.
calculating pulmonary-mode-lethality risk avoidance associated with radionuclide decorporation countermeasures related to a radiological terrorism incident this paper provides theoretical health-risk-assessment tools that are designed to facilitate planning for and managing radiological terrorism incidents that involve ingestion exposure to bone-seeking radionuclides (e.g., radiostrontium nuclides). the focus is on evaluating lethality risk avoidance (rav; i.e., the decrease in risk) that is associated with radionuclide decorporation countermeasures employed to remove ingested bone-seeking beta and/or gamma-emitting radionuclides from the body. to illustrate the application of tools presented, hypothetical radiostrontium decorporation scenarios were considered that involved evaluating the hematopoietic-mode-lethality rav. for evaluating the efficacy of specific decorporation countermeasures, the lethality risk avoidance proportion (rap; which is the rav divided by the total lethality risk in the absence of protective countermeasures) is introduced. the lethality rap is expected to be a useful tool for designing optimal radionuclide decorporation schemes and for identifying green, yellow and red dose-rate zones. for the green zone, essentially all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided (rap = 1) as a consequence of the radionuclide decorporation scheme used. for the yellow zone, some but not all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided. for the red zone, none of the lethality risk (which equals 1) is expected to be avoided.
stream-packing: resource allocation in web server farms with a qos guarantee statistical sharing over several timescales is a key feature of the internet, and is likely to be an essential aspect of future atm networks. in this chapter we describe how usage-sensitive pricing can encourage statistical sharing, and we provide a quantitative framework for the discussion of pricing issues in systems where statistical sharing is important. in particular we describe a simple charging and accounting mechanism for real-time bursty connections, based on the concept of an eeective bandwidth. the mechanism performs the dual role of conveying information to the network that allows more eecient statistical sharing, and information to the user about the resource implications of diierently policed connection requests. the resulting tarii takes a strikingly simple form: a charge a(x) per unit time, a charge b(x) per unit volume of traac carried, and a charge c(x) per connection, where the triple (a(x); b(x); c(x)) are xed at the time of connection acceptance as a function of the connection contract x. this form of tarii is also able to reveal user preferences concerning delay tolerant traac, and thus promises to provide a uniied pricing model over a wide range of quality of service classes.
microemulsion based gel for topical dermal delivery of pseudolaric acid b: in vitro and in vivo evaluation. the objective was to develop a ternary skin targeting system for ketoconazole (ket) using a combined strategy of microemulsion (me) and cyclodextrin (hp-β-cd), i.e., ket-cd-me, which exploits both virtues of cyclodextrin complex and me to obtain the synergetic effect. ket-cd-me was formulated using labrafil m 1944 cs as oil phase, solutol hs 15 as surfactant, transcutol p as cosurfactant, and hp-β-cd solution as aqueous phase. the formulation of ket-cd-me was optimized and the optimal formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, size distribution, ph value, and viscosity. long term stability experiment showed that hp-β-cd could increase the physical stability of ternary system and ket chemical stability. percutaneous permeation of ket from ket-cd-me in vitro through rat skin was investigated in comparison with ket microemulsion (ket-me), ket hp-β-cd inclusion solution (ket-cd), ket aqueous suspension, and commercial ket cream; the results showed that the combination of me with hp-β-cd exhibited significantly synergistic effect on ket deposition within the skin (29.38 ± 1.79 μg/cm(2)) and a slightly synergistic effect on ket penetration through the skin (11.3 μg/cm(2)/h). the enhancement of the combination on skin deposition was further visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope (clsm). in vitro sensitivity against candida parapsilosis test indicated that ket-cd-me enhanced ket antifungal activity mainly owing to the solubilization of hp-β-cd on ket in the ternary system. moreover, the interactions between hp-β-cd and ket in the ternary system were elucidated through microscale thermophoresis (mst) and 2d (1)h nmr spectroscopy. the profiles from mst confirmed the host-guest interactions of hp-β-cd with ket in the ternary system and a deep insight into the interactions between ket and hp-β-cd were obtained by means of 2d (1)h nmr spectroscopy. the results indicate that the ternary system of me combination with hp-β-cd may be a promising approach for skin targeting delivery of ket.
gonadal differentiation and temperature effects on sex determination in the freshwater pike silverside chirostoma estor jordan 1880 elevated water temperature has been found to cause gonadal degeneration in fish, including the partial or complete loss of germinal elements, and might impair fertility and reproductive performance. germ cell–deficient and even completely sterile pejerrey odontesthes bonariensis have been found in two lagoons in argentina, and exposure to warm water is one of the possible causes of these abnormalities. this experiment was conducted (a) to compare the histological characteristics of the abnormal gonads from wild pejerrey with those of animals exposed to heat in the laboratory and (b) to examine whether short‐term pulses of heat similar to diurnal temperature variations in natural environments during summer can trigger gonadal cell degeneration in adult pejerrey. wild fish with gonadal abnormalities were obtained from the san miguel del monte and lacombe lagoons (buenos aires province, argentina). laboratory specimens were obtained by exposure of adult pejerrey to five thermal regimes (constant 24° and 29°c and 12‐h cycles of 27°–31°, 28°–30°, and 28°–31°c) for up to 16 wk. germ cell–deficient specimens for histological comparison with wild animals were also obtained by exposing larvae and juveniles for 8–12 wk to 29°c and rearing until they became adults. the histological characteristics of the abnormal gonads of wild pejerrey closely resembled those of fish partially or completely sterilized by high water temperature in the laboratory. the results indicate that fluctuating (high) thermal regimes triggered germ cell disappearance in a manner comparable to a constant temperature of 29°c. these results support the notion that high temperature during unusually warm summers might trigger germ cell degeneration and could be the cause of the observed gonadal abnormalities in wild pejerrey.
novel serum proteomic signatures in a non-human primate model of retinal injury purpose ureteropelvic junction obstruction may either worsen and require surgery, improve or remain stable. it may take upward of 3 years for the natural history to unfold. urinary proteome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry has been shown to differentiate between normal infants and those with ureteropelvic junction obstruction. we sought to confirm these findings using liquid chromatography/nano-spray mass spectrometry to examine the urinary proteome in patients with unilateral grade iv ureteropelvic junction obstruction compared to age matched healthy infants.   materials and methods urine specimens were obtained from 21 healthy infants with normal maternal/fetal ultrasound and 25 infants with grade iv unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction. specimens were prepared using standard methods and subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. normalized data were annotated using the ipa(r) knowledge platform.   results there were 31 proteins significantly different in their level of abundance at 1 to 6 months, and 18 at 7 to 12 months compared to age matched controls. these proteins clustered into major functional networks. all of the biomarkers previously reported in clinical studies of ureteropelvic junction obstruction were observed with the notable exception of transforming growth factor-beta1.   conclusions these results confirm the presence of significant differences in the urinary proteome in unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction compared to age matched normal individuals. this study adds new information about levels of abundance of specific proteins and peptides in ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which may allow for better classification of disease subgroups and help to establish improved indications for the early selection of surgical candidates based on urinary protein biomarkers.
comparative study of trace elements in blood, scalp hair and nails of prostate cancer patients in relation to healthy donors background gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer which is predominantly associated with the environmental factors. the carcinogenic processes are linked with the imbalances of trace metals in body fluid and tissues.   methods trace metals (cd, cr, cu, fe, ni, pb and zn) are estimated in blood plasma and scalp hair of the cancer patients and controls employing nitric acid-perchloric acid based wet-digestion followed by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method.   results the mean concentrations of cd, cr, cu and ni were found to be significantly higher in the plasma of patients compared with the controls, however, appreciably higher concentrations of fe and zn were observed in the plasma of controls. the average scalp hair concentrations of zn, fe, pb, cu and cd were notably higher in the patients than controls. the correlation study revealed significantly different mutual variations of the trace metals in the plasma and scalp hair of the patients and controls. the apportionment of trace metals in the plasma and scalp hair of the patients and controls was also considerably different.   conclusions the study revealed that the carcinogenic processes are significantly affecting the trace metal burden and mutual variations in the cancerous patients compared with the controls.
improving positive parenting skills and reducing harsh and abusive parenting in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions is the official document that describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of healthcare interventions.
training quantized nets: a deeper understanding groups at mit and nyu have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. it is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. we show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. a second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. we created two sets of reliable labels. the cifar-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the cifar-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.
high normal fasting glucose level in obese youth: a marker for insulin resistance and beta cell dysregulation given the extreme increase in prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and the potential for metabolic syndrome in obese youth, identifying simplified indexes for assessing stimulated insulin sensitivity is critical. the purpose of this study was validation of two surrogate indexes of insulin sensitivity determined from the oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): the composite whole body insulin sensitivity index (wbisi) and the insulin sensitivity index (isi). an obese population (aged 8-18 yr) of normal and impaired glucose tolerance individuals was studied. one group (n = 38) performed both the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and ogtt for comparison of insulin sensitivity measurements as well as (1)h-magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimates of intramyocellular lipid content. another larger (n = 368) cohort participated only in an ogtt. both the wbisi and isi represented good estimates (r = 0.78 and 0.74; p < 0.0005) for clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (glucose disposed, m-value), respectively. in the large cohort, the surrogate indexes demonstrated the shift toward poorer function and increased risk profile as a function of insulin resistance. additionally, the wbisi and isi correlated with intramyocellular lipid content (r = -0.74 and -0.71; p < 0.0001), a tissue marker for insulin resistance. insulin sensitivity can be estimated using plasma glucose and insulin responses derived from the ogtt in obese youth with normal and impaired glucose tolerance.
empirical datasets for energies journal article 'from theory to econometrics to energy policy: cautionary tales for policymaking using aggregate production functions' national exergy efficiency analysis relates the quality of primary energy inputs to an economy with end useful work in sectoral energy uses such as transport, heat and electrical devices. this approach has been used by a range of authors to explore insights to macroscale energy systems and linkages with economic growth. however, these analyses use a variety of calculation methods with sometimes coarse assumptions, inhibiting comparisons. therefore, building on previous studies, this paper first contributes toward a common useful work accounting framework, by developing more refined methodological techniques for electricity end use and transport exergy efficiencies. second, to test this more consistent and granular approach, these advances are applied to the us and uk for 1960 to 2010. the results reveal divergent aggregate exergy efficiencies: us efficiency remains stable at around 11%, while uk efficiency rises from 9% to 15%. the us efficiency stagnation is due to "efficiency dilution", where structural shifts to lower efficiency consumption (e.g., air-conditioning) outweigh device-level efficiency gains. the results demonstrate this is an important area of research, with consequent implications for national energy efficiency policies.
a prospective randomized trial of content expertise versus process expertise in small group teaching purpose: to examine an instrument for evaluating clinical teaching using factor analysis and to refine the validated instrument to a practical length. method: factor analysis on a split sample of 1,581 student evaluations rating 178 teachers. the instrument was based on the seven-category stanford faculty development program's (sfdp's) clinical teaching framework and contained 58 likert-scaled items, with at least seven items per category plus five items measuring “teacher's knowledge.” standard methodology for survey item reduction was used to remove items with low or complex factor loadings and iteratively remove items with low item-scale correlation. results were replicated on the second sample. results: the seven original categories emerged and items originally categorized under “knowledge” statistically combined with “promoting self-directed learning.” over 73% of the variance was explained. item reduction resulted in 25 items with overall internal consistency over .97 and internal consistency of constructs ranging from .82 to .95. conclusions: factor analysis of student ratings validated the seven-category sfdp framework. an abbreviated instrument to measure the seven categories is described. results suggest that students may not systematically distinguish between their teachers' knowledge and their teachers' ability to promote self-directed learning, an important finding for both administrators and faculty development programs.
a new species of andinobates (amphibia: anura: dendrobatidae) from west central panama. the poison frogs of the colombian andes, pacific lowlands and panama have been recently recognized as a new, monophyletic and well-supported genus: andinobates. the species richness and distribution within andinobates remain poorly understood due to the paucity of geographic, genetic and phenotypic data. here we use a combination of molecular, bioacoustic and morphometric evidence to describe a new species of andean poison frog: andinobates cassidyhornae sp. nov. from the high elevation cloud forests of the colombian cordillera occidental, in the northwestern andes. the new species is associated to the bombetes group and characterized by a unique combination of ventral and dorsal color patterns. data on 1119 bp from two mitochondrial markers allowed us to reject the null hypotheses that a. cassidyhornae sp. nov. is part of the phenotypically similar and geographically less distant species: a. opisthomelas, a. virolinensis or a. bombetes. the best available phylogenetic trees and the genetic distance to other andinobates species further support this decision. altogether, the advertisement call parameters unambiguously separated a. cassidyhornae sp. nov. calls from the calls of the three closest species. the new species adds to a poorly known and highly endangered genus of poison frogs that requires further studies and urgent conservation measures.
silencing smoc2 ameliorates kidney fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation. research on fibroblast biology in three-dimensional collagen matrices offers new opportunities to understand the reciprocal and adaptive interactions that occur between cells and surrounding matrix in a tissue-like environment. such interactions are integral to the regulation of connective tissue morphogenesis and dynamics that characterizes tissue homeostasis and wound repair. during fibroblast-collagen matrix remodeling, mechanical signals from the remodeled matrix feed back to modulate cell behavior in an iterative process. as mechanical loading (tension) within the matrix increases, the mechanisms used by cells to remodel the matrix change. fibroblasts in matrices that are under tension or relaxed respond differently to growth factor stimulation, and switching between mechanically loaded and unloaded conditions influences whether cells acquire proliferative/biosynthetic active or quiescent/resting phenotypes.
anemia and performance status as prognostic markers in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the early warning score (ews) is a simple physiological scoring system suitable for bedside application. the ability of a modified early warning score (mews) to identify medical patients at risk of catastrophic deterioration in a busy clinical area was investigated. in a prospective cohort study, we applied mews to patients admitted to the 56-bed acute medical admissions unit (mau) of a district general hospital (dgh). data on 709 medical emergency admissions were collected during march 2000. main outcome measures were death, intensive care unit (icu) admission, high dependency unit (hdu) admission, cardiac arrest, survival and hospital discharge at 60 days. scores of 5 or more were associated with increased risk of death (or 5.4, 95%ci 2.8-10.7), icu admission (or 10.9, 95%ci 2.2-55.6) and hdu admission (or 3.3, 95%ci 1.2-9.2). mews can be applied easily in a dgh medical admission unit, and identifies patients at risk of deterioration who require increased levels of care in the hdu or icu. a clinical pathway could be created, using nurse practitioners and/or critical care physicians, to respond to high scores and intervene with appropriate changes in clinical management.
sparsity-based no-reference image quality assessment for automatic denoising sharpness is an important determinant in visual assessment of image quality. the human visual system is able to effortlessly detect blur and evaluate sharpness of visual images, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. existing blur/sharpness evaluation algorithms are mostly based on edge width, local gradient, or energy reduction of global/local high frequency content. here we understand the subject from a different perspective, where sharpness is identified as strong local phase coherence (lpc) near distinctive image features evaluated in the complex wavelet transform domain. previous lpc computation is restricted to be applied to complex coefficients spread in three consecutive dyadic scales in the scale-space. here we propose a flexible framework that allows for lpc computation in arbitrary fractional scales. we then develop a new sharpness assessment algorithm without referencing the original image. we use four subject-rated publicly available image databases to test the proposed algorithm, which demonstrates competitive performance when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.
pcr-based identification of klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, the agent of rhinoscleroma in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, the core oligosaccharide backbone of the lipopolysaccharide is modified by phosphoryl groups. the negative charges provided by these residues are important in maintaining the barrier function of the outer membrane. in contrast, klebsiella pneumoniae lacks phosphoryl groups in its core oligosaccharide but instead contains galacturonic acid residues that are proposed to serve a similar function in outer membrane stability. gla(kp) is a udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase that provides udp-galacturonic acid for core synthesis, and the enzyme was biochemically characterized because of its potentially important role in outer membrane stability. high-performance anion-exchange chromatography was used to demonstrate the udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase activity of gla(kp), and capillary electrophoresis was used for activity assays. the reaction equilibrium favors udp-galacturonic acid over udp-glucuronic acid in a ratio of 1.4:1, with the k(m) for udp-glucuronic acid of 13.0 microm. gla(kp) exists as a dimer in its native form. nad+/nadh is tightly bound by the enzyme and addition of supplementary nad+ is not required for activity of the purified enzyme. divalent cations have an unexpected inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. gla(kp) was found to have a broad substrate specificity in vitro; it is capable of interconverting udp-glucose/udp-galactose and udp-n-acetylglucosamine/udp-n-acetylgalactosamine, albeit at much lower activity. the epimerase gale interconverts udp-glucose/udp-galactose. multicopy plasmid-encoded gla(kp) partially complemented a gale mutation in s. enterica and in k. pneumoniae; however, chromosomal gla(kp) could not substitute for gale in a k. pneumoniae gale mutant in vivo.
biexponential longitudinal relaxation in white matter: characterization and impact on t1 mapping with ir‐fse and mp2rage brain water proton (1h2o) longitudinal relaxation time constants (t1) were obtained from three healthy individuals at magnetic field strengths (b0) of 0.2 tesla (t), 1.0t, 1.5t, 4.0t, and 7.0t. a 5‐mm midventricular axial slice was sampled using a modified look‐locker technique with 1.5 mm in‐plane resolution, and 32 time points post‐adiabatic inversion. the results confirmed that for most brain tissues, t1 values increased by more than a factor of 3 between 0.2t and 7t, and over this range were well fitted by t1 (s) = 0.583(b0)0.382, t1(s) = 0.857(b0)0.376, and t1(s) = 1.35(b0)0.340 for white matter (wm), internal gm, and blood 1h2o, respectively. the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (csf) 1h2o t1 value did not change with b0, and its average value (standard deviation (sd)) across subjects and magnetic fields was 4.3 (±0.2) s. the tissue 1/t1 values at each field were well correlated with the macromolecular mass fraction, and to a lesser extent tissue iron content. the field‐dependent increases in 1h2o t1 values more than offset the well‐known decrease in typical mri contrast reagent (cr) relaxivity, and simulations predict that this leads to lower cr concentration detection thresholds with increased magnetic field. magn reson med 57:308–318, 2007. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
validation of activity tracking procedures in elderly patients after operative treatment of proximal femur fractures we have studied the effect of shortening of the femoral neck and varus collapse on the functional capacity and quality of life of patients who had undergone fixation of an isolated intracapsular fracture of the hip with cancellous screws. after screening 660 patients at four university medical centres, 70 patients with a mean age of 71 years (20 to 90) met the inclusion criteria. overall, 66% (46 of 70) of the fractures healed with > 5 mm of shortening and 39% (27 of 70) with > 5 degrees of varus. patients with severe shortening of the femoral neck had significantly lower short form-36 questionnaire (sf-36) physical functioning scores (no/mild (<5 mm) vs severe shortening (> 10 mm); 74 vs 42 points, p < 0.001). a similar effect was noted with moderate shortening, suggesting a gradient effect (no/mild (< 5 mm) vs moderate shortening (5 to 10 mm); 74 vs 53 points, p = 0.011). varus collapse correlated moderately with the occurrence of shortening (r = 0.66, p < 0.001). shortening also resulted in a significantly lower euroqol questionnaire (eq5d) index scores (p = 0.05). in a regression analysis shortening of the femoral neck was the only significant variable predictive of a low sf-36 physical functioning score (p < 0.001).
aortic stiffness and ambulatory blood pressure as predictors of diabetic kidney disease: a competing risks analysis from the rio de janeiro type 2 diabetes cohort study objective the action in diabetes and vascular disease: preterax and diamicron mr controlled evaluation (advance) trial reported that intensive glucose control prevents end-stage kidney disease (eskd) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but uncertainty about the balance between risks and benefits exists. here, we examine the long-term effects of intensive glucose control on risk of eskd and other outcomes. research design and methods survivors, previously randomized to intensive or standard glucose control, were invited to participate in post-trial follow-up. eskd, defined as the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, or death due to kidney disease, was documented overall and by baseline ckd stage, along with hypoglycemic episodes, major cardiovascular events, and death from other causes. results a total of 8,494 advance participants were followed for a median of 5.4 additional years. in-trial hba1c differences disappeared by the first post-trial visit. the in-trial reductions in the risk of eskd (7 vs. 20 events, hazard ratio [hr] 0.35, p = 0.02) persisted after 9.9 years of overall follow-up (29 vs. 53 events, hr 0.54, p < 0.01). these effects were greater in earlier-stage ckd (p = 0.04) and at lower baseline systolic blood pressure levels (p = 0.01). the effects of glucose lowering on the risks of death, cardiovascular death, or major cardiovascular events did not differ by levels of kidney function (p > 0.26). conclusions intensive glucose control was associated with a long-term reduction in eskd, without evidence of any increased risk of cardiovascular events or death. these benefits were greater with preserved kidney function and with well-controlled blood pressure.
newly isolated but uncultivated magnetotactic bacterium of the phylum nitrospirae from beijing, china a combination of polymerase chain reaction-assisted rrna sequence retrieval and fluorescent oligonucleotide probing was used to identify in situ a hitherto unculturable, big, magnetotactic, rod-shaped organism in freshwater sediment samples collected from lake chiemsee. tentatively named "magnetobacterium bavaricum," this bacterium is evolutionarily distant from all other phylogenetically characterized magnetotactic bacteria and contains unusually high numbers of magnetosomes (up to 1,000 magnetosomes per cell). the spatial distribution in the sediment was studied, and up to 7 x 10 active cells per cm were found in the microaerobic zone. considering its average volume (25.8 +/- 4.1 mum) and relative abundance (0.64 +/- 0.17%), "m. bavaricum" may account for approximately 30% of the microbial biovolume and may therefore be a dominant fraction of the microbial community in this layer. its microhabitat and its high content of sulfur globules and magnetosomes suggest that this organism has an iron-dependent way of energy conservation which depends on balanced gradients of oxygen and sulfide.
multimodal imaging of mild traumatic brain injury and persistent postconcussion syndrome objectives to examine patterns of brain activation while performing a working memory task in persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi) and healthy controls. it is well established that working memory is an area of cognition that is especially vulnerable to disruption after tbi. although much has been learned about the system of cerebral representation of working memory in healthy people, little is known about how this system is disrupted by tbi.   methods functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) was used to assess brain activation during a working memory task (a modified version of the paced auditory serial addition test) in nine patients with tbi and seven healthy controls.   results patients with tbi were able to perform the task, but made significantly more errors than healthy controls. cerebral activation in both groups was found in similar regions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and resembled patterns of activation found in previous neuroimaging studies of working memory in healthy persons. however, compared with the healthy controls, the tbi group displayed a pattern of cerebral activation that was more regionally dispersed and more lateralised to the right hemisphere. differences in lateralisation were particularly evident in the frontal lobes.   conclusions impairment of working memory in tbi seems to be associated with alterations in functional cerebral activity.
coronaviruses and arteriviruses display striking differences in their cyclophilin a-dependence during replication in cell culture the gene expression of plus-strand rna viruses with a polycistronic genome depends on translation and replication of the genomic mrna, as well as synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mrnas. arteriviruses and coronaviruses, distantly related members of the nidovirus order, employ a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand rna synthesis to generate subgenome-length templates for the synthesis of a nested set of sg mrnas. non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (eav), a multifunctional regulator of viral rna synthesis and virion biogenesis, was previously implicated in controlling the balance between genome replication and sg mrna synthesis. here, we employed reverse and forward genetics to gain insight into the multiple regulatory roles of nsp1. our analysis revealed that the relative abundance of viral mrnas is tightly controlled by an intricate network of interactions involving all nsp1 subdomains. distinct nsp1 mutations affected the quantitative balance among viral mrna species, and our data implicate nsp1 in controlling the accumulation of full-length and subgenome-length minus-strand templates for viral mrna synthesis. the moderate differential changes in viral mrna abundance of nsp1 mutants resulted in similarly altered viral protein levels, but progeny virus yields were greatly reduced. pseudorevertant analysis provided compelling genetic evidence that balanced eav mrna accumulation is critical for efficient virus production. this first report on protein-mediated, mrna-specific control of nidovirus rna synthesis reveals the existence of an integral control mechanism to fine-tune replication, sg mrna synthesis, and virus production, and establishes a major role for nsp1 in coordinating the arterivirus replicative cycle.
motion‐corrected simultaneous cardiac positron emission tomography and coronary mr angiography with high acquisition efficiency noninvasive imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of heart failure, assessment of prognosis, and monitoring of therapy. cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) offers a comprehensive assessment of heart failure patients and is now the gold standard imaging technique to assess myocardial anatomy, regional and global function, and viability. furthermore, it allows assessment of perfusion and acute tissue injury (edema and necrosis), whereas in nonischemic heart failure, fibrosis, infiltration, and iron overload can be detected. the information derived from cmr often reveals the underlying etiology of heart failure, and its high measurement accuracy makes it an ideal technique for monitoring disease progression and the effects of treatment. evidence on the prognostic value of cmr-derived parameters in heart failure is rapidly emerging. this review summarizes the advantages of cmr for patients with heart failure and its important role in key areas.
radioactive iodine administration is associated with persistent related symptoms in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer salivary gland side effects (sses) can be a source of significant morbidity in thyroid cancer patients receiving radioactive iodine (rai) for remnant ablation or therapy. however, the incidence, time course, and ultimate resolution of sses that develop in the first few months after a single administered activity of rai for remnant ablation has not be adequately defined. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients after rai remnant ablation (rra) to determine the incidence of salivary gland–related side effects reported within the first year of rra, the dose-response relationship between administered activity and specific sses, and the incidence of specific sses based on the method of preparation for remnant ablation (recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone [rhtsh] vs. traditional thyroid hormone withdrawal [thw]). results: sses were reported within the first year of rai ablation in 39% of a cohort of 262 patients (66% women, 93% papillary thyroid cancer; median dose, 5,217 mbq [141 mci]). persistent side effects were noted after a median of 7 y in 5% or less of the entire cohort. however, when side effects developed in patients during the first year, the incidence of persistence of the symptom at last follow-up ranged from 5% to 13%. a statistically significant dose response was seen between administered activity of rai and development of salivary gland swelling (p = 0.001, logistic dose-response curve) but not with dry mouth (p = 0.63), altered taste (p = 0.27), or salivary gland pain (p = 0.152). sses developed in 14% of patients receiving administered activities of 1,110 mbq (30 mci); administered activities of 2,775 mbq (75 mci) or more were associated with symptoms in 40% of patients (p = 0.046). despite receiving a statistically higher administered activity (5,661 ± 2,997 mbq [153 ± 81 mci] for thw vs. 4,958 ± 2,294 mbq [134 ± 62 mci] for rhtsh), thw was associated with a lower rate of salivary gland swelling than the rhtsh preparation (20% vs. 10%; p = 0.017), without differences in the development of dry mouth, altered taste, or salivary gland pain. conclusion: although sses occurred in 39% of patients after routine rra, they were usually transient, so that the overall incidence of persistent side effects at a median follow-up of 7 y was only 5%. even though the risk for persistent side effects is rather small, these data do emphasize the need to select patients carefully for rra who are thought to be at moderate to high risk for recurrence and to use the minimally effective dose of rai activity, in an attempt to maximize the potential benefit while minimizing the risk for adverse events for an individual patient.
evolution of occupational exposure to environmental levels of aromatic hydrocarbons in service stations. work on deck on eight oil product tankers was examined. the purpose was to evaluate the need for improvement of the working environment to reduce the risk of occupational cancer. benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and organic lead compounds were sampled, and the crew answered a questionnaire on acute health effects. by area monitoring, benzene was generally found to be in the range from the detection limit, of 0.01 ppm, up to 1.15 ppm, but one tanker which loaded gasoline with the hatches open had levels up to 55 ppm. personal monitoring showed exposure levels in the range 0.01-1.15 ppm. the pah-levels and the levels of organic lead were low. no seamen were observed using respiratory protective equipment. central nervous system symptoms were reported by the crew with the highest exposures to benzene although benzene may not be the only cause. the exposure to benzene and other hydrocarbons on the deck of oil product tankers ought to be reduced.
to tune or not to tune: rule evaluation for metaheuristic-based sequential covering algorithms discrete values have important roles in data mining and knowledge discovery. they are about intervals of numbers which are more concise to represent and specify, easier to use and comprehend as they are closer to a knowledge-level representation than continuous values. many studies show induction tasks can benefit from discretization: rules with discrete values are normally shorter and more understandable and discretization can lead to improved predictive accuracy. furthermore, many induction algorithms found in the literature require discrete features. all these prompt researchers and practitioners to discretize continuous features before or during a machine learning or data mining task. there are numerous discretization methods available in the literature. it is time for us to examine these seemingly different methods for discretization and find out how different they really are, what are the key components of a discretization process, how we can improve the current level of research for new development as well as the use of existing methods. this paper aims at a systematic study of discretization methods with their history of development, effect on classification, and trade-off between speed and accuracy. contributions of this paper are an abstract description summarizing existing discretization methods, a hierarchical framework to categorize the existing methods and pave the way for further development, concise discussions of representative discretization methods, extensive experiments and their analysis, and some guidelines as to how to choose a discretization method under various circumstances. we also identify some issues yet to solve and future research for discretization.
shape and structural effects of r5-templated pd nanomaterials as potent catalyst for oxygen electroreduction in alkaline media abstract peptide-capped nanoparticles represent a unique type of nanomaterials with emergent optical and electrochemical properties. herein, a series of peptide capped palladium nanoparticles have been prepared and employed as highly efficient catalysts for oxygen electroreduction. the peptide sequence was tuned by substituting amino acid residues at specialized positions, and strong surface effects were observed between the peptide sequence and the electrocatalytic activity. the findings corresponded well with the previously reported c c coupling catalytic reactions, indicating that the residue-specific binding effects but not the overall binding strength governed the electrocatalytic activity. the results may shed light on the rational design of bio-inspired nanomaterials with optimized electrocatalytic properties.

nano to micro — fluorescence measurements of electric fields in molecules and genetically specified neurons we constructed a novel optical indicator for chloride ions by fusing the chloride-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein with the chloride-insensitive cyan fluorescent protein. the ratio of fret-dependent emission of these fluorophores varied in proportion to the concentration of cl and was used to measure intracellular chloride concentration ([cl-]i) in cultured hippocampal neurons. [cl-]i decreased during neuronal development, consistent with the shift from excitation to inhibition during maturation of gabaergic synapses. focal activation of gabaa receptors caused large changes in [cl-]i that could underlie use-dependent depression of gaba-dependent synaptic transmission. gaba-induced changes in somatic [cl-]i spread into dendrites, suggesting that [cl-]i can signal the location of synaptic activity. this genetically encoded indicator will permit new approaches ranging from high-throughput drug screening to direct recordings of synaptic cl- signals in vivo.

cyber and traditional bullying victimization as a risk factor for mental health problems and suicidal ideation in adolescents abstract. this study was a first attempt to examine the psychometric properties of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq) in dutch youths. a large sample of normal children and adolescents (n = 562) and their parents completed the sdq along with a number of other psychopathology measures. factor analysis of the sdq yielded five factors that were in keeping with the hypothesised subscales of hyperactivity-inattention, emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems, and prosocial behaviour. furthermore, internal consistency, test-retest stability, and parent-youth agreement of the various sdq scales were acceptable. finally, the concurrent validity of the sdq was good: that is, its scores correlated in a theoretically meaningful way with other measures of psychopathology. it can be concluded that the psychometric properties of the parent- and self-report version of the sdq were satisfactory in this dutch community sample. moreover, the current data provide further support for the utility of the sdq as an index of psychopathological symptoms in youths.
estimation of inertial/magnetic sensor orientation for human-motion-capture system this paper considers the question of using a nonlinear complementary filter for attitude estimation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) given only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit. a nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. the raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. the airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full gps/ins that was available for the data set.
genomic analyses of francisella tularensis strains confirm disease transmission from drinking water sources, turkey, 2008, 2009 and 2012. tularemia is an endemic disease in turkey. in this study, we aimed to detect francisella tularensis by two methods from natural water supplies thought to cause tularemia epidemiologically. a total of 154 water specimens from three different outbreaks caused by drinking water were collected. water specimens were cultured on antibiotic-added cysteine heart agar base with blood and incubated at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2 for 4–10 days. the suspected colonies were confirmed by f. tularensis antiserum (bd) and the real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. dna was isolated from samples obtained from filters. the primer and probe sets targeting the isftu2 genome were used. a total of four f. tularensis isolates were obtained from 154 water samples. at the same time, the presence of f. tularensis dna from 17 water specimens was shown by the real-time taqman pcr method. although the dna presence of f. tularensis has been detected from water sources by the pcr method in turkey up to now, there has been no isolation directly from water specimens by culture. in this study, the determination of f. tularensis from water sources has been exhibited as the first data by both culture and real-time taqman pcr methods.
the measurement of information transmitted by a neural population: promises and challenges information theory started and, according to some, ended with shannon’s seminal paper “a mathematical theory of communication” (shannon 1948). because its significance and flexibility were quickly recognized, there were numerous attempts to apply it to diverse fields outside of its original scope. this prompted shannon to write his famous essay “the bandwagon” (shannon 1956), warning against indiscriminate use of the new tool. nevertheless, non-standard applications of information theory persisted.    very soon after shannon’s initial publication (shannon 1948), several manuscripts provided the foundations of much of the current use of information theory in neuroscience. mackay and mcculloch (1952) applied the concept of information to propose limits of the transmission capacity of a nerve cell. this work foreshadowed future work on what can be termed “neural information flow”—how much information moves through the nervous system, and the constraints that information theory imposes on the capabilities of neural systems for communication, computation and behavior. a second set of manuscripts, by attneave (1954) and barlow (1961), discussed information as a constraint on neural system structure and function, proposing that neural structure in sensory system is matched to statistical structure of the sensory environment, in a way to optimize information transmission. this is the main idea behind the “structure from information” line of research that is still very active today. a third thread, “reliable computation with noisy/faulty elements”, started both in the information-theoretic community (shannon and mccarthy 1956) and neuro-science (winograd and cowan 1963). with the advent of integrated circuits that were essentially faultless, interest began to wane. however, as ic technology continues to push towards smaller and faster computational elements (even at the expense of reliability), and as neuromorphic systems are developed with variability designed in (merolla and boahen 2006), this topic is gaining in popularity again in the electronics community, and neuroscientists again may have something to contribute to the discussion.
resistance of differentiated human airway epithelium to infection by rhinovirus. comprehensive and systematic analysis of airway gene expression represents a strategy for addressing the multiple, complex, and largely untested hypotheses that exist for disease mechanisms, including asthma. here, we report a novel real-time pcr-based method specifically designed for quantification of multiple low-abundance transcripts using as little as 2.5 fg of total rna per gene. this method of gene expression profiling has the same specificity and sensitivity as rt-pcr and a throughput level comparable to low-density dna microarray hybridization. in this two-step method, multiplex rt-pcr is successfully combined with individual gene quantification via real-time pcr on generated cdna product. using this method, we measured the expression of 75 genes in bronchial biopsies from asthmatic versus healthy subjects and found expected increases in expression levels of th2 cytokines and their receptors in asthma. surprisingly, we also found increased gene expression of nkcc1--a na+-k+-cl- cotransporter. using immunohistochemical method, we confirmed increased protein expression for nkcc1 in the asthmatic subject with restricted localization to goblet cells. these data validate the new transcriptional profiling method and implicate nkcc1 in the pathophysiology of mucus hypersecretion in asthma. potential applications for this method include transcriptional profiling in limited numbers of laser captured cells and validation of dna microarray data in clinical specimens.
scalable online annotation & object localisation for broadcast media production. images are re-mapped as scale-space trees. the minimal data structure is then augmented by “complement nodes” to increase the practical value of the representation. it is then shown how the resulting ctree can be used to remove noise from images, provide a hierarchical way to estimate a dense disparity map from a stereo pair and to provide a basic segmentation of images for image retrieval purposes.
expression profiling of the rpe in zebrafish smarca4 mutant revealed altered signals that potentially affect rpe and retinal differentiation zebrafish with the young (yng) mutation show a defect in retinal cell differentiation. here we demonstrate that a mutation in a brahma-related gene (brg1) is responsible for the yng phenotype. brahma homologues function as essential subunits for swi/snf-type chromatin remodeling complexes. our analysis indicates that brg1 is required for the wave of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity that precedes retinal cell differentiation. using specific inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway we show this signal has a direct role in retinal cell differentiation. lastly, through investigations of mutants in other chromatin remodeling subunits, we provide genetic evidence for gene and tissue specificity of the brahma chromatin remodeling complex.
identifying key factors of student academic performance by subgroup discovery this paper presents an overview on the vikamine system for subgroup discovery, pattern mining and analytics. as of vikamine version 2, it is implemented as rich-client platform (rcp) application, based on the eclipse framework. this provides for a highly-configurable environment, and allows modular extensions using plugins. we present the system, briefly discuss exemplary plugins, and provide a sketch of successful applications.
sense of coherence and self-sacrificing defense style as predictors of psychological distress and quality of life in rheumatoid arthritis: a 5-year prospective study background the defense style questionnaire (dsq) was designed to assess behavior indicative of conscious derivatives of defensive styles. this study aimed to assess the factor structure and the main psychometric properties of its greek version in 3 different samples.   methods the dsq-88 was translated into greek using back-translation, and it was administered to 2308 participants (984 healthy subjects, 1084 medical patients, and 240 psychiatric patients). exploratory factor analyses were performed; symptom distress checklist-90-r and minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (mmpi) ego strength scales were administered for testing criterion and concurrent validity, followed by hierarchical multiple regression analysis.   results four factors were identified, largely corresponding to the original version's maladaptive, image-distorting, self-sacrificing, and adaptive styles, showing a remarkable stability in all 3 samples. adaptive style was positively correlated to ego strength, whereas maladaptive, image-distorting, and self-sacrificing styles were negatively correlated, in descending order. this, along with the intercorrelations observed between the 4 styles, provides evidence that this version supports the hierarchical organization of defensive functioning. test-retest reliabilities were adequate for all styles (r(1i)'s = 0.88, 0.81, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively). internal consistencies were satisfactory for maladaptive style (0.82), sufficient for self-sacrificing (0.76), and rather low for image-distorting (0.68) and adaptive (0.66) styles. maladaptive, image-distorting, and self-sacrificing-but not adaptive-styles could differentiate nonpatients from psychiatric patients. maladaptive style was positively and adaptive style was negatively independently associated with psychological distress.   conclusions the present findings support the applicability of the greek version of dsq-88 within the greek population. future studies could improve its psychometric properties by finding new items for image-distorting and, especially, adaptive styles.
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three regimens for prevention of malaria: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in ugandan schoolchildren abstract key parasite polymorphisms were assessed in subjects treated for malaria with artesunate-amodiaquine in tororo, uganda. for pfcrt, all of the isolates tested had the cviet haplotype. for pfmdr1, 86y and 1246y were common at baseline and their prevalences were significantly higher in new isolates after therapy, indicating that treatment selected for mutations associated with a decreased response to amodiaquine.
transactions on data hiding and multimedia security x many illegal copies of digital video productions for cinema release can be found on the internet before their official release. during the illegal copying of cinema footage, composite geometric distortions commonly occur due to the angle of the camcorder relative to the screen. we propose a novel video watermarking based on spread spectrum way that satisfies the requirements for protecting digital cinema. it enables the detector to not only extract the embedded message but also estimate the position where the camcorder recording is made. it is sure that the proposed position estimating model (pem) can judge the seat in a theater with a mean absolute error (mae) of (33.84, 9.53, 50.38) cm. experimental results using various types of films show that the presented method provides the mathematical model for detecting and investigating the position of the pirate.
associations among parent acculturation, child bmi, and child fruit and vegetable consumption in a hispanic sample background few studies have examined the influence of country of birth and acculturation status on indicators of obesity using national samples of mexican-american women and men.   methods we analysed data for 1387 mexican-american women and 1404 mexican- american men, ages 25-64, from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-1994). we examined whether waist circumference and abdominal obesity varied by country of birth and acculturation status (primary language spoken), and whether among those with abdominal obesity, number of associated cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factors varied by country of birth and acculturation status.   results both country of birth and, to a lesser degree, acculturation status were significantly associated with waist circumference and abdominal obesity. mexican-born women and men had the smallest waist circumference (90.4 cm, 94.0 cm respectively), us-born english-speaking women and men had intermediate waist circumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and us-born spanish-speaking women and men had the largest waist circumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm), after accounting for age, education, per cent of energy from dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking. all women had high prevalences of abdominal obesity, particularly us-born spanish-speaking women (68.7%). in addition, us-born spanish-speaking women with abdominal obesity were significantly more likely than their counterparts to have one or more of the following cvd risk factors: high serum insulin, non-insulin dependent diabetes, high blood lipids, and/or hypertension.   conclusions these findings illustrate the heterogeneity of the mexican-american population and suggest that country of birth and lack of acculturation to the majority culture, as well as secondary lifestyle changes, may explain the significant clinical differences observed in abdominal obesity within mexican-american population subgroups.
regulation of ventral surface co2/h+‐sensitive neurons by purinergic signalling a long-standing theory posits that central chemoreception, the cns mechanism for co2 detection and regulation of breathing, involves neurons located at the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata (vms). using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we identify vms neurons within the rat retrotrapezoid nucleus (rtn) that have characteristics befitting these elusive chemoreceptors. these glutamatergic neurons are vigorously activated by co2 in vivo, whereas serotonergic neurons are not. their co2 sensitivity is unaffected by pharmacological blockade of the respiratory pattern generator and persists without carotid body input. rtn co2-sensitive neurons have extensive dendrites along the vms and they innervate key pontomedullary respiratory centers. in brainstem slices, a subset of rtn neurons with markedly similar morphology is robustly activated by acidification and co2. their ph sensitivity is intrinsic and involves a background k+ current. in short, the co2-sensitive neurons of the rtn are good candidates for the long sought-after vms chemoreceptors.
heavy chain ferritin acts as an anti‐apoptotic gene that protects livers from ischemia‐reperfusion injury heme oxygenase 1 (ho-1) inhibits apoptosis by regulating cellular prooxidant iron. we now show that there is an additional mechanism by which ho-1 inhibits apoptosis, namely by generating the gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (co). overexpression of ho-1, or induction of ho-1 expression by heme, protects endothelial cells (ecs) from apoptosis. when ho-1 enzymatic activity is blocked by tin protoporphyrin (snppix) or the action of co is inhibited by hemoglobin (hb), ho-1 no longer prevents ec apoptosis while these reagents do not affect the antiapoptotic action of bcl-2. exposure of ecs to exogenous co, under inhibition of ho-1 activity by snppix, substitutes ho-1 in preventing ec apoptosis. the mechanism of action of ho-1/co is dependent on the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling transduction pathway. expression of ho-1 or exposure of ecs to exogenous co enhanced p38 mapk activation by tnf-α. specific inhibition of p38 mapk activation by the pyridinyl imidazol sb203580 or through overexpression of a p38 mapk dominant negative mutant abrogated the antiapoptotic effect of ho-1. taken together, these data demonstrate that the antiapoptotic effect of ho-1 in ecs is mediated by co and more specifically via the activation of p38 mapk by co.
accuracy of magnetic resonance in deeply infiltrating endometriosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis backgroundthere is a lack of consensus regarding the use of quality scores in diagnostic systematic reviews. the objective of this study was to use different methods of weighting items included in a quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (quadas) to produce an overall quality score, and to examine the effects of incorporating these into a systematic review.methodswe developed five schemes for weighting quadas to produce quality scores. we used three methods to investigate the effects of quality scores on test performance. we used a set of 28 studies that assessed the accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux in children.resultsthe different methods of weighting individual items from the same quality assessment tool produced different quality scores. the different scoring schemes ranked different studies in different orders; this was especially evident for the intermediate quality studies. comparing the results of studies stratified as "high" and "low" quality based on quality scores resulted in different conclusions regarding the effects of quality on estimates of diagnostic accuracy depending on the method used to produce the quality score. a similar effect was observed when quality scores were included in meta-regression analysis as continuous variables, although the differences were less apparent.conclusionquality scores should not be incorporated into diagnostic systematic reviews. incorporation of the results of the quality assessment into the systematic review should involve investigation of the association of individual quality items with estimates of diagnostic accuracy, rather than using a combined quality score.
diabetes mellitus and incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies abstract objective: funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. we examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. design: medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the cochrane database of systematic reviews. main outcome measure: degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. results: in the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. in all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. in 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. conclusions: a simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. key messages systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials funnel plots, plots of the trials' effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of reviews from the cochrane database of systematic reviews critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure
conventional radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging for the analysis of trochlear dysplasia: the influence of selected levels on magnetic resonance imaging purpose to establish quantitative and qualitative magnetic resonance (mr) criteria for the diagnosis of trochlear dysplasia.   materials and methods mr images were analyzed in 16 consecutive patients with and 23 without trochlear dysplasia. the standard of reference was a true lateral radiograph of the knee. quantitative and qualitative mr criteria were assessed.   results in patients with trochlear dysplasia, the trochlear groove was significantly less deep than that in control subjects. the most accurate measurement was 3 cm above the femorotibial joint space (p: <.001), where a trochlear depth of 3 mm or less had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. the ventral trochlear prominence between the supratrochlear femoral cortex and the most ventral point of the trochlear floor (midsagittal section) was always larger than 6.9 mm in dysplastic trochleae. a facet ratio of less than 2:5 (medial to lateral) 3 cm above joint space level had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. a nipplelike anterior prominence at the superior end of the femoral trochlea on midsagittal images was a specific (91%) qualitative criterion.   conclusion dysplasia of the femoral trochlea can be diagnosed reliably by using quantitative or qualitative criteria on midsagittal or transverse mr images obtained 3 cm above the femorotibial joint space.
adaptation and evaluation of the neighborhood environment walkability scale in india (news-india) backgroundthe ipen (international physical activity and environment network) adult project seeks to conduct pooled analyses of associations of perceived neighborhood environment, as measured by the neighborhood environment walkability scale (news) and its abbreviated version (news-a), with physical activity using data from 12 countries. as ipen countries used adapted versions of the news/news-a, this paper aimed to develop scoring protocols that maximize cross-country comparability in responses. this information is also highly relevant to non-ipen studies employing the news/news-a, which is one of the most popular measures of perceived environment globally.methodsthe following countries participated in the ipen adult study: australia, belgium, brazil, colombia, czech republic, denmark, hong kong, mexico, new zealand, spain, the united kingdom, and the united states. participants (n = 14,305) were recruited from neighborhoods varying in walkability and socio-economic status. countries collected data on the perceived environment using a self- or interviewer-administered version of the news/news-a. confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) was used to derive comparable country-specific measurement models of the news/news-a. the level of correspondence between standard and alternative versions of the news/news-a factor-analyzable subscales was determined by estimating the correlations and mean standardized difference (cohen’s d) between them using data from countries that had included items from both standard and alternative versions of the subscales.resultsfinal country-specific measurement models of the news/news-a provided acceptable levels of fit to the data and shared the same factorial structure with six latent factors and two single items. the correspondence between the standard and alternative versions of subscales of land use mix – access, infrastructure and safety for walking/cycling, and aesthetics was high. the brazilian version of the traffic safety subscale was highly, while the australian and belgian versions were marginally, comparable to the standard version. single-item versions of the street connectivity subscale used in australia and belgium showed marginally acceptable correspondence to the standard version.conclusionswe have proposed country-specific modifications to the original scoring protocol of the news/news-a that enhance inter-country comparability. these modifications have yielded sufficiently equivalent measurement models of the news/news-a. some inter-country discrepancies remain. these need to be considered when interpreting findings from different countries.
emerging microfluidic tools for functional cellular immunophenotyping: a new potential paradigm for immune status characterization an accurate measurement of the immune status in patients with immune system disorders is critical in evaluating the stage of diseases and tailoring drug treatments. the functional cellular immunity test is a promising method to establish the diagnosis of immune dysfunctions. the conventional functional cellular immunity test involves measurements of the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines when stimulated ex vivo. however, this "bulk" assay measures the overall reactivity of a population of lymphocytes and monocytes, making it difficult to pinpoint the phenotype or real identity of the reactive immune cells involved. in this research, we develop a large surface micromachined poly-dimethylsiloxane (pdms) microfiltration membrane (pmm) with high porosity, which is integrated in a microfluidic microfiltration platform. using the pmm with functionalized microbeads conjugated with antibodies against specific cell surface proteins, we demonstrated rapid, efficient and high-throughput on-chip isolation, enrichment, and stimulation of subpopulations of immune cells from blood specimens. furthermore, the pmm-integrated microfiltration platform, coupled with a no-wash homogeneous chemiluminescence assay ("alphalisa"), enables us to demonstrate rapid and sensitive on-chip immunophenotyping assays for subpopulations of immune cells isolated directly from minute quantities of blood samples.
comparing the biological impact of glatiramer acetate with the biological impact of a generic feature selection techniques have become an apparent need in many bioinformatics applications. in addition to the large pool of techniques that have already been developed in the machine learning and data mining fields, specific applications in bioinformatics have led to a wealth of newly proposed techniques. in this article, we make the interested reader aware of the possibilities of feature selection, providing a basic taxonomy of feature selection techniques, and discussing their use, variety and potential in a number of both common as well as upcoming bioinformatics applications.
differential impact of impaired fasting glucose versus impaired glucose tolerance on cardiometabolic risk factors in multi-ethnic overweight/obese children to evaluate how non-high-density-lipoprotein (non-hdl) is associated with impaired fasting glucose (ifg) and clustered metabolic risk (mr) factors among adolescents, we pooled 2764 adolescents, aged 12-19 years, from the national health and nutrition examination survey from 3 time periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004) who were free of diabetes and had fasted overnight for this analysis. ifg was defined as 100 <or= glucose <or= 125 mg.dl-1. age- and sex-specific cut-offs were used for 4 mr factors: higher levels of triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure, and lower levels of hdl. clustered mr was defined as having any 2 of the 4 factors. overall, approximately 11% of adolescents had ifg. the mean level of non-hdl cholesterol was much higher in those with ifg than in those without ifg, with adjustment for certain confounding variables (121.4 vs. 110.1 mg.dl-1; p < 0.05). this difference could still be observed in adolescents with one or more clustered mr factors. however, there were no statistical differences in low-density-lipoprotein (ldl) level. compared with those who were without ifg and not at high levels of non-hdl - after adjustment for age, sex, race, current smoking, and body mass index - the odds of having clustered mr factors were 1.08 (95% ci, 0.65-1.82) for those with ifg and low non-hdl cholesterol, 3.55 (2.29-5.48) for those without ifg but with high non-hdl cholesterol, and 10.10 (3.67-27.80) for those with both ifg and high non-hdl cholesterol. moreover, those with ifg and at increased risk of obesity were more likely to have higher levels of non-hdl cholesterol (odds ratio (95% ci): 4.41 (2.28-8.50)), compared with those without ifg and not at increased risk of obesity. in summary, prediabetic adolescents with ifg and high levels of non-hdl cholesterol are more likely to have clustered mr factors. thus, the levels of non-hdl cholesterol may be an important indicator in monitoring cardiovascular disease risk among adolescents with ifg.
segmentation schema for enhancing land cover identification: a case study using sentinel 2 data boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. for many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. we show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. for the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. we develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. we suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. this approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. it is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.
arabinogalactan-protein epitope gal4 is differentially regulated and localized in cell lines of hybrid fir (abies alba × abies cephalonica) with different embryogenic and regeneration potential abstract. arabinogalactan-proteins (agps) are a family of extensively glycosylated hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins that are thought to have important roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. after a brief introduction to agps highlighting the problems associated with defining and classifying this diverse family of glycoproteins, agp structure is described in terms of the protein component (including data from molecular cloning), carbohydrate component, processing of agps (including recent data on glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors) and overall molecular shape. next, the expression of agps is examined at several different levels, from the whole plant to the cellular levels, using a variety of experimental techniques and tools. finally, agp function is considered. although the existing functional evidence is not incontrovertible, it does clearly point to roles for agps in vegetative, reproductive, and cellular growth and development as well as programmed cell death and social control. in addition and most likely inextricably linked to their functions, agps are presumably involved in molecular interactions and cellular signaling at the cell surface. some likely scenarios are discussed in this context. agps also have functions of real or potential commercial value, most notably as emulsifiers in the food industry and as potential immunological regulators for human health. several important questions remain to be answered with respect to agps. clearly, elucidating the unequivocal functions of particular agps and relating these functions to their respective structures and modes of action remain as major challenges in the years ahead.
a putative alzheimer's disease risk allele in pck1 influences brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis whole-genome association studies (wgas) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. to address these issues, we developed plink, an open-source c/c++ wgas tool set. with plink, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. as well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, plink also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. we introduce plink and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. in particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. this information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.
a machine-learning approach reveals that alignment properties alone can accurately predict inference of lateral gene transfer from discordant phylogenies. the extent to which lateral genetic transfer has shaped microbial genomes has major implications for the emergence of community structures. we have performed a rigorous phylogenetic analysis of >220,000 proteins from genomes of 144 prokaryotes to determine the contribution of gene sharing to current prokaryotic diversity, and to identify "highways" of sharing between lineages. the inferred relationships suggest a pattern of inheritance that is largely vertical, but with notable exceptions among closely related taxa, and among distantly related organisms that live in similar environments.
extending depth of field by intrinsic mode image fusion this book addresses an area of perception engineering which deals with constructive processes. a model of the environment is analyzed using the information acquired from multiple viewpoints of multiple disparate sensors at multiple time instants. although the role of successive model building and active exploration of the environment, as is discussed in this book, is of great importance, only a few researchers of machine perception have thus far addressed the problem in these directions. krotkov's book, which is a modification and continuation of his highly successful dissertation, focuses on active exploratory sensing in the context of spatial layout perception. he uses stereo and focus to obtain distance by information, and to eventually develop cooperative combining techniques. means of a stereo system with verging cameras, it is demonstrated that the distance measurements can be significantly improved by combining two sources. in addition, the problem of merging information from the multiple views is discussed in detail. as the field of perception engineering seems to be of growing scientific and applied importance, both practitioners and researchers in machine perception will find this book a valuable addition to their libraries. rameshjain series editor acknowledgements i would like to thank professor ruzena bajcsy for her constant encouragement and guidance during the five years of research leading to the dissertation upon which this book is based. without her help in all matters, this work would never have been possible.
biliopancreatic diversion with transient gastroplasty and duodenal switch: long-term results of a multicentric study. the bpd/ds, if properly performed, has the best long-term weight loss of any bariatric operation. it is easy to reverse or revise, has the least marginal ulcers, cures the highest percentage of co-morbidities, has the least failures, and permits normal although smaller meals. it is our opinion that the bpd/ds should be considered as the gold standard bariatric operation.
global transcription profiling reveals multiple sugar signal transduction mechanisms in arabidopsis with the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. it is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. this approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. in doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. the q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.
components of recommended asthma care and the use of long-term control medication among urban children with asthma purpose to examine daily use of antiinflammatory medication among children with asthma in east harlem, where hospitalization rates for asthma are among the highest in the united states.   methods we analyzed parent/guardian reports of medications used by children with current asthma (defined as physician diagnosis and wheezing during the previous 12 months) identified from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2 elementary schools.   results from an overall sample of 1319 children, 298 with current asthma were included in this analysis. most of those with asthma were puerto rican (136 [46%]) or black (98 [33%]), 168 (57%) were boys, and the median age was 8 years old. overall, 65 (22%) were using antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis. a subgroup of 107 children with asthma had been hospitalized during the previous 12 months or had used beta(2)-agonist on a daily basis, suggesting persistent or severe asthma. of these 107 children, 42 (39%) were taking antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis. multivariate analysis of these 107 children revealed that daily use of antiinflammatory medication was associated with using a spacer tube (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 3. 08; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.27,7.47) and having seen a physician in the past 6 months (aor: 3.46; ci: 1.01,11.9). compared with puerto ricans, blacks (aor:.32; ci:.12,.89) or children of other races/ethnicities (aor:.27; ci:.09,.85) were less likely to use antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis.   conclusion daily use of antiinflammatory medication for children with persistent or severe asthma in east harlem was underused. differences in access to care may explain some findings; however, reasons for ethnic differences in use remain unclear. both community interventions and additional provider education are needed.
integrative approach reveals composition of endoparasitoid wasp venoms the interpro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) integrates together predictive models or ‘signatures’ representing protein domains, families and functional sites from multiple, diverse source databases: gene3d, panther, pfam, pirsf, prints, prodom, prosite, smart, superfamily and tigrfams. integration is performed manually and approximately half of the total ∼58 000 signatures available in the source databases belong to an interpro entry. recently, we have started to also display the remaining un-integrated signatures via our web interface. other developments include the provision of non-signature data, such as structural data, in new xml files on our ftp site, as well as the inclusion of matchless uniprotkb proteins in the existing match xml files. the web interface has been extended and now links out to the adan predicted protein–protein interaction database and the spice and dasty viewers. the latest public release (v18.0) covers 79.8% of uniprotkb (v14.1) and consists of 16 549 entries. interpro data may be accessed either via the web address above, via web services, by downloading files by anonymous ftp or by using the interproscan search software (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/interproscan/).
mr to ultrasound registration for image-guided prostate interventions a method is described for generating a patient-specific, statistical motion model (smm) of the prostate gland. finite element analysis (fea) is used to simulate the motion of the gland using an ultrasound-based 3d fe model over a range of plausible boundary conditions and soft-tissue properties. by applying principal component analysis to the displacements of the fe mesh node points inside the gland, the simulated deformations are then used as training data to construct the smm. the smm is used to both predict the displacement field over the whole gland and constrain a deformable surface registration algorithm, given only a small number of target points on the surface of the deformed gland. using 3d transrectal ultrasound images of the prostates of five patients, acquired before and after imposing a physical deformation, to evaluate the accuracy of predicted landmark displacements, the mean target registration error was found to be less than 1.9 mm.
evolutionary toxicogenomics: diversification of the cyp12d1 and cyp12d3 genes in drosophila species the role that natural selection plays in governing the locations and early evolution of copy-number mutations remains largely unexplored. we used high-density full-genome tiling arrays to create a fine-scale genomic map of copy-number polymorphisms (cnps) in drosophila melanogaster. we inferred a total of 2658 independent cnps, 56% of which overlap genes. these include cnps that are likely to be under positive selection, most notably high-frequency duplications encompassing toxin-response genes. the locations and frequencies of cnps are strongly shaped by purifying selection, with deletions under stronger purifying selection than duplications. among duplications, those overlapping exons or introns, as well as those falling on the x chromosome, seem to be subject to stronger purifying selection.
reinduction platform for children with first marrow relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a children's oncology group study[corrected]. the relapse rate in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is approximately 30% but few reinduction regimens have investigated the intensive use of polyethylene glycol escherichia coli asparaginase (peg-asp). therefore, we assessed the pharmocokinetics and efficacy of peg-asp in this setting. children with b-precursor all, in first marrow and/or extramedullary relapse were eligible. reinduction included doxorubicin on day 1, prednisone for 28 days, vincristine weekly for 4 weeks, and peg-asp either weekly or biweekly by randomization. asparaginase levels and antibody to both e coli asparaginase and peg-asp were measured weekly just before each peg-asp dose. overall, 129 of 144 patients (pts) (90%) achieved a complete remission (cr). there was a highly significant difference in cr rates between weekly (69 of 71; 97%) and biweekly (60 of 73; 82%) peg-asp dosing (p =.003). grade 3 or 4 infectious toxicity was common (50%), but only 4 pts died of sepsis during induction. other toxicities were infrequent and hypersensitivity was rare (6 of 144; 4%). low asparaginase levels were associated with high antibody titers to either native (p =.024) or peg asp (p =.0013). the cr rate was significantly associated with higher levels of asparaginase (p =. 012). patients with all in first relapse receiving weekly peg-asp had a higher rate of second remission compared with biweekly dosing. low levels of asparaginase were associated with high antibody titers. increased asparaginase levels may correlate with an improved cr rate. the use of intensive peg-asp should be explored further in the treatment of all.

the submission is for the special topic on large scale learning hash kernels for structured data using extensions of linear algebra concepts to reproducing kernel hilbert spaces (rkhs), we define a unifying framework for random walk kernels on graphs. reduction to a sylvester equation allows us to compute many of these kernels in o(n3) worst-case time. this includes kernels whose previous worst-case time complexity was o(n6), such as the geometric kernels of gartner et al. [1] and the marginal graph kernels of kashima et al. [2]. our algebra in rkhs allow us to exploit sparsity in directed and undirected graphs more effectively than previous methods, yielding sub-cubic computational complexity when combined with conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations. experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that our algorithms are often more than 1000 times faster than existing approaches.
impact of genetic polymorphisms of slc2a2, slc2a5, and khk on metabolic phenotypes in hypertensive individuals the oral or intravenous administration of fructose to children results in dramatic rises in both urate and lactate concentrations in serum and an increase in the excretion of uric acid in the urine, findings interpreted as being caused by rapid nucleic acid degradation due to the increased intracellular lactic acidosis in the liver (perheentupa and raivio, 1967). as lactate also reduces renal excretion of urate (yu, sirota, halpern, and gutman, 1967), these authors were unable to assess the relative importance of hepatic and renal factors in the resultant hyperuricaemia, but the increase in the urinary uric acid suggested either a sudden increase in urate production or a shift of urate from an intracellular pool to the extracellular fluid. moreover, fox and kelley (1972) were unable to demonstrate any consistent decrease in the fractional clearance of urate after fructose infusions. studies in cebus monkeys have also demonstrated hyperuricaemia and increases in urinary uric acid excretion after infusions of high concentrations of hexoses, fructose having the greatest effect and glucose a lesser effect (simkin, 1969). this has not been a uniform finding, however, and no significant changes in serum urate concentrations were demonstrated during the 3 hrs after the intravenous administration of 100 g. fructose to ten young adult males (curreri and pruitt, 1970). because of the conflicting evidence, the lack of information concerning the possible mechanism involved and the potential importance in patients with hyperuricaemia, it was decided to compare the effect of diets containing large quantities of either added fructose or glucose on urate metabolism, as reflected by the miscible urate pool and turnover rate and the simultaneous incorporation of glycine into both urinary and produced uric acid.
effects of repetitive shoulder activity on the subacromial space in manual wheelchair users abstract objective to investigate the reliability of ultrasonographic measurement of acromiohumeral distance (ahd) and the effects of shoulder positioning on ahd among manual wheelchair users (mwus) with spinal cord injury (sci) and an able-bodied control group. methods ten mwus with sci and 10 able-bodied subjects participated in this study. the ultrasonographic measurements of ahd from each subject were obtained by two raters during passive and active scapular plane arm elevation in neutral, 45°, 90° with and without resistance and in a weight relief raise position. the measurements were recorded again by each rater using the same procedures after a 30-minute time interval. all raters were blinded to each other's measurements. setting university laboratories and veteran affairs healthcare system. results intra-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient, icc > 0.83) and inter-rater (icc > 0.78) reliability was excellent for both the mwus with sci and able-bodied groups across all arm positions except for the 45° position in the control group for one of the raters (intra-rater: icc < 0.40 and inter-rater: icc < 0.60). ahd significantly reduced when the shoulder was in the 90° arm elevated positions with or without resistance. conclusion findings from our study demonstrated that ultrasonography is a reliable means to evaluate ahd in both able bodied and individuals with sci, who are known to have significant shoulder pathology. this technique could be used to develop reference measures and to identify changes in ahd caused by interventions.
intraindividual variability in domain-specific cognition and risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia context some studies of hormone treatment in postmenopausal women suggest benefits on specific cognitive functions, particularly memory.   objective the objective of this study was to determine whether hormone therapy influences changes in specific cognitive functions and affect in older women.   design this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.   setting participants were women from 14 of 40 clinical centers of the women's health initiative (whi).   participants postmenopausal women (1416) aged 65 yr and older, free of probable dementia, and enrolled in whi and the whi memory study (whims) trial of combination estrogen and progestin for a mean of 3 yr and followed for a mean of 1.35 yr, were studied.   intervention intervention was conjugated equine estrogen (cee; 0.625 mg) with 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (mpa) in one daily tablet (cee + mpa) or placebo.   main outcome measures annual rates of change in specific cognitive functions and affect, adjusted for time since randomization, were measured.   results cee + mpa had a negative impact on verbal memory (p <or= 0.01) and a trend to a positive impact on figural memory (p = 0.012) over time compared with placebo, but other cognitive domains were not affected. both effects on memory were evident only after long-term therapy. cee + mpa did not significantly influence positive affect, negative affect, or depressive symptoms.   conclusions the effect of cee + mpa on cognitive function varies across cognitive domains in older women, reflecting both possible beneficial and detrimental actions of ovarian steroids on the aging brain. our results extend prior findings about dementia and global cognitive function to age-related changes in specific cognitive functions and suggest directions for future research.
an integrative model of motor unit activity during sustained submaximal contractions. aim to test the hypothesis that time-wise increase in intramuscular pressure (imp) and subsequent decrease in muscle tissue oxygenation (to(2)) results in muscle fatigue development during a non-exhaustive, low-force contraction evidenced by changes in electromyogram (emg) and particular mechanomyogram (mmg).   methods seven subjects performed static elbow flexion at 10% maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) for 10 min (10% mvc(10 min)). surface emg, mmg, imp and to(2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy was recorded from m. biceps brachii during 10% mvc(10 min) and during 5% mvc test contractions of 1 min duration performed before 10% mvc(10 min), 10 and 30 min post-exercise. emg and mmg were analysed for root mean square (rms) and mean power frequency (mpf).   results during 10% mvc(10 min) mmgrms increased from initial level of 0.04 +/- 0.01 to 0.11 +/- 0.07 m s(-2) in the last minute and mmgmpf and emgmpf decreased from 34.9 +/- 8.2 to 21.3 +/- 3.8 hz and from 71.7 +/- 10.9 to 61.7 +/- 10.0 hz respectively. similar changes were present in 5% mvc test contractions 30 min post-exercise. initially, to(2) decreased by 6.9 +/- 6.5% of resting level but returned to rest within 1 min. imp remained constant during the contraction after an initial fourfold increase from resting level of 12.2 +/- 10.4 mmhg.   conclusions imp was anticipated to increase with time of contraction due to e.g. increased muscle water content; but this was not confirmed. consequently, muscle blood flow was unlikely to be impeded with contraction time, which may account for the maintenance of to(2). thus, decreased to(2) did not underlie either acute or long-term muscle fatigue development evidenced by changes in emg and particular mmg variables.
pre-restorative crown lengthening surgery outcomes: a systematic review. surgical crown lengthening has been proposed as a means of facilitating restorative procedures and preventing injuries in teeth with structurally inadequate clinical crown or exposing tooth structure in the presence of deep, subgingival pathologies which may hamper the access for proper restorative measures. histological studies utilizing animal models have shown that postoperative crestal resorption allowed reestablishment of the biologic width. however, very little has been done in humans. aims. the purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential changes in the periodontal tissues, particularly the biologic width, following surgical crown lengthening by two surgical procedures before and after crown placement. methods and material. twenty (20) patients who needed surgical crown lengthening to gain retention necessary for prosthetic treatment and/or to access caries, tooth fracture, or previous prosthetic margins entered the study. the following parameters were obtained from line angles of treated teeth (teeth requiring surgical crown lengthening) and adjacent sites: plaque and gingival indices (pi) & (gi), position of gingival margin from reference stent (pgmrs), probing depth (pd), and biologic width (bw). statistical analysis used. student “t” test. results. initial baseline values of biologic width were 2.55 mm (gingivectomy procedure b1 group) and 1.95 mm (ostectomy procedure b2 group) and after surgical procedure the values were 1.15 mm and 1.25 mm. conclusions. within the limitations of the study the biologic width, at treated sites, was re-established to its original vertical dimension by 3 months. ostectomy with apically positioned flap can be considered as a more effective procedure than gingivectomy for surgical crown lengthening.
systematic review, network meta-analysis and economic evaluation of biological therapy for the management of active psoriatic arthritis indirect and mixed treatment comparison (mtc) approaches to synthesis are logical extensions of more established meta-analysis methods. they have great potential for estimating the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatments using an evidence base of trials that individually do not compare all treatment options. connected networks of evidence can be synthesized simultaneously to provide estimates of the comparative effectiveness of all included treatments and a ranking of their effectiveness with associated probability statements.the potential of the use of indirect and mtc methods in technology assessment is considerable, and would allow for a more consistent assessment than simpler alternative approaches. although such models can be viewed as a logical and coherent extension of standard pair-wise meta-analysis, their increased complexity raises some unique issues with far-reaching implications concerning how we use data in technology assessment, while simultaneously raising searching questions about standard pair-wise meta-analysis. this article reviews pair-wise meta-analysis and indirect and mtc approaches to synthesis, clearly outlining the assumptions involved in each approach. it also raises the issues that the national institute for health and clinical excellence (nice) needed to consider in updating their 2004 guide to the methods of technology appraisal, if such methods are to be used in their technology appraisals.
team preceptorship model: a solution for students' clinical experience content analysis is a widely used qualitative research technique. rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. all three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. the major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. in conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. with a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. a summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. the authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.
valve-related hemodynamics mediate human bicuspid aortopathy: insights from wall shear stress mapping. to evaluate an improved image acquisition and data‐processing strategy for assessing aortic vascular geometry and 3d blood flow at 3t.
minireviews s 1 p signaling and de novo biosynthesis in blood pressure homeostasis sphingosine kinase 1 (sphk1) and sphk2 are ubiquitous enzymes that generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p), a ligand for a family of g protein-coupled receptors (s1pr1-s1pr5) with important functions in the vascular and immune systems. here we explore the role of these kinases and receptors in recovery from anaphylaxis in mice. we found that sphk2-/- mice had a rapid recovery from anaphylaxis. in contrast, sphk1-/- mice showed poor recovery from anaphylaxis and delayed histamine clearance. injection of s1p into sphk1-/- mice increased histamine clearance and promoted recovery from anaphylaxis. adoptive cell transfer experiments demonstrated that sphk1 activity was required in both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments for recovery from anaphylaxis. mice lacking the s1p receptor s1pr2 also showed a delay in plasma histamine clearance and a poor recovery from anaphylaxis. however, s1p did not promote the recovery of s1pr2-/- mice from anaphylaxis, whereas s1pr2+/- mice showed partial recovery. unlike sphk2-/- mice, sphk1-/- and s1pr2-/- mice had severe hypotension during anaphylaxis. thus, sphk1-produced s1p regulates blood pressure, histamine clearance, and recovery from anaphylaxis in a manner that involves s1pr2. this suggests that specific s1pr2 agonists may serve to counteract the vasodilation associated with anaphylactic shock.
protection of retinal ganglion cells from natural and axotomy-induced cell death in neonatal transgenic mice overexpressing bcl-2 the patterns of cell death and division are described in the normal postnatal rat retina and following transection of the optic nerve on the day of birth. optic nerve transection on the day of birth results in the rapid degeneration of the ganglion cells. mitosis at the outer retinal surface ceases first in the temporal retina, then in the nasal retina and becomes progressively more restricted to peripheral regions. mitotic activity was not affected by the loss of ganglion cells. cell death takes place in a wave passing from the ganglion cell to the inner nuclear to the outer nuclear layer. the time course of cell death is not affected by the loss of ganglion cells following optic nerve transection, and there is no significant increase in the number of cells which degenerate in the inner nuclear layer. the effects of removing a major postsynaptic target of local circuit neurones appears to be less pronounced than has been reported for relay neurones.
diabetes reduces mesenchymal stem cells in fracture healing through a tnfα-mediated mechanism chemokines are thought to play an important role in several aspects of bone metabolism including the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of osteoclasts. we investigated the impact of diabetes on chemokine expression in normal and diabetic fracture healing. fracture of the femur was performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic and matched normoglycemic control mice. microarray analysis was carried out and chemokine mrna levels in vivo were assessed. ccl4 were examined in fracture calluses by immunohistochemistry and the role of tnf in diabetes-enhanced expression was investigated by treatment of animals with the tnf-specific inhibitor, pegsunercept. in vitro studies were conducted with atdc5 chondrocytes. diabetes significantly upregulated mrna levels of several chemokines in vivo including ccl4, ccl8, ccl6, ccl11, ccl20, ccl24, cxcl2, cxcl5 and chemokine receptors ccr5 and cxcr4. chondrocytes were identified as a significant source of ccl4 and its expression in diabetic fractures was dependent on tnf (p<0.05). tnf-α significantly increased mrna levels of several chemokines in vitro which were knocked down with foxo1 sirna (p<0.05). ccl4 expression at the mrna and proteins levels was induced by foxo1 over-expression and reduced by foxo1 knockdown. the current studies point to the importance of tnf-α as a mechanism for diabetes enhanced chemokine expression by chondrocytes, which may contribute to the accelerated loss of cartilage observed in diabetic fracture healing. moreover, in vitro results point to foxo1 as a potentially important transcription factor in mediating this effect.
regulatory snapshots: integrative mining of regulatory modules from expression time series and regulatory networks a large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. however, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. this limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. a similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. for this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. the goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. in this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. in this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.
aspects of sound localization and spatial attention in barn owls and rats the topographical relations of the visual field with the superior colliculus of the rat was investigated using constant small visual stimuli and recording the electrical response of aggregate unit activity with fine tip metal microelectrodes. a precise essentially linear projection onto the contralateral colliculus was demonstrated after appropriate corrections for brain curvature were performed. the general pattern and arrangement of the retinotopic projection is similar to that found in infra‐mammalian vertebrates. an ipsilateral projection appears to be absent. the phasic properties and rhythmic discharge patterns of single units in the coliculus were studied with stationary and moving luminous stimuli.
oxygen cost of exercise hyperpnoea is greater in women compared with men the oxygen cost of exercise hyperpnea (v˙(o2 rm)) has been quantified using a variety of techniques with inconsistent findings. between-study variation relates to poor control of breathing patterns and lung mechanics. we developed a methodology allowing precise matching of exercising wob in order to estimate v˙(o2 rm). thirteen healthy young subjects (7 male) completed an incremental cycle exercise test, familiarization and experimental days where exercise hyperpnea was mimicked. on experimental days, feedback of exercise flow, volume and the respiratory pressures were provided while end-tidal co2 was kept at exercise levels during each 5-min trial. minute ventilation levels between 50 and 100% maximum were mimicked 3-5 times. the r(2) between exercise and mimic trails was 0.99 for frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation; 0.86 for esophageal pressure swings and 0.93 for wob. the coefficient of variation for (v˙(o2) averaged 4.3, 4.4 and 5.7% for 50, 75 and 100% ventilation trials. when wob and other respiratory parameters are tightly controlled, the v˙(o2 rm) can be consistently estimated.
pattern recognition we present a fast line segment tracker which does not require any knowledge about the motion of the camera nor the structure of the observed scene. it runs on 320 times 240 pixel images at 30 hz. we adapted the rapid tracker with a new way of handling multiple line hypotheses to deal with the simple model of a single line segment. we discuss the difficulty of using a chi2-test as merging criterion and also present a new approach to overcome it. furthermore, instead of making assumptions about the camera motion, a constant velocity motion model to predict the line segment position in the following frame is used. we explain how to deal with the instability of the endpoint extraction in this motion model to avoid unintentional motion along the line. finally, we present results on real world indoor and urban outdoor image sequences.
the nature of lexical-semantic access in bilingual aphasia purpose the effect of semantic naming treatment on crosslinguistic generalization was investigated in 3 participants with english-spanish bilingual aphasia.   method a single-subject experimental designed was used. participants received semantic treatment to improve naming of english or spanish items, while generalization was tested to untrained semantically related items in the trained language and translations of the trained and untrained items in the untrained language.   results results demonstrated a within- and across-languages effect on generalization related to premorbid language proficiencies. participant 1 (p1; equal premorbid proficiency across languages) showed within-language generalization in the trained language (spanish) as well as crosslinguistic generalization to the untrained language (english). participant 2 (p2) and participant (p3) were more proficient premorbidly in english. with treatment in english, p2 showed within-language generalization to semantically related items, but no crosslinguistic generalization. with treatment in spanish, both p2 and p3 exhibited no within-language generalization, but crosslinguistic generalization to english (dominant language) occurred. error analyses indicated an evolution of errors as a consequence of treatment.   conclusions these results are preliminary because all participants were not treated in both languages. however, the results suggest that training the less dominant language may be more beneficial in facilitating crosslinguistic generalization than training the more proficient language in an unbalanced bilingual individual.
flow sensing in developing xenopus laevis is disrupted by visual cues and ototoxin exposure hair cells of the lateral line system in fish may differ in their susceptibility to damage by aminoglycoside antibiotics. gentamicin has been reported to damage hair cells within canal neuromasts, but not those within superficial neuromasts. this finding, based on sem imaging, indicates a distinction in the physiology of hair cells between the two classes of neuromast. studies concerned with the individual roles of canal and superficial neuromasts in behavior have taken advantage of this effect in an attempt to selectively disable canal neuromasts without affecting superficial neuromast function. here we present an experimental test of the hypothesis that canal neuromasts are more vulnerable to gentamicin than superficial neuromasts. we measured the effect of gentamicin exposure on hair cells using vital stains (daspei and fm1-43) in the neuromasts of mexican blind cave fish (astyanaxfasciatus) and zebrafish (daniorerio). contrary to the findings of prior studies that used sem, gentamicin significantly reduced dye uptake by hair cells of both canal and superficial neuromasts in both species. therefore, lateral line hair cells of both neuromast types are vulnerable to gentamicin ototoxicity. these findings argue for a re-evaluation of the results of studies that have used gentamicin to differentiate the roles of the two classes of neuromast in fish behavior.
unannounced telephone-based pill counts: a valid and feasible method for monitoring adherence objectives many questionnaires on adherence to antiretroviral therapy are in use, but the validity of patients’ responses has not been tested. the medication adherence self-report inventory (masri) has been developed and tested for its validity against objective measures and treatment outcome. design prospective study comparing questionnaire responses with mems trackcap (mc, a medication event monitoring system), pill count (pc) and plasma hiv viraemia in a publicly funded specialist hiv clinic. participants patients self-medicating antiretroviral therapy who were not cognitively impaired and were able to read and understand english. results mean adherence by mc of the 78 subjects was 92.9% (se, 1.8%) and by pc 96.8% (se, 1.4%). agreement between mc and responses to items about doses missed 1, 2 or 3 days ago was low (κ = 0.23 (p < 0.03), 0.44 (p < 0.001) and 0.28 (p < 0.01) respectively). this improved when these responses were summated (κ = 0.46;p < 0.001) and was similar to that for recall of non-adherence over the preceding 2 weeks (κ = 0.54;p < 0.001). mean self-reported adherence by visual analogue scale (vas) over the preceding month was 93.3% (se, 1.2%). this was strongly associated with both mc (r = 0.63;p < 0.001) and pc (r = 0.75;p < 0.001). on multivariate analysis, the strongest association between a masri item and mc was for the vas. both the 2 week recall and vas items were inversely associated with viral load (p = 0.01). there was no association between dose timing (measured mc or questionnaire) or 3 day self-report and viral load. conclusions the masri provides a means of measuring patient adherence that is valid when compared with objective measures.
climbing time to exhaustion is a determinant of climbing performance in high-level sport climbers objectives to assess oxygen uptake (vo2), blood lactate concentration ([la(b)]), and heart rate (hr) response during indoor and outdoor sport climbing.   methods seven climbers aged 25 (se 1) years, with a personal best ascent without preview or fall (on sight) ranging from 6b to 7a were assessed using an indoor vertical treadmill with artificial rock hand/foot holds and a discontinuous protocol with climbing velocity incremented until voluntary fatigue. on a separate occasion the subjects performed a 23.4 m outdoor rock climb graded 5c and taking 7 min 36 s (se 33 s) to complete. cardiorespiratory parameters were measured using a telemetry system and [la(b)] collected at rest and after climbing.   results indoor climbing elicited a peak oxygen uptake (vo2climb-peak) and peak hr (hrpeak) of 43.8 (se 2.2) ml/kg/min and 190 (se 4) bpm, respectively and increased blood lactate concentration [la(b)] from 1.4 (0.1) to 10.2 (0.6) mmol/l (p < 0.05). during outdoor climbing vo2 and hr increased to about 75% and 83% of vo2climb-peak and hrpeak, respectively. [la(b)] increased from 1.3 (0.1) at rest to 4.5 mmol/l (p < 0.05) at 2 min 32 s (8 s) after completion of the climb.   conclusions the results suggest that for elite climbers outdoor sport rock climbs of five to 10 minutes' duration and moderate difficulty require a significant portion of the vo2climb-peak. the higher hr and vo2 for outdoor climbing and the increased [la(b)] could be the result of repeated isometric contractions, particularly from the arm and forearm muscles.
the interaction of deworming, improved sanitation, and household flooring with soil-transmitted helminth infection in rural bangladesh abstract in this tutorial, we provide a broad introduction to the topic of interaction between the effects of exposures. we discuss interaction on both additive and multiplicative scales using risks, and we discuss their relation to statistical models (e.g. linear, log-linear, and logistic models). we discuss and evaluate arguments that have been made for using additive or multiplicative scales to assess interaction. we further discuss approaches to presenting interaction analyses, different mechanistic forms of interaction, when interaction is robust to unmeasured confounding, interaction for continuous outcomes, qualitative or “crossover” interactions, methods for attributing effects to interactions, case-only estimators of interaction, and power and sample size calculations for additive and multiplicative interaction.

speaker identification using empirical mode decomposition-based voice activity detection algorithm under realistic conditions • speech conveys several levels of information. on a primary level, speech conveys the words or message being spoken, but on a secondary level, speech also reveals information about the speaker. the speech systems technology group at lincoln laboratory has developed and experimented with approaches for automatically recognizing the words being spoken, the language being spoken, and the topic of a conversation. in this article we present an overview of our research efforts in a fourth area-automatic speaker recognition. we base our approach on a statistical speaker-modeling technique that represents the underlying characteristic sounds of a person's voice. using these models, we build speaker recognizers that are computationally inexpensive and capable of recognizing a speaker regardless ofwhat is being said. performance of the systems is evaluated for a wide range of speech quality; from clean speech to telephone speech, by using several standard speech corpora.
a "natural experiment" in childrearing ecologies and adolescents' attachment and separation representations. this meta-analysis on 33 studies, including more than 2,000 adult attachment interview (aai) classifications, presents distributions of aai classifications in samples of nonclinical fathers and mothers, in adolescents, in samples from different cultures, and in clinical groups. fathers, adolescents, and participants from different countries show about the same distribution of aai classifications as nonclinical mothers do. the distribution of nonclinical mothers is as follows: 24% dismissing, 58% autonomous, and 18% preoccupied mothers. about 19% of the nonclinical mothers are unresolved with respect to loss or trauma of other kinds. mothers from low socioeconomic status show more often dismissing attachment representations and unresolved loss or trauma. autonomous women and autonomous men are more often married to each other than can be expected by chance, and the same goes for unresolved men and women. clinical participants show highly deviating distributions of aai classifications, with a strong overrepresentation of insecure attachment representations, but systematic relations between clinical diagnosis and type of insecurity are absent.
knowledge integration for improving performance in lvcsr most statistical speech recognition systems make use of segment-level features, derived mainly from spectral envelope characteristics of the signal, but ignore supra-segmental cues that carry additional information likely to be useful for speech recognition. these cues, which constitute the prosody of the utterance and occur at the syllable, word and utterance level, are closely related to the lexical and syntactic organization of the utterance. in this paper, we explore the use of acoustic and lexical correlates of a subset of these cues in order to improve recognition performance on a read-speech corpus, using word error rate (wer) as the metric. using the features and methods described in this paper, we were able to obtain a relative wer improvement of 1.3% over a baseline asr system on the boston university radio news corpus.
stable simulation of fluid flow with high-reynolds number using ehrenfests’ steps the entropy maximum approach to constructing equilibria in lattice kinetic equations is revisited. for a suitable entropy function, we derive explicitly the hydrodynamic local equilibrium, prove the $h$ theorem for lattice bhatnagar-gross-krook models, and develop a systematic method to account for additional constraints.
sequence prediction with neural segmental models we describe the design of kaldi, a free, open-source toolkit for speech recognition research. kaldi provides a speech recognition system based on finite-state automata (using the freely available openfst), together with detailed documentation and a comprehensive set of scripts for building complete recognition systems. kaldi is written is c++, and the core library supports modeling of arbitrary phonetic-context sizes, acoustic modeling with subspace gaussian mixture models (sgmm) as well as standard gaussian mixture models, together with all commonly used linear and affine transforms. kaldi is released under the apache license v2.0, which is highly nonrestrictive, making it suitable for a wide community of users.
fatty acid translocase/cd36 mediates the uptake of palmitate by type ii pneumocytes. nucleic acid probes are an important tool in molecular diagnosis. to facilitate the detection of hybridized probes, they are labeled with a reporter molecule, which is usually a radioisotope. for diagnostic techniques carried out in a clinical laboratory, radioisotopes are hazardous and, thus, recently there is a move to use nonisotopic labels, such as biotin and digoxigenin. nonisotopic probes also have the advantage of much better stability over time compared with isotopic probes that have limited half-lives.
increased chemosensitivity and elevated reactive oxygen species are mediated by glutathione reduction in glutamine deprived neuroblastoma cells the microtiter plate technique reported by baker and colleagues for the glutathione reductase-dtnb recycling assay of total glutathione (gsx) and glutathione disulfide (gssg) has been modified according to anderson's recommendations, in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of this miniaturized method for the measurement of glutathione status in cultured/isolated cells. dilute hcl (10 mmol/l) has been used to lyse cells, before protein removal by centrifugation in the presence of 1.3% sulfosalicylic acid. the final dtnb, gssg-reductase and nadph concentrations in the reaction mixture have been increased to 0.7 mmol/l, 1.2 iu/ml and 0.24 mmol/l, respectively. the procedure specificity has been tested by spiking and dilution assays, showing that about 90% of the expected gsx amounts could actually be recovered, while no changes of gssg concentrations were caused in the cells. accuracy has been assessed by analysis of within-series precision as well as of intra- and interassay reproducibility, showing coefficient variation of <10%. glutathione changes measured either in control rat hepatocytes or in primary cultures treated with paracetamol or menadione were in good agreement with well-known literature data. these data suggest that the experimental conditions reported in this paper are suitable for the analysis of total glutathione and glutathione disulfide concentrations in cultured/isolated cells.
scheduling workflows with budget workflow management is emerging as an important service in grid computing. a simple model that can be used for the representation of certain workflows is a directed acyclic graph. although many heuristics have been proposed to schedule such graphs on heterogeneous environments, most of them assume accurate prediction of computation and communication costs. this limits their direct applicability to a dynamically changing environment, such as the grid. in this environment, an initial schedule may be built based on estimates, but run-time rescheduling may be needed to improve application performance. this paper presents a low-cost rescheduling policy, which considers rescheduling at a few, carefully selected points during the execution. this policy achieves performance results, which are comparable with those achieved by a policy that dynamically attempts to reschedule before the execution of every task.
changes in clinical trials methodology over time recently, paradigm shift from expert opinion towards evidence-based medicine has occurred encouraging physicians to base their treatment decisions on the best available research evidence. in the hierarchy of evidence randomized clinical trials (level 1 evidence) are considered of the highest quality (least biased) while non-randomized studies represent lower levels (levels 2–4). several pitfalls in the design and conduct of clinical research include: lack of randomization, lack of concealment, lack of blinding, and errors in hypothesis testing (type i and ii errors). a basic understanding of these principles of research will empower both investigators and readers when applying the results of research to clinical practice.
structural, biochemical, and cell biological characterization of rab7 mutants that cause peripheral neuropathy prenylated rab gtpases occur in the cytosol in their gdp‐bound conformations bound to a cytosolic protein termed gdp‐dissociation inhibitor (gdi). rab–gdi complexes represent a pool of active, recycling rab proteins that can deliver rabs to specific and distinct membrane‐bound compartments. rab delivery to cellular membranes involves release of gdi, and the membrane‐associated rab protein then exchanges its bound gdp for gtp. we report here the identification of a novel, membrane‐associated protein factor that can release prenylated rab proteins from gdi. this gdi‐displacement factor (gdf) is not a guanine nucleotide exchange factor because it did not influence the intrinsic rates of nucleotide exchange by rabs 5, 7 or 9. rather, gdf caused the release of each of these endosomal rabs from gdi, permitting them to exchange nucleotide at their intrinsic rates. gdf displayed the greatest catalytic rate enhancement on rab9–gdi complexes. however, catalytic rate enhancement paralleled the potency of gdi in blocking nucleotide exchange: gdi was shown to be most potent in blocking nucleotide exchange by rab9. the failure of gdf to act on rab1–gdi complexes suggests that it may be specific for endosomal rab proteins. this novel, membrane‐associated activity may be part of the machinery used to localize rabs to their correct intracellular compartments.
chapter 9 action recognition in realistic sports videos deformable part models have achieved impressive performance for object detection, even on difficult image datasets. this paper explores the generalization of deformable part models from 2d images to 3d spatiotemporal volumes to better study their effectiveness for action detection in video. actions are treated as spatiotemporal patterns and a deformable part model is generated for each action from a collection of examples. for each action model, the most discriminative 3d sub volumes are automatically selected as parts and the spatiotemporal relations between their locations are learned. by focusing on the most distinctive parts of each action, our models adapt to intra-class variation and show robustness to clutter. extensive experiments on several video datasets demonstrate the strength of spatiotemporal dpms for classifying and localizing actions.
genetic screen of african americans with fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy fuchs corneal dystrophy (fcd) is a degenerative genetic disorder of the corneal endothelium that represents one of the most common causes of corneal transplantation in the united states. despite its high prevalence (4% over the age of 40), the underlying genetic basis of fcd is largely unknown. here we report missense mutations in tcf8, a transcription factor whose haploinsufficiency causes posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (ppcd), in a cohort of late-onset fcd patients. in contrast to ppcd-causing mutations, all of which are null, fcd-associated mutations encode rare missense changes suggested to cause loss of function by an in vivo complementation assay. importantly, segregation of a recurring p.q840p mutation in a large, multigenerational fcd pedigree showed this allele to be sufficient but not necessary for pathogenesis. execution of a genome-wide scan conditioned for the presence of the 840p allele identified an additional late-onset fcd locus on chromosome 9p, whereas haplotype analysis indicated that the presence of the tcf8 allele and the disease haplotype on 9p leads to a severe fcd manifestation with poor prognosis. our data suggest that ppcd and fcd are allelic variants of the same disease continuum and that genetic interaction between genes that cause corneal dystrophies can modulate the expressivity of the phenotype.
deep feature fusion network for answer quality prediction in community question answering we describe semeval–2017 task 3 on community question answering. this year, we reran the four subtasks from semeval-2016: (a) question–comment similarity, (b) question–question similarity, (c) question–external comment similarity, and (d) rerank the correct answers for a new question in arabic, providing all the data from 2015 and 2016 for training, and fresh data for testing. additionally, we added a new subtask e in order to enable experimentation with multi-domain question duplicate detection in a larger-scale scenario, using stackexchange subforums. a total of 23 teams participated in the task, and submitted a total of 85 runs (36 primary and 49 contrastive) for subtasks a–d. unfortunately, no teams participated in subtask e. a variety of approaches and features were used by the participating systems to address the different subtasks. the best systems achieved an official score (map) of 88.43, 47.22, 15.46, and 61.16 in subtasks a, b, c, and d, respectively. these scores are better than the baselines, especially for subtasks a–c.
recognizing complex events in videos by learning key static-dynamic evidences this paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. while previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. this makes them difficult and expensive to apply. the goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. taking a support vector machine (svm) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. from a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. the theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. it shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.
reduced incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in walkers and runners we provide an updated version of the compendium of physical activities, a coding scheme that classifies specific physical activity (pa) by rate of energy expenditure. it was developed to enhance the comparability of results across studies using self-reports of pa. the compendium coding scheme links a five-digit code that describes physical activities by major headings (e.g., occupation, transportation, etc.) and specific activities within each major heading with its intensity, defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate (met). energy expenditure in met-minutes, met-hours, kcal, or kcal per kilogram body weight can be estimated for specific activities by type or met intensity. additions to the compendium were obtained from studies describing daily pa patterns of adults and studies measuring the energy cost of specific physical activities in field settings. the updated version includes two new major headings of volunteer and religious activities, extends the number of specific activities from 477 to 605, and provides updated met intensity levels for selected activities.
computational logics and agents: a road map of current technologies and future trends this paper presents an argumentation based framework to support the decision making of an agent within a modular architecture for agents. the proposed argumentation framework is dynamic, with arguments and their strength depending on the particular context that the agent finds himself, thus allowing the agent to adapt his decisions in a changing environment. in addition, in order to enable the agent to operate within an open environment where the available information may be incomplete we have integrated abduction within this argumentation framework. this is particular useful when the agent finds himself in a dilemma and hence needs additional information to resolve this. we have also developed, motivated by work in cognitive psychology, within the same framework an argumentation based personality theory for agents thus incorporating a dimension of individuality in the decisions of the agent.
the role of social actors in the sustainability of e-government implementation and use: experience from indonesian regencies the problem and the solution. this chapter overviews case study research and proposes a manner in which case study research can contribute to theory building in applied disciplines. although theory building using case study research has been discussed previously in the literature, there is no clarity as to how case study research can be used to build theory. moreover, it should not be assumed that there is clarity on the processes of case writing, case studies, or case study research. this chapter presents definitions, purposes, and elements of case study research for the purpose of understanding how case study research can be used to build theory in applied disciplines.
researching multilingually: new theoretical and methodological directions thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. in this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. we outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. we then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. we conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.
iaa–amido synthetase activity and gh3 expression during development of pea seedlings auxins are hormones involved in many cellular, physiological and developmental processes in seed plants and in mosses such as physcomitrella patens. control of auxin levels is achieved in higher plants via synthesis of auxin conjugates by members of the gh3 family. the role of the two gh3-like proteins from p. patens for growth and auxin homeostasis was therefore analysed. the in vivo-function of the two p. patens gh3 genes was investigated using single and double knockout mutants. the two p. patens gh3 proteins were also heterologously expressed to determine their enzymatic activity. both p. patens gh3 enzymes accepted the auxin indole acetic acid (iaa) as substrate, but with different preferences for the amino acid to which it is attached. cytoplasmic localization was shown for ppgh3-1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (gfp). targeted knock-out of either gene exhibited an increased sensitivity to auxin, resulting in growth inhibition. on plain mineral media mutants had higher levels of free iaa and less conjugated iaa than the wild type, and this effect was enhanced when auxin was supplied. the deltappgh3-1/deltappgh3-2 double knockout had almost no iaa amide conjugates but still synthesized ester conjugates. taken together, these data suggest a developmentally controlled involvement of p. patens gh3 proteins in auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess of physiologically active free auxin to inactive iaa-amide conjugates.
robustness of treatment planning for electrochemotherapy of deep-seated tumors irreversible electroporation (ire) is a new tissue ablation technique in which micro to millisecond electrical pulses are delivered to undesirable tissue to produce cell necrosis through irreversible cell membrane permeabilization. ire affects only the cell membrane and no other structure in the tissue. the goal of the study is to test our ire tissue ablation methodology in the pig liver, provide first experience results on long term histopathology of ire ablated tissue, and discuss the clinical implications of the findings. the study consists of: a) designing an ire ablation protocol through a mathematical analysis of the electrical field during electroporation; b) using ultrasound to position the electroporation electrodes in the predetermined locations and subsequently to monitor the process; c) applying the predetermined electrotroporation pulses; d) performing histolopathology on the treated samples for up to two weeks after the procedure; and e) correlating the mathematical analysis, ultrasound data, and histology. we observed that electroporation affects tissue in a way that can be imaged in real time with ultrasound, which should facilitate real time control of electroporation during clinical applications. we observed cell ablation to the margin of the treated lesion with several cells thickness resolution. there appears to be complete ablation to the margin of blood vessels without compromising the functionality of the blood vessels, which suggests that ire is a promising method for treatment of tumors near blood vessels (a significant challenge with current ablation methods). consistent with the mechanism of action of ire on the cell membrane only, we show that the structure of bile ducts, blood vessels, and connective tissues remains intact with ire. we report extremely rapid resolution of lesions, within two weeks, which is consistent with retention of vasculature. we also document tentative evidence for an immunological response to the ablated tissue. last, we show that mathematical predictions with the laplace equation can be used in treatment planning. the ire tissue ablation technique, as characterized in this report, may become an important new tool in the surgeon armamentarium.
facial expression recognition and expression intensity estimation within the past decade, significant effort has occurred in developing methods of facial expression analysis. because most investigators have used relatively limited data sets, the generalizability of these various methods remains unknown. we describe the problem space for facial expression analysis, which includes level of description, transitions among expressions, eliciting conditions, reliability and validity of training and test data, individual differences in subjects, head orientation and scene complexity image characteristics, and relation to non-verbal behavior. we then present the cmu-pittsburgh au-coded face expression image database, which currently includes 2105 digitized image sequences from 182 adult subjects of varying ethnicity, performing multiple tokens of most primary facs action units. this database is the most comprehensive testbed to date for comparative studies of facial expression analysis.
investigation of pathways for the low-ph conformational transition in influenza hemagglutinin. viral envelope glycoproteins promote viral infection by mediating the fusion of the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane. structural and biochemical studies of two viral glycoproteins, influenza hemagglutinin and hiv-1 envelope protein, have led to a common model for viral entry. the fusion mechanism involves a transient conformational species that can be targeted by therapeutic strategies. this mechanism of infectivity is likely utilized by a wide variety of enveloped viruses for which similar therapeutic interventions should be possible.
neural correlates of after-effects caused by adaptation to multiple face displays the psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task. this paper, together with its companion paper (wichmann & hill, 2001), describes an integrated approach to (1) fitting psychometric functions, (2) assessing the goodness of fit, and (3) providing confidence intervals for the function’s parameters and other estimates derived from them, for the purposes of hypothesis testing. the present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. using monte carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. first, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (orlapses). we show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function’s parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. we demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditionalx2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of monte carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. we have made available the software to implement our methods.
methodological considerations in the analysis of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in tufted capuchins (cebus apella) 1. the measurement of steroid hormone metabolites from faeces in wild animal populations is a powerful, noninvasive tool in behavioural endocrinology of all major vertebrate taxa. however, because such research is often done in remote areas with limited infrastructure, storage of samples for hormone analysis over long periods at high temperature is a critical issue in field endocrinology. previous studies have indicated that storage of alcoholic faecal extracts is more reliable than storage of unprocessed faeces if no freezer is available, but a standardmethod has not been established yet. 2. we tested the validity of three commonly applied storage conditions – liquid extracts, dried extracts and extracts placed on solid-phase extraction (spe) cartridges – to preserve concentrations of glucocorticoid and androgenmetabolites from faecal extracts of olive baboons (papio anubis) at high temperature over 1 year. 3. temporal variation in concentrations was detected for all metabolites and all storage conditions, including values measured from the control condition, that is, extracts stored at 20°c. this suggested that most variation was due to interassay variability, corroborated by comparisons of variation in ‘quality controls’ and samples. 4. compared to frozen control samples, liquid extracts were stable for up to 24 weeks, extracts on spe cartridges were stable for up to 50 weeks, while steroidmetabolite concentrations in dried extracts decreased slightly over time. 5. if steroid samples have to be stored at ambient temperature, we suggest storage of liquid extracts for up to 24 weeks in a dark and cool place. for longer periods, spe cartridges should be applied as evaporation, a potential confound arising with long-term storage of liquid extracts at higher temperatures, is not a problem in this storage condition. storage of dried extracts is more cost-effective, but may result in small time-dependent changes in steroid concentrations.
analysis and modeling of mobile traffic using real traces reliable network measurements are a fundamental component of networking research as they enable network analysis, system debugging, performance evaluation and optimization. in particular, decoding the lte control channel would give access to the full base station traffic at a 1 ms granularity, thus allowing for traffic profiling and accurate measurements. although a few open-source implementations of lte are available, they do not provide tools to reliably decoding the lte control channel and, thus, accessing the scheduling information. in this paper, we present owl, an online watcher for lte that is able to decode all the resource blocks in more than 99% of the system frames, significantly outperforming existing non-commercial prior decoders. compared to previous attempts, owl grounds the decoding procedure on information obtained from the lte random access mechanism. this makes it possible to run our software on inexpensive hardware coupled with almost any software defined radio capable of sampling the lte signal with sufficient accuracy.
ages induce oxidative stress and activate protein kinase c-beta(ii) in neonatal mesangial cells. the use of flow cytometric techniques has significantly aided the rapid advancement of our understanding of the process of apoptosis. our laboratory is currently involved in investigating the ways in which cells can be induced to die and some of the signals that may be involved. to this end, we are using flow cytometry to detect apoptosis in cell cultures and to measure intracellular changes that occur during apoptosis, in particular, alterations in parameters such as mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and gene expression. in this review of recent and ongoing research in our laboratory, we outline our studies on mechanisms of apoptosis by cytotoxic drugs, particularly in relation to the involvement of oxidative stress. in addition, we are studying the increased sensitivity to apoptosis seen in k652 cells that have been transfected with the p53 gene.
a three‐plane architectonic atlas of the rat hippocampal region we studied the distribution and coexpression of vesicular glutamate transporters (vglut1, vglut2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) and calretinin (cr, calcium-binding protein) in rat entorhinal cortex, using immunofluorescence staining and multichannel confocal laser scanning microscopy. images were computer processed and subjected to automated 3d object recognition, colocalization analysis and 3d reconstruction. since the vgluts (in contrast to cr and gad) occurred in fibers and axon terminals only, we focused our attention on these neuronal processes. an intense, punctate vglut1-staining occurred everywhere in the entorhinal cortex. our computer program resolved these punctae as small 3d objects. also vglut2 showed a punctate immunostaining pattern, yet with half the number of 3d objects per tissue volume compared with vglut1, and with statistically significantly larger 3d objects. both vgluts were distributed homogeneously across cortical layers, with in mea vglut1 slightly more densely distributed than in lea. the distribution pattern and the size distribution of gad 3d objects resembled that of vglut2. cr-immunopositive fibers were abundant in all cortical layers. in double-stained sections we noted ample colocalization of cr and vglut2, whereas coexpression of cr and vglut1 was nearly absent. also in triple-staining experiments (vglut2, gad and cr combined) we noted coexpression of vglut2 and cr and, in addition, frequent coexpression of gad and cr. modest colocalization occurred of vglut2 and gad, and incidental colocalization of all three markers. we conclude that the cr-containing axon terminals in the entorhinal cortex belong to at least two subpopulations of cr-neurons: a glutamatergic excitatory and a gabaergic inhibitory.
testosterone and financial risk preferences we hypothesized from the parasite theory of sexual selection that men (homo sapiens) would prefer averageness and symmetry in women's faces, that women would prefer averageness and symmetry in men's faces, and that women would prefer largeness (not averageness) of the secondary sexual traits of men's faces. we generated computer images of men's and women's faces and of composites of the faces of each sex, and then had men and women rate opposite-sex faces for 4 variables (attractive, dominant, sexy, and healthy). symmetry, averageness, and the sizes of facial features were measured on the computerized faces. the hypotheses were supported, with the exception of the hypothesized effects of averageness of female and male faces on attractiveness ratings. this is the first study to show that facial symmetry has a positive influence on facial attractiveness ratings.
ethnic differences in total and hdl cholesterol among turkish, moroccan and dutch ethnic groups living in amsterdam, the netherlands background ethnic minorities living in western societies may have a higher prevalence of diabetes. we investigated whether the prevalence of diabetes among turkish and moroccan migrants differs from the indigenous urban population in the netherlands, and whether these differences can be explained by differences in risk factors.   methods in 2004 a general health survey, stratified by ethnicity and age, was carried out among the population of amsterdam. the current study included 375 turkish, 314 moroccan and 417 dutch individuals aged 18-70 years. participants underwent a physical examination and a health interview. diabetes was based on self-report, the use of anti-diabetic medicine, blood glucose levels and hba1c.   results the prevalence of diabetes in the amsterdam population was significantly higher in turkish (5.6%) and moroccan (8.0%), compared to dutch individuals (3.1%). these differences, which were much larger after adjustment for age, were only partly explained by the lower socioeconomic status and higher frequency of obesity among ethnic minorities. the difference between dutch and moroccan individuals remained significant even after adjustments for multiple risk factors. the typical age of onset of diabetes in both turks and moroccans is respectively one and two decades younger than in the indigenous population.   conclusion diabetes is more prevalent among turkish and moroccan migrants as compared to the indigenous population. only part of this difference can be explained by differences in demographic and lifestyle risk factors.
opposing effects of nitric oxide and prostaglandin inhibition on muscle mitochondrial vo(2) during exercise. prostaglandins, nitric oxide (no) and endothelial‐derived hyperpolarizing factors (edhfs) are substances that have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow during physical activity. we measured haemodynamics, plasma atp and at rest and during one‐legged knee‐extensor exercise (19 ± 1 w) in nine healthy subjects with and without intra‐arterial infusion of indomethacin (indo; 621 ± 17 μg min−1), indo +ng‐monomethyl‐l‐arginine (l‐nmma; 12.4 ± 0.3 mg min−1) (double blockade) and indo +l‐nmma + tetraethylammonium chloride (tea; 12.4 ± 0.3 mg min−1) (triple blockade). double and triple blockade lowered leg blood flow (lbf) at rest (p < 0.05), while it remained unchanged with indo. during exercise, lbf and vascular conductance were 2.54 ± 0.10 l min−1 and 25 ± 1 mmhg, respectively, in control and they were lower with double (33 ± 3 and 36 ± 4%, respectively) and triple (26 ± 4 and 28 ± 3%, respectively) blockade (p < 0.05), while there was no difference with indo. the lower lbf and vascular conductance with double and triple blockade occurred in parallel with a lower o2 delivery, cardiac output, heart rate and plasma [noradrenaline] (p < 0.05), while blood pressure remained unchanged and o2 extraction and femoral venous plasma [atp] increased. despite the increased o2 extraction, leg was 13 and 17% (triple and double blockade, respectively) lower than control in parallel to a lower femoral venous temperature and lactate release (p < 0.05). these results suggest that no and prostaglandins play important roles in skeletal muscle blood flow regulation during moderate intensity exercise and that edhfs do not compensate for the impaired formation of no and prostaglandins. moreover, inhibition of no and prostaglandin formation is associated with a lower aerobic energy turnover and increased concentration of vasoactive atp in plasma.
