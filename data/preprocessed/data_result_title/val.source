associations of physical activity, sedentary time, and screen time with cardiovascular fitness in united states adolescents: results from the nhanes national youth fitness survey. background during childhood and adolescence, both physical activity (pa) and sedentary behaviour seem to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (crf); however, the combined association of pa and sedentary behaviour remains to be understood. we analysed the combined association of objectively measured sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous intensity pa (mvpa) on crf in portuguese children and adolescents. methods the sample comprised 2506 portuguese healthy children and adolescents aged 10–18 years, from a cross-sectional school-based study (2008). pa and sedentary behaviour were assessed with accelerometry. participants were classified as meeting current pa guidelines for youth versus not meeting, and as low versus high sedentary (according to the median value of sedentary time/day by age and gender), and then grouped as follows: low active—high sedentary; low active—low sedentary; high active—high sedentary; high active—low sedentary. crf was assessed with the fitnessgram 20 m shuttle-run test. binary logistic regression models were constructed to verify the relationship between high crf and the combined influence of mvpa/sedentary behaviour, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and accelerometer wear time. results participants classified as high active/low sedentary (or=1.81; 95% ci 1.21 to 2.69), as well as those classified as low active/low sedentary (or=1.27; 95% ci 1.01 to 1.61) were more likely to be fit, compared with those from the low-active/high-sedentary group. conclusion mvpa and sedentary behaviour may act independently in their relation with crf, and that mvpa levels may not overcome the deleterious influence of high-sedentary time in maximising crf.
elastic network models for rna: a comparative assessment with molecular dynamics and shape experiments elastic network models (enms) are a useful tool for describing large scale motions in protein systems. while they are well validated in the context of proteins, relatively little is known about their applicability to nucleic acids, whose different architecture does not necessarily warrant comparable performance. in this study we thoroughly evaluate and optimize the efficiency of popular enms for capturing rna and dna flexibility. we also introduce two alternative models in which the strength of elastic connections at a coarse-grained level is governed by distance distribution at atomic resolution. for each of the considered enms we report the optimal length of spring connections as well as the scaling of elastic force constants that provides the best agreement of vibrational frequencies with normal modes based on atomic force field. in order to determine the absolute values of force constants we introduce a novel method based on the overlap of pseudoinverse of hessian matrices.
preventive effect of aminoguanidine compared to vitamin e and c on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
effects of tolvaptan on dyspnoea relief from the everest trials. context decompensated congestive heart failure (chf) is the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in patients older than 65 years.   objective to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous nesiritide, intravenous nitroglycerin, and placebo.   design, setting, and patients randomized, double-blind trial of 489 inpatients with dyspnea at rest from decompensated chf, including 246 who received pulmonary artery catheterization, that was conducted at 55 community and academic hospitals between october 1999 and july 2000.   interventions intravenous nesiritide (n = 204), intravenous nitroglycerin (n = 143), or placebo (n = 142) added to standard medications for 3 hours, followed by nesiritide (n = 278) or nitroglycerin (n = 216) added to standard medication for 24 hours.   main outcome measures change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp) among catheterized patients and patient self-evaluation of dyspnea at 3 hours after initiation of study drug among all patients. secondary outcomes included comparisons of hemodynamic and clinical effects between nesiritide and nitroglycerin at 24 hours.   results at 3 hours, the mean (sd) decrease in pcwp from baseline was -5.8 (6.5) mm hg for nesiritide (vs placebo, p<.001; vs nitroglycerin, p =.03), -3.8 (5.3) mm hg for nitroglycerin (vs placebo, p =.09), and -2 (4.2) mm hg for placebo. at 3 hours, nesiritide resulted in improvement in dyspnea compared with placebo (p =.03), but there was no significant difference in dyspnea or global clinical status with nesiritide compared with nitroglycerin. at 24 hours, the reduction in pcwp was greater in the nesiritide group (-8.2 mm hg) than the nitroglycerin group (-6.3 mm hg), but patients reported no significant differences in dyspnea and only modest improvement in global clinical status.   conclusion when added to standard care in patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated chf, nesiritide improves hemodynamic function and some self-reported symptoms more effectively than intravenous nitroglycerin or placebo.
managing relationship decay using a retrospective method, we assessed late adolescents' developmental theories about their affective relationships with their parents. subjects used drawings and questionnaire ratings to portray their relationships with parents at five points between infancy and the present. from infancy to their current age, adolescents portrayed their relationships in two major ways. they perceived themselves as gaining in responsibility, dominance, independence, and similarity from infancy to the present, whereas they portrayed their parents as experiencing a decline on these dimensions. for variables indicating closeness and love, however, there was a striking discontinuity in these linear trends: although adolescents perceived linear trends from infancy to adolescence, they depicted their current relationships as involving a great deal more love and closeness. they also portrayed their relationships with mothers and fathers somewhat differently. more responsibility was felt towards the mothers and they were portrayed as especially friendly, but subjects felt more similar to their fathers, whom they perceived as dominant. we interpreted the results as indicating that late adolescents constructed theories of the affective components of their relationships with their parents to serve the needs of separation while maintaining a close affective tie to the parents.
transgenic expression of soluble human cd5 enhances experimentally-induced autoimmune and anti-tumoral immune responses cd5 is a 67 kda type i glycoprotein which belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (srcr) family of receptors. this family includes either cell-surface (e.g. cd6) or secreted (e.g. spalpha) proteins implicated in the development of the immune system and the regulation of immune responses. in this study, we purified and characterised a circulating natural soluble cd5 form (nscd5) which is indistinguishable (in apparent molecular mass, glycosylation pattern, and antibody reactivity) from a recombinant soluble cd5 form (rscd5) composed of the three extracellular scrc domains. the nscd5 is a n-glycosylated 52 kda molecule present in normal human serum and in supernatants of in vitro phorbol ester- and cd3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the nscd5 concentration in sera from healthy donors is relatively low (median 1.75 ng/ml, rn=166) and is similar to that found in sera from patients suffering of various autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus, primary sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis) and non-autoimmune (chronic renal failure, b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) disorders. in vitro experiments indicate that nscd5 is released by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane form. these results represent the first evidence of proteolytic release of a transmembrane srcr family member following cell activation.
anxiety and depression in working-age cancer survivors: a register-based study the objective of this study was to explore the psychosocial impact of cancer on newly diagnosed adolescent and young adult (aya) cancer patients.
substances with estrogenic activity in effluents of sewage treatment plants in southwestern germany. 2. biological analysis. the cdna of rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rter), highly and stably expressed in yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used to analyse the biological activity of the receptor. the rter mrna encoded a 65-kda protein which was immunorevealed by a specific antibody and migrated with the authentic rter major protein form detected in trout liver. yeast rter bound estradiol with high affinity and the dissociation constant (kd = 1.35 nm) was very similar to the value measured from trout liver extracts but 3-5-fold higher than the kd found for human estrogen receptor (her). this indicates therefore that the rter has a lower estradiol affinity compared to the human receptor. while the her kd remained unchanged at both 4 degrees c or 22 degrees c, it was slightly modified at 30 degrees c. the kd measured for rter at 22 degrees c and 30 degrees c were about 2-fold, and 12-fold higher, respectively, than the kd obtained at 4 degrees c suggesting an alteration of the rter affinity for its ligand at elevated temperature. to examine the estrogen-receptor-mediated activation of transcription in yeast, reporter plasmids integrated or not in the yeast genome were used. the reporter genes consist of one, two, or three copies of estrogen-responsive elements (ere) upstream of the yeast proximal cyc1 or ura3 promoters fused to the lacz gene of escherichia coli coding for beta-galactosidase. the induction of beta-galactosidase activity for all reporter genes was strictly dependent on the presence of rter and estrogens. the activation of transcription mediated by rter responded in an estradiol-dose-dependent manner as in animal cells. however, compared to her, the estradiol concentration necessary to achieve maximal activation was 10-fold higher. this is probably a consequence of the lower estradiol-affinity for rter compared to her. the levels of induction of the reporter genes containing two or three ere were strongly enhanced compared to the one ere construct. this is in agreement with the synergistic effect previously described for multiple ere. the magnitudes of transcriptional induction mediated by rter and her were similar when the reporter gene containing three ere was used but changed when the one ere construct was used. in this case transcriptional activation indicated by rter was 10-20 fold lower. this suggests that rter requires protein/protein interaction for its stabilization on dna. antiestrogens were able to bind rter and promote gene transcription. however, to produce effects comparable to those obtained with estrogens, much higher concentrations were required. this may imply nonetheless that antihormones were capable of provoking efficient interactions of rter with the transcriptional machinery.
soil c, n, p and its stratification ratio affected by artificial vegetation in subsoil, loess plateau china as the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (soc) and how vegetation change may affect soc distributions with depth. the goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of soc content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of soc; and (3) to estimate global soc storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. we based our analysis on .2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. the analysis focused on mineral soil layers. plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of soc. the per- centage of soc in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. in shrublands, the amount of soc in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. globally, the relative distribution of soc with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of soc. total soc content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. the importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling soc fractions at depth. to control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. the percentage of soc in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, inter- mediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests ( p , 0.05 in all cases). the effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. these data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of soc with depth. global soc storage in the to p3mo fsoil was 2344 pg c, or 56% more than the 1502 pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total soc estimates of 1500-1600 pg made by other researchers). global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 pg c, and the biomes with the most soc at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 pg c) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 pg c). our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control soc distributions with depth in the soil. our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and soc pools for carbon sequestration strategies.
the captive maned wolf (chrysocyon brachyurus): nutritional considerations with emphasis on management of cystinuria this study was designed to characterize the effect of urinary sodium excretion on amino acid excretion in cystinuria. we studied three homozygous patients with cystinuria at various levels of sodium intake ranging between 50 and 230 mmol/day. a reduction in sodium intake produced a marked decrease in rates of urinary cysteine excretion. the low-sodium diet also reduced the excretion of lysine but had no significant effect on the excretion of ornithine or arginine. we conclude that a dietary restriction of sodium may reduce the urinary excretion of cystine and can provide a simple and safe long-term approach to the treatment of cystinuria.
when are the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty large? many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
performance and immune responses to dietary beta-glucan in broiler chicks. β-glucan, one of the major cell wall components of saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been found to enhance immune functions. this study investigated in vivo and in vitro effects of β-glucan on lymphoproliferation and interferonγ (ifn-γ) production by splenic cells from c57bl/6 female mice. all experiments were performed with particulate βglucan derived from s. cerevisiae. data demonstrated that both, i.p administration of particulate β-glucan (20 or 100 μg/animal) and in vitro stimulation of splenic cells (20 or 100 μg/ml of culture) decreased lymphoproliferation and ifn-γ production induced by concanavalin a. these results suggest that β-glucan can trigger a down-modulatory effect regulating a deleterious immune system hyperactivity in the presence of a strong stimulus.
low-frequency atmospheric acoustic energy associated with vortices produced by thunderstorms abstract this paper attempts to explain the “whining” or “hissing” sound reported from tornadoes. the leading hypothesis is that the air masses involved in the tornado circulation execute some free vibrations. it is found that these vibrations may be in the audible range for a small vortex whose radius is of the order of 10 m. or less. a formula is obtained which relates the frequency of the tone to the inner radius of the vortex. this formula is amenable to experimental verification.
an inducible surface presentation system improves cellular immunity against human papillomavirus type 16 e7 antigen in mice after nasal administration with recombinant lactococci. abstract interleukin-12 (il-12), a heterodimeric cytokine, plays an important role in cellular immunity to several bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and has adjuvant activity when it is codelivered with dna vaccines. il-12 has also been used with success in cancer immunotherapy treatments. however, systemic il-12 therapy has been limited by high levels of toxicity. we describe here inducible expression and secretion of il-12 in the food-grade lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis. il-12 was expressed as two separate polypeptides (p35-p40) or as a single recombinant polypeptide (scil-12). the biological activity of il-12 produced by the recombinant l. lactis strain was confirmed in vitro by its ability to induce gamma interferon (ifn-γ) production by mouse splenocytes. local administration of il-12-producing strains at the intranasal mucosal surface resulted in ifn-γ production in mice. the activity was greater with the single polypeptide scil-12. an antigen-specific cellular response (i.e., secretion of th1 cytokines, il-2, and ifn-γ) elicited by a recombinant l. lactis strain displaying a cell wall-anchored human papillomavirus type 16 e7 antigen was dramatically increased by coadministration with an l. lactis strain secreting il-12 protein. our data show that il-12 is produced and secreted in an active form by l. lactis and that the strategy which we describe can be used to enhance an antigen-specific immune response and to stimulate local mucosal immunity.
hyperbinary expansions and stern polynomials we define a q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and the calkin-wilf sequence. we show that the nth term f(n;q) of the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence is the generating function for the number of hyperbinary expansions of n according to the number of powers that are used exactly twice. we also present formulae for branches within the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and predecessors and successors of terms in the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence.
identification of synthetic lethality of prkdc in myc-dependent human cancers by pooled shrna screening dna repair mechanisms are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity. disruption of gene products responsible for dna repair can result in chromosomal damage. improperly repaired chromosomal damage can result in the loss of chromosomes or the generation of chromosomal deletions or translocations, which can lead to tumorigenesis. the myc protooncogene is a transcription factor whose overexpression is frequently associated with human neoplasia. myc has not been previously implicated in a role in dna repair. here we report that the overexpression of myc disrupts the repair of double-strand dna breaks, resulting in a several-magnitude increase in chromosomal breaks and translocations. we found that myc inhibited the repair of γ irradiation dna breaks in normal human cells and blocked the repair of a single double-strand break engineered to occur in an immortal cell line. by spectral karyotypic analysis, we found that myc even within one cell division cycle resulted in a several-magnitude increase in the frequency of chromosomal breaks and translocations in normal human cells. hence, myc overexpression may be a previously undescribed example of a dominant mutator that may fuel tumorigenesis by inducing chromosomal damage.
revision surgery for failed unicompartmental knee replacement: technical aspects and clinical outcome. recent reports suggest good outcome results following unicompartmental knee replacement (ukr). however, a number of authors have commented on the problem of osseous defects requiring technically difficult revision surgery. we reviewed clinical outcomes following revision total knee replacement (tkr) for failed ukr and analysed the reasons for failure and the technical aspects of the revision surgery. between 2001 and 2010 our institute performed 132 ukr's out of which 33 required revision to tkr during a period 6 years. demographics, details and indications for primary and revision surgery, the revised prosthesis including augments, technical difficulties and complications were noted. patient outcome assessment was based on the oxford knee score (oks). survival analysis for the ukr prosthesis was calculated using kaplan-meier survival curves. reasons for revision included aseptic loosening, persistent pain, dislocated meniscus, mal-alignment and other compartment osteoarthritis. median time to revision was 19 months (range 2-159). using revision as the end-point the survival proportion at 5-years was 69%. 18 revisions required additional intra-operative constructs including stemmed implants, wedge augmentation or bone graft. the mean 1 year post-operative oks was 29 compared to 39 for primary tkr during the same period (p<0.001). aseptic loosening was the commonest mode of failure. ukr survivorship at a non-specialist institute is considerably lower than at originating centres. two thirds of the revisions were technically difficult and required additional constructs. the clinical outcome after revision surgery was inferior to that of primary tkr. the role of ukr needs to be more clearly defined.
quantitative assessment of the association between gstm1 null genotype and laryngeal cancer risk glutathione s-transferase (gst) isoenzymes are involved in the detoxification of several tobacco smoke-derived carcinogens. it is thus conceivable that deficiency in gst activity due to homozygous deletion of the gstm1 and gstt1 genes (the null genotypes) may modulate susceptibility to smoking-induced cancers. the effects of the gstm1 and gstt1 null genotypes on laryngeal cancer risk were evaluated using peripheral blood dna from 129 larynx cancer patients and 172 noncancer controls, all of whom were regular smokers. increased larynx cancer risk was related to the gstm1 null genotype [odds ratio (or) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.0-2.8]. the or associated with the gstt1 null genotype was increased, although not significantly (or = 1.4, 95% ci = 0.7-2.9). individuals with concurrent lack of gstm1 and gstt1 genes had a doubled, although not significant, risk for larynx cancer when compared with those having at least one of these genes (or = 2.0, 95% ci = 0.8-5.2) and had almost a 3-fold risk (or = 2.7, 95% ci = 1.0-7.4) when compared with those with both genes. moreover, a significant interaction between the gstm1 genotype and levels of tobacco consumption (p < 0.05) was found; the gstm1 null genotype was associated with an increased risk of larynx cancer among smokers of 20 g/day or less (or = 2.9, 95% ci = 1.3-6.3) but not among heavier smokers (or = 1.0; 95% ci = 0.5-2.0). in contrast, the gstt1 null genotype posed an increased, although not significant, risk among long-term smokers (or = 2.3, 95% ci = 0.9-5.4).
one-year mortality after severe copd exacerbation in bulgaria the aim of this study was to assess long-term mortality and predictive factors of death after hospital admission for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). 1824 patients (23.2% female; mean age 70.3±11.3 years) consecutively admitted for acute exacerbation of copd in the respiratory medicine departments of 68 general hospitals between october 2006 and june 2007 were prospectively enrolled in a follow-up cohort. their vital status was documented between october 2010 and april 2011. vital status was available for 1750 patients (95.9%), among whom 787 (45%) died during follow-up. multivariate analysis found that age (60–80 years and ≥80 years versus <60 years, relative risk 2.99, 95% ci 2.31–3.89), lower body mass index (25–30 kg·m−2 versus ≤20 kg·m−2, relative risk 0.80, 95% ci 0.66–0.97), lung cancer (relative risk 2.08, 95% ci 1.43–3.01), cardiovascular comorbidity (relative risk 1.35, 95% ci 1.16–1.58), previous hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of copd (four or more versus none, relative risk 1.91, 95% ci 1.44–2.53), use of accessory respiratory muscles (relative risk 1.19, 95% ci 1.01–1.40) or lower-limb oedema (relative risk 1.74, 95% ci (1.44–2.12)) at admission and treatment by long-term oxygen therapy at discharge (relative risk 2.09, 95% ci 1.79–2.45) were independent risk factors of death. mortality rate during the 4 years following hospital admission for acute exacerbation of copd was high (45%). simple clinical information relating to respiratory and general status can help in identifying high-risk patients and targeting more intensive follow-up and care. interestingly, cardiovascular comorbidities and past hospitalisations for acute exacerbation of copd, but not forced expiratory volume in 1 s, independently predicted the risk of death. long-term risk of death after hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of copd is high but can be readily identified http://ow.ly/li4gz
kin effects on energy allocation in group-living ground squirrels. since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
effect of methylphenidate in patients with cancer-related fatigue: a systematic review and meta-analysis abstract attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) often persists into adulthood. stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate, have showed efficacy in trials for adhd in adults. adult psychiatrists are likely to encounter increasing numbers of adult patients who may benefit from methylphenidate. a systematic review of the literature was made to examine the evidence on the safety of methylphenidate, when used therapeutically in adults. twenty-six placebo-controlled trials were found, in which 811 adults received methylphenidate for adhd and other conditions. in the short term, methylphenidate was well tolerated and no serious side effects were observed. there is little information on the long-term safety of methylphenidate in adults, although the number of serious adverse effects reported to regulatory authorities has, so far, been low. methylphenidate is associated with a modest rise in blood pressure and heart rate. surveys of stimulant use in us universities show that misuse of prescribed medication, for recreation or to enhance study, is fairly common although the level of harm that arises from this practice is unclear.
survey for the presence of ascaridoid larvae in the cinnamon flounder pseudorhombus cinnamoneus (temminck & schlegel) (pleuronectiformes: paralichthyidae). two cases of gastric anisakiasis have been documented in two italian women who had consumed raw anchovies (engraulis encrasicolus). the first patient was a 49-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain and bloody vomiting after ingestion of marinated (vinegar) raw anchovies. during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (egds) a white color worm was detected and extracted from cardia by means of biopsy forceps. the second patient was a 59-year-old woman with irritable bowel syndrome and gastritis, who underwent to periodical egdss. in the course of the last egds, a white color round worm on antrum and a small polyp on the fundus of the stomach were observed. the two nematodes have been identified as l3 larvae of the genus anisakis by a light microscope, and as anisakis pegreffi by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. the molecular identification of the etiological agent at the species level allows to identify what anisakidae species play a zoonotic role and which are the fish host species.
qt dispersion in amyloidosis due to familial mediterranean fever the aim of the study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial mediterranean fever (fmf). findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared with 32 patients with uncomplicated fmf and age- and sex-matched control subjects. all procedures followed stringent standards. repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the five beats were subsequently averaged. there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in average qt and average corrected qt interval length, average qt interval dispersion, average qt corrected dispersion, or qt dispersion ratio. during 6 months of follow-up, no cases of sudden death or arrhythmia were documented in either group. patients with fmf who are continuously treated with low-dose colchicine and have not developed amyloidosis seem to have qt dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects and therefore apparently have no increased risk of adverse cardiac events associated with abnormal repolarization.
early postoperative serum cystatin c predicts severe acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial introductionin critically ill patients sudden changes in glomerular filtration rate (gfr) are not instantly followed by parallel changes in serum creatinine. the aim of the present study was to analyze the utility of serum cystatin c as a marker of renal function in these patients.methodsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and 24-hour creatinine clearance (ccr) were determined in 50 critically ill patients (age 21–86 years; mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score 20 ± 9). they did not have chronic renal failure but were at risk for developing renal dysfunction. serum cystatin c was measured using particle enhanced immunonephelometry. twenty-four-hour body surface adjusted ccr was used as a control because it is the 'gold standard' for determining gfr.resultsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and ccr (mean ± standard deviation [range]) were 1.00 ± 0.85 mg/dl (0.40–5.61 mg/dl), 1.19 ± 0.79 mg/l (0.49–4.70 mg/l), and 92.74 ± 52.74 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (8.17–233.21 ml/min per 1.73 m2), respectively. our data showed that serum cystatin c correlated better with gfr than did creatinine (1/cystatin c versus ccr: r = 0.832, p < 0.001; 1/creatinine versus ccr: r = 0.426, p = 0.002). cystatin c was diagnostically superior to creatinine (area under the curve [auc] for cystatin c 0.927, 95% confidence interval 86.1–99.4; auc for creatinine 0.694, 95% confidence interval 54.1–84.6). half of the patients had acute renal dysfunction. only five (20%) of these 25 patients had elevated serum creatinine, whereas 76% had elevated serum cystatin c levels (p = 0.032).conclusioncystatin c is an accurate marker of subtle changes in gfr, and it may be superior to creatinine when assessing this parameter in clinical practice in critically ill patients.
hysteretic behavior of bladder afferent neurons in response to changes in bladder pressure although sacral anterior root neuromodulation (sarn) has proven to be effective in patients with neurogenic bladder, it is not widely accepted due to the need to conduct a dorsal rhizotomy, and commercially available sarn devices are not usually equipped with a closed-loop controller for the automatic regulation of bladder functions. therefore, there is still a need for a more effective electrical neuromodulation scheme to restore bladder function. intravesical pressure (ivp) is the major biosignal that reflects the state of bladder conditions. the present study develops a closed-loop control strategy for improving bladder emptying and verifies its performance using animal experiments. two channel outputs of electrical currents triggered by ivp-feedback signals were set to automatically regulate a rat's pudendal nerve for selective nerve stimulation and blocking. under this experimental design, a series of in vivo animal experiments were conducted on anesthetized rats, including the computational characterization of biosignals, the development of an intermittent high-frequency blocking current waveform for blocking the nerve, and verification of the control strategy. results show that the ivp-feedback control strategy for dual-channel pudendal neuromodulation performed well in animal experiments and could be utilized to selectively stimulate and block the pudendal nerve to augment bladder contraction and restore external urethral sphincter bursting activity to improve bladder emptying. this study demonstrates the feasibility of the ivp-based feedback-control strategy with animal experiments. the results could provide a basis for developing a sophisticated neural prosthesis for restoring bladder function in clinical use or for neurophysiological study.
complex memories in honeybees: can there be more than two? poor fetal growth is linked with long-term detrimental effects on health in adulthood. here we investigate whether the lifespan of male mice is affected by their growth rate when they were suckling and find that limiting growth during that period not only increases longevity but also protects against the life-shortening effect of an obesity-inducing diet later on. by contrast, we find that lifespan is considerably shortened if the postnatal period of growth is accelerated to make up for reduced growth in utero, and that, in addition, these mice are susceptible to the adverse effects on longevity of an obesity-inducing diet after weaning.
relation between clinical depression risk and physical activity and time spent watching television in older women: a 10-year prospective follow-up study. background: a growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, but there are limited data on black women.purpose: the objective was to evaluate the association between leisure time physical activity and depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.methods: participants included 35,224 women ages 21 to 69 from the blackwomen’s health study, a follow-up study of african american women in which data are collected biennially by mail questionnaire.women answered questions on past and current exercise levels at baseline (1995) and follow-up (1997). the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) was used to measure depressive symptoms in 1999. women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded. we used multivariate logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms (ces-d score <= 16) with control for potential confounders.results: adult vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (or = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.71−0.82) relative to never active women; the or was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% ci = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% ci = 0.77-0.91). although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (body mass index <= 30).conclusions: leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.
bronchoalveolar lavage versus bolus administration of lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant in meconium aspiration in newborn lambs background. animal-derived, protein-containing surfactants seem to be superior to protein-free surfactants. lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant containing a surfactant protein-b peptide analog, has been shown to be effective in animal models and phase ii clinical trials. to date, lucinactant has not been compared with an animal-derived surfactant in a premature animal model. objective. the objective was to compare the acute and sustained effects of lucinactant among premature lambs with respiratory distress syndrome (rds) with the effects of a natural porcine surfactant (poractant-α). methods. after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation twin premature lambs were assigned randomly to the lucinactant group (30 mg/ml, 5.8 ml/kg) or the poractant-α group (80 mg/ml, 2.2 ml/kg). heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, arterial ph, blood gas values, and lung mechanics were recorded for 12 hours. results. baseline fetal ph values were similar for the 2 groups (ph 7.27). after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation, severe rds developed (ph: <7.08; paco2: >80 mm hg; pao2: <40 mm hg; dynamic compliance: <0.08 ml/cm h2o per kg). after surfactant instillation, similar improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics were observed for the lucinactant and poractant-α groups at 1 hour (ph: 7.3 ± 0.1 vs 7.4 ± 0.1; paco2: 8 ± 18 mm hg vs 40 ± 8 mm hg; pao2: 167 ± 52 mm hg vs 259 ± 51 mm hg; dynamic compliance: 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg vs 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg). the improvements in lung function were sustained, with no differences between groups. cardiovascular profiles remained stable in both groups. conclusions. among preterm lambs with severe rds, lucinactant produced improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics similar to those observed with a porcine-derived surfactant.
cell proliferation is influenced by bulbectomy and normalized by imipramine treatment in a region-specific manner the main olfactory bulb (mob) is the first relay on the olfactory sensory pathway and the target of the neural progenitor cells generated in the subventricular zone (svz) lining the lateral ventricles and which migrate along the rostral extension of the svz, also called the rostral migratory stream (rms). within the mob, the neuroblasts differentiate into granular and periglomerular interneurons. a reduction in the number of granule cells during sensory deprivation suggests that neurogenesis may be influenced by afferent activity. here, we show that unilateral sensory deafferentation of the mob by axotomy of the olfactory receptor neurons increases apoptotic cell death in the svz and along the rostro-caudal extent of the rms. the vast majority of dying cells in the rms are migrating neuroblasts as indicated by double terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated utp nick-end labeling/psa-ncam labeling. counting bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in animals killed immediately or 4 days after tracer administration showed a bilateral increase in proliferation in the svz and rms which was balanced by cell death on the operated side. these data suggest that olfactory inputs are required for the survival of newborn neural progenitors. the greatest enhancement in proliferation occurred in the extension of the rms located in the mob, revealing a population of local precursors mitotically stimulated following axotomy. together, these findings indicate that olfactory inputs may strongly modulate the balance between neurogenesis and apoptosis in the svz and rms and provide a model for further investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity-dependent neuronal plasticity.
the prosecco server for chemical shift predictions in ordered and disordered proteins nmr chemical shifts provide important local structural information for proteins and are key in recently described protein structure generation protocols. we describe a new chemical shift prediction program, sparta+, which is based on artificial neural networking. the neural network is trained on a large carefully pruned database, containing 580 proteins for which high-resolution x-ray structures and nearly complete backbone and 13cβ chemical shifts are available. the neural network is trained to establish quantitative relations between chemical shifts and protein structures, including backbone and side-chain conformation, h-bonding, electric fields and ring-current effects. the trained neural network yields rapid chemical shift prediction for backbone and 13cβ atoms, with standard deviations of 2.45, 1.09, 0.94, 1.14, 0.25 and 0.49 ppm for δ15n, δ13c’, δ13cα, δ13cβ, δ1hα and δ1hn, respectively, between the sparta+ predicted and experimental shifts for a set of eleven validation proteins. these results represent a modest but consistent improvement (2–10%) over the best programs available to date, and appear to be approaching the limit at which empirical approaches can predict chemical shifts.
relationship of the changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
positive feedback-loop of telomerase reverse transcriptase and 15-lipoxygenase-2 promotes pulmonary hypertension telomere and telomerase alterations have been reported in mood disorders. however, the role of telomerase in depression remains unclear. here we show that chronic mild stress (cms) led to a significant decrease in telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) level and telomerase activity in the hippocampus. treatment with antidepressant fluoxetine reversed the cms-induced tert and telomerase activity changes. inhibiting telomerase by systemic administration (100 mg · kg−1 · d−1, i.p., for 14 d), intrahippocampal microinjection (0.7 μmol, 2 μl), or infusion (using an osmotic minipump, 0.134 μg/μl, 0.25 μl/h) of 3′-azido-deoxythymidine (azt) resulted in depression-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. in contrast, overexpressing telomerase by intrahippocampal infusion of recombinant adenovirus vector expressing mouse tert (ad-mtert-gfp) led to neurogenesis upregulation, produced antidepressant-like behaviors, and prevented the cms-induced behavioral modifications. disrupting neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by x-irradiation (15 gy) of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus abolished the antidepressant-like effect of ad-mtert-gfp. additionally, azt had no effect on dna polymerase activity and did not cause cell damage in vitro and in vivo. microinjection of azt into the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle (0.7 μmol, 2 μl) inhibited local neurogenesis but had no behavioral effect. these results suggest that hippocampal telomerase is involved in the modulation of depression-related behaviors, possibly by regulating adult neurogenesis.
sex and menstrual cycle effects on chronic oral cocaine self-administration in rhesus monkeys: effects of a nondrug alternative reward substantive evidence indicates that there are sex differences in the reinforcing effects of drugs, and gonadal steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, likely contribute to these differences. among females, subjective effects of drugs differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase. the purpose of the present study was to compare oral self-administration of phencyclidine (pcp) in female rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta) across different phases of the menstrual cycle. since the 28-day menstrual cycle of non-human primates is similar to that of humans, this model could provide important evidence supporting the implication that changes in the levels of gonadal hormones across menstrual phase can alter a drug's reinforcing effects. oral self-administration of several concentrations of pcp (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml) was examined in three sexually mature female monkeys during 3-h experimental sessions. menstrual cycle phase was determined by onset of menses and verified by examining vaginal cytology. pcp self-administration was greater during the luteal phase at the 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml concentrations, which is normally characterized by high levels of progesterone and moderate levels of estrogen, than during the follicular phase, when levels of estrogen are increasing and progesterone levels are low. when examined within each phase, numbers of pcp deliveries were highest during the mid-luteal phase, compared to the early and mid-follicular phases. no differences in self-administration were observed between early and mid-follicular phases, but a significant difference in pcp deliveries was found between mid- and late luteal phases at the lowest concentration of pcp tested. the results from this study suggest that pcp's reinforcing effects in female monkeys differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase.
predictors of recurrence during long-term treatment of bipolar i and ii disorders. a 4 year prospective naturalistic study. backgroundfew studies of the time to remission and first relapse in severe bipolar disorder have been based on epidemiologically defined samples or have examined patient characteristics and time-varying indicators of medication use simultaneously. using a cohort from the suffolk county mental health project, we describe these temporal patterns and their relationships with childhood, illness, and treatment characteristics.methoda multi-facility cohort of 123 first-admission inpatients with dsm-iv bipolar disorder with psychotic features was followed for 4 years. dates of the first complete remission (lasting at least 2 months), subsequent relapses, and use of antimanic (am),antipsychotic (ap), and antidepressant (ad) medications were recorded. childhood and illness characteristics were ascertained at baseline using standard instruments.resultsby the 4-year point, 83.7% had achieved a full remission, with 42.3% remitting within 3 months, 63.4% within 6 months, and 74.8% within 1 year. overall, younger age of onset, history of childhood psychopathology, and higher brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) anxiety/depression scores were significantly associated with longer time to remission. discontinuing am, ap and ad (compared to never using) and taking ap and ad (compared to never using) were significantly associated with remission in the multivariate analysis. of the 103 participants with complete remission, 61.2% suffered a relapse; 24.3 % relapsed within 6 months of remission, and 35.9% within a year. overall, 32.5% of the 123 participants had a single episode followed by full remission. childhood internalizing-type problems, higher bprs anxiety/depression and hamilton depression scores, and an admission episode not involving mania, but not patterns of medication use, were associated with shorter time to relapse.conclusionby 4-year follow-up, the majority of severely ill bipolar patients had remitted from their initial episode, but more than half subsequently relapsed. illness characteristics, especially depressive symptoms, and medication treatment were associated with the early course, although medication use after remission was not associated with relapse.
an empirical analysis of autobiographical memory specificity subtypes in brief emotion-focused and client-centered treatments of depression previous research on depressed and suicidal patients and those with posttraumatic stress disorder has shown that patients' memory for the past is overgeneral (i.e., patients retrieve generic summaries of past events rather than specific events). this study investigated whether autobiographical memory could be affected by psychological treatment. recovered depressed patients were randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual or treatment designed to reduce risk of relapse. whereas control patients showed no change in specificity of memories recalled in response to cue words, the treatment group showed a significantly reduced number of generic memories. although such a memory deficit may arise from long-standing tendencies to encode and retrieve events generically, such a style is open to modification.
increased parental history of bipolar disorder in the united states: association with early age of onset objective: to compare the prevalence rates of mental disorders among children of parents with bipolar disorder and of parents with no mental disorders. method: seventeen studies, meeting specific selection criteria, were included in the metaanalyses. risks for mental disorders among children were estimated by aggregating raw data from the selected studies. results: results indicate that in comparison with children of parents with no mental disorders, children of parents with bipolar disorder are 2.7 times more likely to develop any mental disorder and 4.0 times more likely to develop an affective disorder. the metaanalyses indicate that during childhood and adolescence, the risks for any mental disorder and for affective disorders in children are consistently but moderately related to having a parent who suffers from bipolar disorder. conclusions: risk factors that could account for the psychopathology observed in children of bipolar parents are explored.
gait asymmetry in patients with parkinson’s disease and elderly fallers: when does the bilateral coordination of gait require attention? cognitive function and the performance of a secondary, dual task may affect certain aspects of gait, but the relationships between cognitive function and gait are not well understood. to better understand the motor control of gait and the relationship between cognitive function and gait, we studied cognitive function and the effects of different types of dual tasking on the gait of patients with parkinson's disease (pd) and controls, contrasting measures of gait automaticity and rhythmicity with other features. patients with idiopathic pd (n = 30; mean age 71.8 year) with moderate disease severity (hoehn and yahr stage 2–3) were compared to age and gender‐matched healthy controls (n = 28). memory and executive function were also assessed. in both groups, gait speed decreased in response to dual tasking, in a parallel fashion. for the pd group only, gait variability increased compared to usual walking. executive function was significantly worse in the pd group, while memory was not different in the two groups. executive function measures were significantly correlated with gait variability during dual tasking, but not during usual walking. these findings demonstrate that regulation of gait variability and rhythmicity is apparently an automatic process that does not demand attention in healthy adults. in patients with pd, however, this ability becomes attention‐demanding and worsens when subjects perform secondary tasks. moreover, the associations between executive function and gait variability suggest that a decline in executive function in pd may exacerbate the effects of dual tasking on gait, potentially increasing fall risk.
long term effects of residential no(x) exposure on total and cause-specific mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction in a swedish cohort. background: the association of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes with air pollution exposures has been well established in the literature. the number of studies examining chronic exposures in cohorts is growing, with more recent studies conducted among women finding risk estimates of greater magnitude. questions remain regarding sex differences in the relationship of chronic particulate matter (pm) exposures with mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. objectives: in this study we explored these associations in the all-male health professionals follow-up study prospective cohort. methods: the same spatiotemporal exposure estimation models, similar outcomes, and biennially updated covariates were used as those previously applied in the female nurses’ health study cohort. results: among 17,545 men residing in the northeastern and midwestern united states, there were 2,813 deaths, including 746 cases of fatal coronary heart disease (chd). an interquartile range change (4 µg/m3) in average exposure to pm ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter in the 12 previous months was not associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (hr) = 0.94; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.87–1.00] or fatal chd (hr = 0.99; 95% ci, 0.87–1.13) in fully adjusted models. findings were similar for separate models of exposure to pm ≤ 10 µm in diameter and pm between 2.5 and 10 µm in diameter and for copollutant models. conclusions: among this cohort of men with high socioeconomic status living in the midwestern and northeastern united states, the results did not support an association of chronic pm exposures with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in models with time-varying covariates. whether these findings suggest sex differences in susceptibility or the protective impact of healthier lifestyles and higher socioeconomic status requires additional investigation.
enzymatic analysis of recombinant japanese encephalitis virus ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease with fluorogenic model peptide substrates the ns3 (dengue virus non-structural protein 3) serine protease of dengue virus is an essential component for virus maturation, thus representing an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed at the inhibition of polyprotein processing. in the present study, we have investigated determinants of substrate specificity of the dengue virus ns3 protease by using internally quenched fluorogenic peptides containing abz (o-aminobenzoic acid; synonymous to anthranilic acid) and 3-nitrotyrosine (ny) representing both native and chimaeric polyprotein cleavage site sequences. by using this combinatorial approach, we were able to describe the substrate preferences and determinants of specificity for the dengue virus ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease. kinetic parameters (kcat/k(m)) for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates with systematic truncations at the prime and non-prime side revealed a length preference for peptides spanning the p4-p3' residues, and the peptide abz-rrrrsagny-amide based on the dengue virus capsid protein processing site was discovered as a novel and efficient substrate of the ns3 protease (kcat/k(m)=11087 m(-1) x s(-1)). thus, while having confirmed the exclusive preference of the ns3 protease for basic residues at the p1 and p2 positions, we have also shown that the presence of basic amino acids at the p3 and p4 positions is a major specificity-determining feature of the dengue virus ns3 protease. investigation of the substrate peptide abz-kkqragvlny-amide based on the ns2b/ns3 polyprotein cleavage site demonstrated an unexpected high degree of cleavage efficiency. chimaeric peptides with combinations of prime and non-prime sequences spanning the p4-p4' positions of all five native polyprotein cleavage sites revealed a preponderant effect of non-prime side residues on the k(m) values, whereas variations at the prime side sequences had higher impact on kcat.
distinct regions control transcriptional activation of the alpha1(vi) collagen promoter in different tissues of transgenic mice the expression of type vi collagen has been studied in mouse tissues. by northern blotting, the mrna for the alpha 1 (vi) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10.5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. the messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. in 2-month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat were among the most active producers of alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in situ hybridization first identified mrna for alpha 1 (vi) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10.5-day embryos in various locations, including serosae, branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. in several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. this staining pattern was different from that for collagen type i, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. the pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in addition, the results confirmed that type vi collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. this was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. the data show that type vi collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue.
hmgb1/2 can target dna for illegitimate cleavage by the rag1/2 complex v(d)j recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. however, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant v(d)j recombination. translocations involving lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving sil/scl, are cited examples of illegitimate v(d)j recombination. previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (crsss) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support v(d)j recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide v(d)j recombination signals. to understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these crsss by the rag1/2 proteins that initiate v(d)j recombination. we find that the rag proteins comparably bind all crsss tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus rss. we show that four crsss that support levels of v(d)j recombination above background levels in cell culture (lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and sil) are also cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus rss. cleavage of lmo2 and ttg-1 by the rag proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated pcr. in contrast, hox11 and scl are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these crsss in cell culture.
roles of the traf6 and pellino e3 ligases in myd88 and rankl signaling tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor–associated factor (traf)-6 mediates lys63-linked polyubiquitination for nf-κb activation via its n-terminal ring and zinc finger domains. here we report the crystal structures of traf6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) ubc13. the ring and zinc fingers of traf6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. interaction of traf6 with ubc13 involves direct contacts of the ring and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. unexpectedly, this region of traf6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric c-terminal traf domain. structure-based mutagenesis reveals that traf6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that traf6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length traf6. the mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.
biomechanical analysis of defensive cutting actions during game situations: six cases in collegiate soccer competitions in many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. however, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. the aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. a laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. this provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. the test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 hz motion analysis system. root mean square (rms) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. rms velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the rms differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. in conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. the kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. this method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.
central injection of a new corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) antagonist, astressin, blocks crf- and stress-related alterations of gastric and colonic motor function. background/aims interleukin 1 beta (il-1 beta) increases the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) in the brain through prostaglandin pathways. because central crf inhibits gastric motor function, the influence and mechanism of action of intracisternal injection of il-1 beta on gastric emptying were investigated.   methods the 20-minute rate of gastric emptying of a nonnutrient test meal was assessed by the phenol red methylcellulose method 30 minutes after injection of human recombinant il-1 beta in conscious rats.   results il-1 beta injected intracisternally (0.01-1 ng) or intravenously (0.01-10 ng) dose-dependently decreased gastric emptying by 10%-82% and 0%-89%, respectively. the median effective dose (ed50) was 30-fold lower when il-1 beta was injected intracisternally (0.1 ng) than intravenously (3 ng). the inhibitory effect of intracisternal il-1 beta had a rapid onset (within 20 minutes) and was long-lasting (6 hours). indomethacin (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) completely prevented the 61% inhibition induced by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng) but had no effect on crf-induced (600 ng) 72% inhibition of gastric emptying. the intracisternal injection of the il-1 receptor antagonist (100 ng) or the crf antagonist [dphe12, [dphe12,nle21,38,c alpha meleu37]crf12-41 (20 micrograms) prevented by 100% and 52%, respectively, the inhibition of gastric emptying evoked by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng). the antagonists alone had no effect on basal gastric emptying.   conclusions il-1 beta acts in the brain to induce a long-lasting inhibition of gastric emptying; il-1 beta action is mediated through central il-1 receptors and prostaglandin- and crf-dependent mechanisms.
lamivudine plus adefovir or entecavir for patients with chronic hepatitis b resistant to lamivudine and adefovir. multi‐drug resistant hepatitis b virus (hbv) has been reported in hepatitis b patients who received sequential antiviral therapy. in vitro studies showed that hbv constructs with mutations resistant to lamivudine and adefovir have marked reduction in sensitivity to combination of lamivudine and adefovir, whereas constructs with mutations resistant to either drug remain sensitive to the other drug. we conducted this study to determine whether mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same hbv genome in vivo and to describe the evolution of these mutations. sera from six patients who had been found to have multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations to lamivudine + adefovir, lamivudine + hepatitis b immunoglobulin (hbig), or lamivudine + entecavir on direct sequencing were cloned after nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). analysis of 215 clones from 11 samples with multi‐drug resistant mutations on direct sequencing showed that 183 (85%) clones had mutations to both therapies on the same genome; 31 clones had lamivudine‐resistant mutants only. clonal analysis of serial samples from three patients showed progressive evolution from all clones with lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only to mixtures of clones that have multi‐drug resistant mutations and clones that have lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only, and ultimately all clones having multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations. in conclusion, mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same viral genome, suggesting that combination therapy directed against mutants resistant to each treatment may not be adequate in suppressing multi‐drug resistant hbv. de novo combination therapy may prevent the emergence of multi‐drug resistant mutants.

quercetin is equally or more effective than resveratrol in attenuating tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes. the facilitative glucose transporter, glut4, mediates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscles, and the participation of glut4 in the pathogenesis of various clinical conditions associated with obesity, visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance has been proposed. glucose uptake by some members of the glut family, mainly glut1, is inhibited by flavonoids, the natural polyphenols present in fruits, vegetables and wine. therefore it is of interest to establish if these polyphenolic compounds present in the diet, known to be effective antioxidants but also endowed with several other biological activities such as protein-tyrosine kinase inhibition, interfere with glut4 function. in the present study, we show that three flavonoids, quercetin, myricetin and catechin-gallate, inhibit the uptake of methylglucose by adipocytes over the concentration range of 10-100 microm. these three flavonoids show a competitive pattern of inhibition, with k(i)=16, 33.5 and 90 microm respectively. in contrast, neither catechin nor gallic acid inhibit methylglucose uptake. to obtain a better understanding of the interaction among glut4 and flavonoids, we have derived a glut4 three-dimensional molecular comparative model, using structural co-ordinates from a glut3 comparative model and a mechanosensitive ion channel [pdb (protein data bank) code 1msl] solved by x-ray diffraction. on the whole, the experimental evidence and computer simulation data favour a transport inhibition mechanism in which flavonoids and glut4 interact directly, rather than by a mechanism related to protein-tyrosine kinase and insulin signalling inhibition. furthermore, the results suggest that glut transporters are involved in flavonoid incorporation into cells.
dynamics of sleep–wake cyclicity at night across the human lifespan the ontogenesis of sleep was studied in prematures from 32 to 41 weeks of gestational age the characteristics of the eeg, the patterns and rate of respiration, the cardiac rate, body motility comprised of localized and diffuse movements, localized and diffuse jerks, clonic movements and electromyo-graphic activity of the chin, as well as periods of total quietness were observed and correlated with the progressive organization of behavior in these infants. the data obtained at each gestational age, i.e., at 32–34 weeks, 35–37 weeks, and 38–41 weeks, were compared to those obtained in full-term newborns. the relationships between the different events and the features of the eeg and of the respiratory patterns were ascertained and compared to similar data obtained in the full-term newborn. this comparison shows that the premature at 40 weeks of gestational age has not attained a level of organization as high as that of the full-term newborn. an hypothesis suggesting a possible mechanism of this discrepancy is presented.
reduced cardiac stiffness following exercise is associated with preserved myocardial collagen characteristics in the rat left ventricular (lv) chamber and myocardial wall compliance were investigated in rats with exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. voluntary exercise training was performed on running wheels. after 16 wk of exercise training, cardiac performance was measured in anesthetized open-chest ventilated rats. lv end-diastolic performance was calculated from both short-axis external diameter and long-axis segmental length measurements. exercise-trained rats developed significant lv hypertrophy (1.03 +/- 0.02 g) compared with control rats (0.91 +/- 0.03 g; p < 0.01). the physiological hypertrophy was associated with an increased lv wall thickness-to-internal radius ratio consistent with a concentric geometry. lv end-diastolic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-strain relationship) was decreased in both the short (p < 0.02) and long (p < 0.02) axis of lv as a result of exercise training. the lv end-diastolic chamber stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship) was also decreased in the exercised group (p < 0.05). the decreased chamber stiffness occurred as a consequence of a decrease in the regional myocardial wall elastic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic stress-strain relationship; p < 0.05). thus an increased lv wall thickness as a result of exercise-induced lv hypertrophy is associated with an enhanced ventricular chamber compliance, which in turn is attributed to a decrease in the diastolic stiffness of the myocardial wall.
spatial transcriptional profile of pept1 mrna in the yolk sac and small intestine in broiler chickens chick embryos derive nutrients from the yolk during incubation and transition to intestinal absorption of nutrients posthatch. the uptake of nutrients is mediated by a variety of membrane-bound transporter proteins. the objective of this study was to determine the expression profiles of nutrient transporters and digestive enzymes during incubation in the yolk sac membrane (ysm) and embryonic intestine of egg-laying (leghorn) and meat-producing (cobb) chickens derived from 22 to 30 wk (young) and 45 to 50 wk (old) breeder flocks. transporters examined included the peptide transporter pept1, the glutamate/aspartate (eaat3), cationic (cat-1) and neutral (b0at) amino acid transporters, and the fructose (glut5) and glucose (sglt1) transporters. digestive enzymes included aminopeptidase n (apn) and sucrase-isomaltase (si). expression of these genes was assessed by real-time pcr using the absolute quantification method in ysm at embryonic day (e) 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 21 and intestine at e15, 17, 19, 20, and 21. the pept1 and apn gene expression in the ysm increased until e15 and then decreased until e21, whereas expression in the intestine increased from e15 to e21. the b0at showed a similar pattern, with greatest expression in the ysm occurring at e17/e19. the cat1 and glut5 genes showed decreased expression in the ysm and increased expression in the intestine until e17/e19 and then a decrease until e21. expression of sglt1 and eaat3 showed increased gene expression over time in both the intestine and ysm. expression of si showed little to no gene expression in the ysm, whereas the intestine exhibited consistently high levels of gene expression. in ysm and intestine, si expression was greater in leghorn than cobb, whereas cat1 and glut5 expression was greater in cobb than leghorn. expression of the apn, cat1, and si genes was greater in embryos from young flocks than old flocks in ysm and intestine. these results demonstrate that the ysm expresses many of the digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters typically associated with the intestine and that these genes show tissue- and development-specific patterns of expression.
d-kefs tower test performance in patients with lateral prefrontal cortex lesions: the importance of error monitoring problem-solving ability was investigated in 25 dsm-iiir schizophrenic (sc) patients using the tower of hanoi (toh) task. their performance was compared to that of: (1) 22 patients with neurosurgical unilateral prefrontal lesions, 11 left (lf) and 10 right hemisphere (rf); (2) 38 patients with unilateral temporal lobectomies, 19 left (lt) and 19 right (rt); and (3) 44 matched control subjects. like the rt and lf group, the schizophrenics were significantly impaired on the toh. the deficit shown by the schizophrenic group was equivalent whether or not the problems to be solved included goal-subgoal conflicts, unlike the lf group who were impaired specifically on these problems. the nature of the sc deficit was also distinct from that of the rt group, in that the problem-solving deficit remained after controlling for the effects of spatial memory performance. this study indicates, therefore, that neither focal frontal nor temporal lobe damage sustained in adult life is a sufficient explanation for the problem-solving deficits found in patients with schizophrenia.
agroinfiltration reduces aba levels and suppresses pseudomonas syringae-elicited salicylic acid production in nicotiana tabacum plant hormones play important roles in regulating developmental processes and signalling networks involved in plant responses to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. salicylic acid (sa), jasmonates (ja) and ethylene (et) are well known to play crucial roles in plant disease and pest resistance. however, the roles of other hormones such as abscisic acid (aba), auxin, gibberellin (ga), cytokinin (ck) and brassinosteroid (bl) in plant defence are less well known. much progress has been made in understanding plant hormone signalling and plant disease resistance. however, these studies have mostly proceeded independently of each other, and there is limited knowledge regarding interactions between plant hormone-mediated signalling and responses to various pathogens. here, we review the roles of hormones other than sa, ja and et in plant defence and the interactions between hormone-mediated signalling, plant defence and pathogen virulence. we propose that these hormones may influence disease outcomes through their effect on sa or ja signalling.
lack of character displacement in the male recognition molecule, bindin, in altantic sea urchins of the genus echinometra. bindin is a gamete recognition protein known to control species-specific sperm-egg adhesion and membrane fusion in sea urchins. previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. the present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of echinometra in central america: e. lucunter and e. viridis from the caribbean, and e. vanbrunti from the eastern pacific. the eggs of e. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. as in the indo-west pacific (iwp) echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the iwp species. maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of e. lucunter. we analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the e. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the american echinometra. instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.
effect of low-level laser irradiation on the rate and short-term stability of rotational tooth movement in dogs. it has previously been reported that low-energy laser irradiation stimulated the velocity of tooth movement via the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b (rank)/rank ligand and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor/its receptor (c-fms) systems. matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v) beta(3) [alpha(v)beta3] integrin are essential for osteoclastogenesis; therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of low-energy laser irradiation on the expression of mmp-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v)beta3 integrin during experimental tooth movement. fifty male, 6-week-old wistar strain rats were used in the experiment. a total force of 10g was applied to the rat molars to induce tooth movement. a ga-al-as diode laser was used to irradiate the area around the moving tooth and, after 7 days, the amount of tooth movement was measured. to determine the amount of tooth movement, plaster models of the maxillae were made using a silicone impression material before (day 0) and after tooth movement (days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7). the models were scanned using a contact-type three-dimensional (3-d) measurement apparatus. immunohistochemical staining for mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 was performed. intergroup comparisons of the average values were conducted with a mann-whitney u-test for tooth movement and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap), mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3-positive cells. in the laser-irradiated group, the amount of tooth movement was significantly greater than that in the non-irradiated group at the end of the experiment (p < 0.05). cells positively stained with trap, mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 were found to be significantly increased in the irradiated group on days 2-7 compared with those in the non-irradiated group (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy laser irradiation facilitates the velocity of tooth movement and mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 expression in rats.
air quality and hospital outcomes in emergency medical admissions with respiratory disease in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, several episodes of extreme air pollution focused attention on the potential for adverse health effects of air pollution. these included an episode in the meuse valley, belgium, in december 1930 ( 15), an episode in donora, pennsylvania in 1948 (36), and several episodes in london, england (23, 44). the sudden large increases in sickness and death that accompanied such episodes demonstrated that air pollution can adversely affect human health. the increased mortality associated with such episodes provided the first quantitative measure of the adverse effects of air pollution. by the 1970s, a link had been well established between respiratory disease and particulate and/or sulfur-oxide air pollution, but still there remained disagreement as to the level of pollution that would significantly affect human health. in reviewing research published between 1968 and 1977, holland and several other prominent british scientists ( 19) concluded that particulate and related air pollution at high levels pose hazards to human health, but that health effects of particulate pollution at lower concentrations could not be "disentangled" from health effects of other factors. shy (45) responded by asserting that the review by holland et al systematically discounted evidence of pollution-related health effects at contemporary pollution levels. shy, and other reviewers ( 1, 12, 45, 54), contended that the cumulative weight of evidence provided sound reasons to believe that
when are the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty large? many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) predicts response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and clinical outcome in primary human breast cancer neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) is a small, secreted glycoprotein with proposed functions in cell proliferation, survival and morphogenesis. ngal is expressed in a variety of tumor types including breast carcinomas, but it is not known whether ngal contributes directly to breast cancer progression. this study examines the relationship between ngal expression in breast carcinomas and established clinical prognostic markers as well as clinical outcome. using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing well characterized tumor samples from 207 breast cancer patients, ngal was detected in 68 breast carcinomas in a cytoplasmic location. ngal expression correlated strongly with negative steroid receptor status, her-2/neu overexpression, poor histologic grade, the presence of lymph node metastases and a high ki-67 proliferation index. in univariate survival analysis, ngal expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival and decreased disease-free survival in the entire cohort. in multivariate analysis, ngal remained an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival. in a subset of patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors, ngal was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival. the results show that ngal expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in primary human breast cancer and suggest that ngal detection may provide information for risk assessment and identify a subset of patients requiring more aggressive adjuvant therapy.
model of the perception of smiling virtual character social psychological research demonstrates that the same behavior might lead to different evaluations depending on whether it is shown by a man or a woman. with a view to design decisions with regard to virtual humans it is relevant to test whether this pattern also applies to gendered virtual humans. in a 2×2 between subjects experiment we manipulated the rapport agent's gaze behavior and its gender in order to test whether especially female agents are evaluated more negatively when they do not show gender specific immediacy behavior and avoid gazing at the interaction partner. instead of this interaction effect we found two main effects: gaze avoidance was evaluated negatively and female agents were rated more positively than male agents.
cell-cycle synchronization of fibroblasts derived from transgenic cloned cattle ear skin: effects of serum starvation, roscovitine and contact inhibition. synchronization of the cell cycle stages in g0/g1 phase is one of the key factors determining the success of nuclear transplantation. serum deprivation, contact inhibition and chemical inhibitors are widely used methods for this purpose. in this study, cell cycle stages of foetal fibroblasts and cumulus cells were determined using flow cytometry [fluorescence-activated cell scan (facs)]. foetal fibroblasts (in vitro cultured for 72-120 h) and fresh cumulus cells were analysed in experiment 1. fifty to 55% proliferating fibroblasts remained in g0/g1 phase compared with 78% in confluent culture (p <0.05). in contrast to foetal fibroblasts, fresh cumulus cells maintained 90% of the population in the g0/g1 stage. when serum was retrieved from the proliferating fibroblasts from day 1 to day 5 (experiment 2), proportions of g0/g1 cells increased from the initial ratio of 53 to 87% at day 4 of starvation, which was significantly higher than the non-starved proliferating cells (p <0.05). in experiment 3, fibroblasts were treated with aphidicolin (0.1 microg/ml, 6 h), demicolcine (0.5 microg/ml, 10 h), or a combination of these two chemicals to synchronize the cell cycle stages. surprisingly, no differences or significantly lower in the proportions of g0/g1)phase cells were detected (25-50%) compared with the uncontrolled growing cells (53%). these results suggested that fresh cumulus cells rest their cell cycle in g0/g1 stage. serum deprivation became effective in the first 24 h and reached the highest proportions during days 4-5 after deprivation. chemical synchronization of the cell cycle stage of rabbit foetal fibroblasts to g0/g1 phase appeared less effective compared to serum deprivation.
the interaction of process and domain in prefrontal cortex during inductive reasoning despite the recent interest in the neuroanatomy of inductive reasoning processes, the regional specificity within prefrontal cortex (pfc) for the different mechanisms involved in induction tasks remains to be determined. in this study, we used fmri to investigate the contribution of pfc regions to rule acquisition (rule search and rule discovery) and rule following. twenty-six healthy young adult participants were presented with a series of images of cards, each consisting of a set of circles numbered in sequence with one colored blue. participants had to predict the position of the blue circle on the next card. the rules that had to be acquired pertained to the relationship among succeeding stimuli. responses given by subjects were categorized in a series of phases either tapping rule acquisition (responses given up to and including rule discovery) or rule following (correct responses after rule acquisition). mid-dorsolateral pfc (mid-dlpfc) was active during rule search and remained active until successful rule acquisition. by contrast, rule following was associated with activation in temporal, motor, and medial/anterior prefrontal cortex. moreover, frontopolar cortex (fpc) was active throughout the rule acquisition and rule following phases before a rule became familiar. we attributed activation in mid-dlpfc to hypothesis generation and in fpc to integration of multiple separate inferences. the present study provides evidence that brain activation during inductive reasoning involves a complex network of frontal processes and that different subregions respond during rule acquisition and rule following phases.
verbal memory and visual perception in early alzheimer’s disease: contribution of new diagnostic tools for new classification criteria the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild alzheimer's disease (ad). the present study investigates the relationships between performance on fcsrt and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural mri in patients with ad. three complementary mri-based analyses (vbm analysis, roi-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with ad to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the fcsrt. with vbm analysis, the total score on the fcsrt was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. in addition, using roi-based analysis, the total recall score on the fcsrt was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. with three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the ca1 field. no correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. in ad, the fcsrt may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the ca1 field of the hippocampus.
timing matters: long term effects of adversities from prenatal period up to adolescence on adolescents’ cortisol stress response. the trails study background animal models have linked early maternal separation with lifelong changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (hpa) axis activity. although this is paralleled in human studies, this is often in the context of other life adversities, for example, divorce or adoption, and it is not known whether early separation in the absence of these factors has long term effects on the hpa axis.   aims the finnish experience in world war ii created a natural experiment to test whether separation from a father serving in the armed forces or from both parents due to war evacuation are associated with alterations in hpa axis response to psychosocial stress in late adulthood.   method 282 subjects (m=63.5 years, sd=2.5), of whom 85 were non-separated, 129 were separated from their father, and 68 were separated from both their caregivers during wwii, were enlisted to participate in a trier social stress test (tsst), during which we measured salivary cortisol and, for 215 individuals, plasma cortisol and acth concentrations. we used mixed models to study whether parental separation is associated with salivary and plasma cortisol or plasma acth reactivity, and linear regressions to analyse differences in the baseline, or incremental area under the cortisol or acth curves.   results participants separated from their father did not differ significantly from non-separated participants. however, those separated from both parents had higher average salivary cortisol and plasma acth concentrations across all time points compared to the non-separated group. they also had higher salivary cortisol reactivity to the tsst. separated women had higher baselines in plasma cortisol and acth, whereas men had higher reactivity in response to stress during the tsst. participants who had experienced the separation in early childhood were more affected than children separated during infancy or school age.   conclusions separation from parents during childhood may alter an individual's stress physiology much later in adult life.
potential for anthropogenic disturbances to influence evolutionary change in the life history of a threatened salmonid salmonine fishes are commonly subjected to strong, novel selective pressures due to anthropogenic activities and global climate change, often resulting in population extinction. consequently, there is considerable interest in predicting the long‐term evolutionary trajectories of extant populations. knowledge of the genetic architecture of fitness traits is integral to making these predictions. we reviewed the published, peer‐reviewed literature for estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for fitness traits in salmonine fishes with two broad goals in mind: summarization of published data and testing for differences among categorical variables (e.g., species, life history type, experimental conditions). balanced coverage of variables was lacking and estimates for wild populations and behavioral traits were nearly absent. distributions of heritability estimates were skewed toward low values and distributions of genetic correlations toward large, positive values, suggesting that significant potential for evolution of traits exists. furthermore, experimental conditions had a direct effect on h2 estimates, and other variables had more complex effects on h2 and rg estimates, suggesting that available estimates may be insufficient for use in models to predict evolutionary change in wild populations. given this and other inherent complicating factors, making accurate predictions of the evolutionary trajectories of salmonine fishes will be a difficult task.
tissue-specific responses to loss of transglutaminase 2 we previously used subtractive hybridization to isolate cdnas for genes upregulated in chick hypertrophic chondrocytes (nurminskaya, m., and t.f. linsenmayer. 1996. dev. dyn. 206:260–271). certain of these showed homology with the “a” subunit of human plasma transglutaminase (factor xiiia), a member of a family of enzymes that cross-link a variety of intracellular and matrix molecules. we now have isolated a full-length cdna for this molecule, and confirmed that it is avian factor xiiia. northern and enzymatic analyses confirm that the molecule is upregulated in hypertrophic chondrocytes (as much as eightfold). the enzymatic analyses also show that appreciable transglutaminase activity in the hypertrophic zone becomes externalized into the extracellular matrix. this externalization most likely is effected by cell death and subsequent lysis—effected by the transglutaminase itself. when hypertrophic chondrocytes are transfected with a cdna construct encoding the zymogen of factor xiiia, the cells convert the translated protein to a lower molecular weight form, and they initiate cell death, become permeable to macromolecules and eventually undergo lysis. non-hypertrophic cells transfected with the same construct do not show these degenerative changes. these results suggest that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a novel, tissue-specific cascade of mechanisms that upregulate the synthesis of plasma transglutaminase and activate its zymogen. this produces autocatalytic cell death, externalization of the enzyme, and presumably cross-linking of components within the hypertrophic matrix. these changes may in turn regulate the removal and/or calcification of this hypertrophic matrix, which are its ultimate fates.
evaluation of 1-year-old children development in isfahan city and its effective factors using ages and stages questionnaire, in 2014 the number of children at risk for delays in motor and social development (msd) associated with preterm delivery and low birthweight is increasing, but such children are generally not seen as being in need of evaluation. the objective of these analyses was to determine whether there are independent effects of birthweight and gestational age on msd and the magnitude of effects. subjects were a representative sample of 4621 us-born singleton children, aged 2-47 months, examined in the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-94). msd was assessed using an age-appropriate scale. birthweight and gestational age were taken from birth certificates. mexican-american and 'other' race/ethnicity (other than non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black or mexican-american), low parental education level, older maternal age, higher birth order, low birthweight (lbw, <2500 g) and preterm delivery (<37 weeks) were all found to be associated with significant (p < 0.01) delays in msd. three per cent of the infants and children were preterm lbw and 2.2% term lbw (<2500 g, 37-44 weeks). adjusting for socio-demographic factors, preterm lbw children had lower msd scores (-1.5 +/- 0.3 points, p < 0.0001) through early childhood, as did term lbw children (0.8 +/- 0.4 points, p < 0.03). for females, lbw was the most important perinatal predictor of a lowered score (-0.9 +/- 0.3 points compared with normal birthweight, p < 0.04). for males, scores were additionally decreased by -0.1 +/- 0.03 points/week (p=0.001) of early delivery. lbw children had less muscle mass, but adjusting for muscularity did not diminish the effects of birth size on msd. lbw status and preterm delivery are associated independently with small, but measurable, delays in msd through early childhood and should be considered along with other known risk factors for development delays in determining the need for developmental evaluation.
growth dynamics of white muscle fibres in relation to somatic growth of larvae of european sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax, l.) two genetically different populations of sea bass, dicentrarchus labrax l., atlantic (atl.) and mediterranean (med.), were subjected to the following incubation/cultivation temperatures (t): 15 °c/natural, 17 °c/natural, 15/19 °c, 17/19 °c (natural t averaging 15 °c and raising gradually). muscle cellularity was measured at different larval stages for each t regime. during the vitelline phase, muscle growth was mainly due to muscle fibre hypertrophy. in med. larvae, higher incubation t (17 °c) increased the area of white and red fibres at hatching, while in atl. larvae there was no significant t effect at this stage. at mouth opening, the area of white fibres increased at 19 °c in atl. larvae (p<0.05), but in med. larvae it was similar for all temperatures. following yolk-sac reabsorption, hypertrophy and hyperplasia increased in both populations. in these stages (20–55 days), both parameters were greater at 19 °c (p<0.05). metamorphosis finished earlier at 19 °c. at this stage, atl. larvae reared at 19 °c showed higher value of total myotomal area than at natural t, while in med. sea bass, larvae reared at 19 °c showed a lower size of the myotome than at 17 °c/natural. in larvae from both populations reared at natural t, incubating t had a positive effect at the end of metamorphosis, thus the total myotomal area were higher at 17 °c/natural than at 15 °c/natural. following metamorphosis, all groups showed a rapid growth, but higher at 19 °c (p<0.05). the results indicate that muscle cellularity was clearly influenced by t, and that both populations had different levels of response. these differences can be apparently associated with their respective genetic background.
human papillomavirus type 8 interferes with a novel c/ebpβ-mediated mechanism of keratinocyte ccl20 chemokine expression and langerhans cell migration most nuclear proteins reside on a specific chromatin site only for seconds or less. the hit-and-run model of transcriptional control maintains that transcription complexes are assembled in a stochastic fashion from freely diffusible proteins; this contrasts to models involving stepwise assembly of stable holo complexes. however, the chances of forming a productive complex improve if the binding of one factor promotes the binding of its interactors. we prove here that in living cells, the glucocorticoid receptor and hmgb1 interact only within chromatin and not in the nucleoplasm and decrease each other's mobility. thus, the formation of a gr-hmgb1-chromatin complex is more likely than one would expect from independent binding to chromatin of gr and hmgb1. remarkably, this complex is potentially stable, and its disassembly is effected by active, atp-consuming processes. we propose that kinetic cooperativity among transcription factors in chromatin binding may be a common feature in transcription and dna transactions.
sequential organ failure assessment score for evaluating organ failure and outcome of severe maternal morbidity in obstetric intensive care study objectives to determine the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) and organ failure and to describe the outcomes in critically ill obstetric patients who have been treated in medical icus.   design retrospective review.   setting a multidisciplinary icu at a tertiary-care institution.   methods we collected data on 74 obstetric patients who were admitted consecutively to the icu from january 1991 through december 1998. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii scores were calculated. a p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant.   measurements and results fifty-eight percent of patients were admitted to the icu postpartum. their mean (+/- sd) age was 25.9 +/- 7.0 years, and 64% were african american and 34% were white. fifty percent had preexisting medical conditions. their mean apache ii score was 14.0 +/- 5.9, and their predicted mortality rate was 17.6%. the most common reason for admission was respiratory insufficiency. preeclampsia was present in 38% of patients, and hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome were present in 7% of patients. sirs developed in 59% of patients. patients with sirs had longer icu stays (p = 0.0008). organ failure developed in 65% of patients, and ards developed in 15% of patients. invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 45% of patients, and pulmonary artery catheterization was required in 35% of patients. the in-hospital mortality rate was 2.7%. there were five spontaneous abortions and eight perinatal deaths.   conclusions the most common reason for admission to the icu of critically ill obstetric patients was respiratory failure. despite the severity of illness and the development of sirs and organ failure in most patients, the mortality rate was low.
the right hemisphere of sleeping infant perceives sentential prosody we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to characterize cortical activation associated with sentence processing, thereby elucidating where in the brain auditory and visual inputs of words converge during sentence comprehension. within one scanning session, subjects performed three types of tasks with different linguistic components from perception to sentence comprehension: nonword (n(av); auditory and visual), phrase (p; either auditory or visual), and sentence (s; either auditory or visual) tasks. in a comparison of the p and n(av) tasks, the angular and supramarginal gyri showed bilateral activation, whereas the inferior and middle frontal gyri showed left-lateralized activation. a comparison of the s and p tasks, together with a conjunction analysis, revealed a ventral region of the left inferior frontal gyrus (f3t/f3o), which was sentence-processing selective and modality-independent. these results unequivocally demonstrated that the left f3t/f3o is involved in the selection and integration of semantic information that are separable from lexico-semantic processing.
identification and prediction of distress trajectories in the first year after a breast cancer diagnosis. depression is a significant problem for some breast cancer survivors after the end of treatment. this study assessed depression using the ces‐d for 84 breast cancer patients at the conclusion of radiation treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post‐treatment. based on the pattern of ces‐d scores, patients were divided into five groups: (1) stay depressed (scores above clinical cutoff for depression at all timepoints); (2) recover (above threshold at baseline, but below at follow‐up); (3) become depressed (below threshold at baseline, but above at follow‐up); (4) never depressed (below threshold at all times); and (5) vacillate (none of the above patterns). this study examined the relationships between depression groups and a variety of medical, demographic, and psychological measures, including anxiety and quality of life (qol). number of children at home significantly distinguished the groups, with the become depressed group having more children and the vacillate group having fewer children. anxiety levels were different among the groups, with recover and never depressed groups having consistently lower anxiety scores. qol scores also distinguished the groups in that never depressed patients demonstrated better qol than all other groups. the findings have implications for understanding resilience in cancer patients. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
green liquor dregs effect on kraft mill secondary sludge composting. two-phase olive mill waste (tpomw) is a semisolid sludge generated during the extraction of olive oil by the two-phase centrifugation system. among all the available disposal options, composting is gaining interest as a sustainable strategy to recycle tpomw for agricultural purposes. the quality of compost for agronomical use depends on the degree of organic matter stabilization, but despite several studies on the topic, there is not a single method available which alone can give a certain indication of compost stability. in addition, information on the biological and biochemical properties, including the enzymatic activity (ea) of compost, is rare. the aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of some enzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid-phosphatase, alkaline-phosphatase, urease and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (fda)) as parameters to evaluate organic matter stability during the composting of tpomw. these enzymatic indices were also compared to conventional stability indices. for this purpose two composting piles were prepared by mixing tpomw with sheep manure and grape stalks in different proportions, with forced aeration and occasional turnings. the composting of tpomw followed the common pattern reported previously for this kind of material with a reduction of 40-50% of organic matter, a gradual increase in ph, disappearance of phytotoxicity and formation of humic-like c. all ea increased during composting except acid-phosphatase. significant correlations were found between ea and some important conventional stability indices indicating that ea can be a simple and reliable tool to determine the degree of stability of tpomw composts.
combination therapy with sulfasalazine and valproic acid promotes human glioblastoma cell death through imbalance of the intracellular oxidative response temozolomide (tmz) is an oral alkylating agent that has been widely used in the treatment of refractory glioma, although inherent and acquired resistance to this drug is common. the clinical use of valproic acid (vpa) as an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug has been reported primarily for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder and less commonly for major depression. vpa is also used in the treatment of glioma-associated seizures with or without intracranial operation. in this study, we evaluated the potential synergistic effect of tmz and vpa in human glioma cell lines. compared with the use of tmz or vpa alone, concurrent treatment with both drugs synergistically induced apoptosis in u87mg cells as evidenced by p53 and bax expression, mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, reactive oxygen species production, and glutathione depletion. this synergistic effect correlated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor and corresponded with reduced heme oxygenase-1 and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression. pretreatment with n-acetylcysteine partially recovered the apoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination treatment. the same degree of synergism is also seen in p53-mutant hs683 cells, which indicates that p53 may not play a major role in the increased proapoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination. in conclusion, vpa enhanced the apoptotic effect of tmz, possibly through a redox regulation mechanism. the tmz/vpa combination may be effective for treating glioma cancer and may be a powerful agent against malignant glioma. this drug combination should be further explored in the clinical setting.
fibronectin stimulates human sperm capacitation through the cyclic amp/protein kinase a pathway. signal transduction pathways regulate various aspects of mammalian sperm function. when human sperm were incubated in a medium supporting capacitation, proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. this phosphorylation was inhibited by genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. phosphorylation was also reduced when sperm were incubated either in the presence of increasing concentrations of extracellular ca2+ or in a medium containing the ca2+ ionophore a23187. this ca2+-induced dephosphorylation was calmodulin-dependent, suggesting that calcineurin was involved. in this regard, the calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin inhibited the ca2+ ionophore-induced dephosphorylation. a limited number of mr 80,000-105,000 polypeptides were the most prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins present in human sperm. unlike mouse sperm, which contains a tyrosine-phosphorylated isoform of hexokinase, a phosphotyrosine-containing hexokinase in human sperm was not detected. most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were triton x-100-insoluble and were localized to the principal piece of the flagellum, the region where the cytoskeletal fibrous sheath is found. prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of mr 82,000 and 97,000 were identified as the human homologues of mouse sperm akap82, the major fibrous sheath protein, and pro-akap82, its precursor polypeptide, respectively. these proteins are a kinase anchor proteins, polypeptides that sequester protein kinase a to subcellular locations. taken together, these results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation may be part of a signal transduction cascade(s) regulating events pertaining to capacitation and/or motility in mammalian sperm and that an interrelationship between tyrosine kinase and camp signaling pathways exists in these cells.
local and global contributions to hemodynamic activity in mouse cortex potential contributions of concurrently acquired pupil dilation data to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) experiments were examined. sixteen healthy participants completed a working memory task (digit sorting) during measurement of pupil dilation outside the fmri environment and during concurrent 3t fmri assessment. pupil dilation increased parametrically with task difficulty inside and outside the scanner, on a similar time course, suggesting that task demand was similar in both environments. the time course of pupil dilation during digit sorting was similar to the time course of the fmri signal in the middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that middle-frontal gyrus activity indexed the engagement working memory processes. incorporating individual differences in pupil dilation improved the sensitivity and specificity of general linear modeling analyses of activity in the middle frontal gyrus, above and beyond standard analytic techniques. results suggest concurrent pupil dilation during fmri assessment can help to (1) specify whether task demand is the same inside and outside the fmri environment, (2) resolve the extent to which fmri signals reflect different aspects of event-related designs, and (3) explain variation in fmri data due to individual differences in information processing.
delineating the genetic heterogeneity of oca in hungarian patients oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a rare genetic disorder of melanin synthesis that results in hypopigmented hair, skin, and eyes. there are four types of oca caused by mutations in tyr (oca‐1), oca2 (oca‐2), tyrp1 (oca‐3), or slc45a2 (oca‐4). here we report 22 novel mutations in the oca genes; 14 from a cohort of 61 patients seen as part of the nih oca natural history study and eight from a prior study at the university of minnesota. we also include a comprehensive list of almost 600 previously reported oca mutations along with ethnicity information, carrier frequencies, and in silico pathogenicity predictions as a supplement. in addition to discussing the clinical and molecular features of oca, we address the cases of apparent missing heritability. in our cohort, 26% of patients did not have two mutations in a single oca gene. we demonstrate the utility of multiple detection methods to reveal mutations missed by sanger sequencing. finally, we review the tyr p.r402q temperature‐sensitive variant and confirm its association with cases of albinism with only one identifiable tyr mutation.
changes in health status for persons with wrist or hand impairments receiving occupational therapy or physical therapy. study design effect of clinical specialization was studied in a retrospective analysis of a commercial outcomes database.   objective to assess effectiveness of care as measured by changes in health status and efficiency as measured by visits, duration of treatment episode, and net revenue between patients treated by clinicians with and without orthopaedic clinical specialist certification (ocs).   background clinical specialization is becoming common in physical therapy, but there are no studies to support improved efficiency or effectiveness with advanced practitioner competencies.   methods and measures a total of 258 adults treated in practices participating in the focus on therapeutic outcomes process during 1996 comprised the data set. seven physical therapists with ocs treated 129 patients (clinical specialist group). these patients were matched to 129 patients not treated by physical therapists with ocs (comparison group) randomly chosen from the aggregate data set. all patients completed a standardized health status questionnaire at initial evaluation and discharge. standardized response means (srms) were calculated to measure change during treatment.   results therapists with ocs were more efficient than therapists without ocs, using fewer visits (9.1 +/- 6.7 vs 11.2 +/- 7.4) for less estimated cost ($949 +/- $736 vs $1238 +/- $1227) during the same treatment duration (35.9 +/- 48.3 vs 35.4 +/- 25.6 days) and performed fewer treatment procedures. overall, there was no difference in effectiveness as measured by change in health status, that is, unit of functional improvement per episode (0.89 +/- 1.0 srm for clinical specialists compared with 0.88 +/- 1.0 srm for comparison group). the ocs group had better value (unit of functional improvement per estimated dollar) and utilization (unit of functional improvement per visit) for the constructs of physical functioning (value: 1.31 +/- 2.7 vs 0.78 +/- 1.8; utilization: 1.25 +/- 2.2 vs 0.76 +/- 1.6) and role physical (value: 1.26 +/- 2.9 vs 0.44 +/- 3.5; utilization: 1.11 +/- 1.9 vs 0.51 +/- 2.3) (srms for ocs group vs comparison group, respectively).   conclusions our data support the conclusion that physical therapists with ocs are more efficient compared with clinicians without ocs. study limitations in design, small sample size, and low number of clinicians are discussed.
enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (esbls) colonization as a risk factor for developing esbl infections in pediatric cardiac surgery patients: “retrospective cohort study” introduction the incidence of multidrug resistant microorganisms worldwide is increasing. the aim of the study was to present institutional experience with the multidrug resistant microorganism colonization patterns observed in children with congenital heart diseases hospitalized in a hybrid pediatric cardiac surgery center. material and methods microbiological samples were routinely collected in all children admitted to our department. all microbiological samples were analyzed with regard to multidrug resistant microorganisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), gram-negative rods producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), multidrug resistant gram-negative rods (mdr-gnrs), carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (kpc), carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (crab) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (crpa). results in 30 (9%) swabs ‘alert’ pathogens from the above group of listed microorganisms were found. all positive swabs were isolated in 19 (16.1%) children. multidrug resistant pathogen colonization was statistically significantly more often observed in children admitted from other medical facilities than in children admitted from home (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.0089). in the group of children younger than 6 months ‘alert’ pathogen were more often observed than in older children (34.1% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). conclusions preoperative multidrug resistant pathogen screening in children admitted and referred for congenital heart disease procedures may be of great importance since many of these patients are colonized with resistant bacteria. knowledge of the patient's microbiome is important in local epidemiological control along with tailoring the most effective preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for each patient. the impact of preoperative screening on postoperative infections and other complications requires further analysis.
cases of typhoid fever in copenhagen region: a retrospective study of presentation and relapse we reviewed 232 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary-care hospital under the care of an infectious diseases unit for management of febrile illness acquired overseas. a total of 53% presented to hospital within 1 week of return and 96% within 6 months. malaria was the most common diagnosis (27% of patients), followed by respiratory tract infection (24%), gastroenteritis (14%), dengue fever (8%), and bacterial pneumonia (6%). pretravel vaccination may have prevented a number of admissions, including influenza (n=11), typhoid fever (n=8) and hepatitis a (n=6). compared to those who had not traveled to africa, those who had were 6 times more likely to present with falciparum than nonfalciparum malaria. an itinerary that included asia was associated with a 13-fold increased risk of dengue, but a lower risk of malaria. palpable splenomegaly was associated with an 8-fold risk of malaria and hepatomegaly with a 4-fold risk of malaria. as a cause of fever, bacterial pneumonia was > or =5 times more likely in those who were aged >40 years.
the thoracic anatomy of the male and female winter moth nyssiodes lefuarius (lepidoptera: geometridae) and evolutionary changes in the thorax of moths and butterflies in order to facilitate the study of the evolution of female flightlessness among the geometrid subfamily ennominae (lepidoptera, geometridae), we carried out a phylogenetic analysis based on a morphological data matrix, and dna sequences. we used seven nuclear gene fragments, elongation factor 1alpha (ef-1alpha), wingless (wgl), isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), ribosomal protein s5 (rps5) and segments d1 and d2 of the 28s rrna gene, and one mitochondrial gene fragment, cytochrome oxidase subunit i (coi). sampling included 55 species of ennominae covering all tribes with flightless females of the holarctic boreal zone, and some other geometrids used as outgroups. our results clearly confirmed that ennominae (including alsophila of the traditional subfamily alsophilinae) is a monophyletic group, as well as supported the previously established morphology-based division of ennominae into "ennomine" and "boarmiine" groups of genera. a number of taxonomic ambiguities were resolved but the monophyly of the traditionally recognised tribe bistonini, comprising a number of flightless species, remained ambiguous. bistonini is thus suggested to be subsumed to the tribe boarmiini in the broad sense. indeed, an analysis of timing of divergence suggested that boarmiini s. lat. rapidly diversified in the late oligocene/early miocene. within the ennominae, seven independent origins of female flightlessness were revealed facilitating phylogenetic comparative analyses to be performed in search of causes and consequences of this phenomenon. the present phylogenetic hypothesis supports the conclusions of the "adaptive story", a hypothesis of the sequence of evolutionary events leading to flightlessness, we have presented earlier (snäll et al., 2007). in particular, in the "boarmiine" group, the tribe boarmiini s. lat. clearly represents a group of geometrids in which female flightlessness has evolved more frequently than in any other tribes, suggesting that this clade has likely been predisposed to evolutionary events leading to the manifestation of female flightlessness. the ancestor of the wing-reduced ennominae has likely been a winged but slow flying forest moth feeding polyphagously on deciduous trees.
limit theorems for multifractal products of geometric stationary processes in various fields, such as teletraffic and economics, measured time series have been reported to adhere to multifractal scaling. classical cascading measures possess multifractal scaling, but their increments form a nonstationary process. to overcome this problem, we introduce a construction of random multifractal measures based on iterative multiplication of stationary stochastic processes, a special form of t-martingales. we study the ℒ2-convergence, nondegeneracy, and continuity of the limit process. establishing a power law for its moments, we obtain a formula for the multifractal spectrum and hint at how to prove the full formalism.
characterization of rat intestinal microsomal udp-glucuronosyltransferase activity toward mycophenolic acid gastrointestinal surgery was used in order to determine the role of normal food components, bile and pancreatic secretion in the control of mucosal glucuronide synthesis. furthermore a few rats were treated either intragastrically or intraperitoneally with phenobarbitone. both the rate of o-aminophenyl glucuronide synthesis in slices and the activity of udp glucuronyltransferase in mucosal extracts were studied. in partial jejunectomies no changes were found in glucuronide synthesis when compared with the controls, but in jejunal thiry-vella loops and in duodenal and jejunal blind sacs the glucuronide synthesis rate was significantly lower. in gastro-jejunostomized rats a transient increase in the glucuronide synthesis rate was noted in the gastro-jejunostomy area. phenobarbitone administration did not increase the small intestinal udp glucuronyltransferase activity when administered either intraperitoneally or intragastrically. the results indicate that the chyme factors are of importance in the control of glucuronide synthesis in the small intestine of the rat, but that phenobarbitone has no effect.
an eccentrically biased rehabilitation program early after tka surgery background context in the last decade, the number of patients undergoing surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis (lss), particularly instrumented fusions, has significantly increased. the surgical procedures for lss represent a significant cost to the health-care system and are a priority focus for most governments, insurers, hospital administrators, and spine care physicians.   purpose the purpose of this study was to directly compare the relative improvement in self-reported quality of life after surgical intervention for matched groups of patients with primary hip or knee osteoarthritis (h-oa/k-oa) and focal lumbar spinal stenosis (flss).   study design/setting observational cohort study of prospectively collected outcomes.   patient sample patients, following elective primary one- to two-level spinal decompression (n=90) with (n=28/90) or without fusion for flss, were compared with a matched (age, sex, and time of surgery) cohort of patients who had undergone elective total hip (n=90) or total knee (n=90) arthroplasty (total joint arthroplasty [tja]) for primary osteoarthritis.   outcome measures medical outcomes study short form-36 (sf-36).   methods patents were obtained for prospective outcomes databases (tja and spine). inclusion and exclusion criteria were independently applied, and matching was performed in a blinded fashion. the primary outcome measure was the relative change between preoperative and 2-year postoperative sf-36 questionnaires. data were analyzed with the t test and repeated measures analysis of variance (anova).   results the three groups (flss/h-oa/k-oa) were equally matched with respect to mean age (64/63/65 years), sex (female/male, 51/39 for all groups), body mass index (bmi) (27/24/27), and american society of anesthesiologists (asa) physical status (2/2/2). comparison of preoperative sf-36 physical component summary (pcs) scores and mental component summary (mcs) scores between groups showed no statistical difference (pcs: flss=32.0, h-oa=30.2, k-oa=31.3 [p=.32, anova]/mcs: flss=43.5, h-oa=45.0, k-oa=46.2 [p=.25, anova]). postoperatively, pcs improved significantly for all groups (1 year-pcs: flss=39.6, h-oa=44.5, k-oa=38.5 [p<.0001 for all groups]; 2 years-pcs: flss=38.6, h-oa=43.2, k-oa=37.1 [p<.0001 for all groups]). at both 1- and 2-year follow-ups, the pcs improvement between groups was greater for the h-oa group compared with the flss (p=.0037, p=.0073) and k-oa (p=.00016, p=.00053) groups. at the 1-year follow-up, mcs did not significantly increase for any group; however, 2 years postoperatively, mcs improved significantly for the flss and h-oa groups (2 years-mcs: flss=50.3, h-oa=50.9, k-oa=44.8 [p=.00021, p=.00079, p=.35]). at the 1-year follow-up, there was no statistical difference in mcs improvement between groups (p=.45, anova). two years postoperatively, the mcs for both the flss and h-oa groups was significantly greater than that for the k-oa group (p=.0014, p=.00055).   conclusions the results of this study show that surgical intervention for flss can obtain and maintain improvement in self-reported quality of life comparable to that of total hip and knee arthroplasty. this study provides data to support the need for prospective cost-effectiveness studies for the surgical management of appropriately selected patients suffering from flss.
hiv entry in macrophages is dependent on intact lipid rafts rice mutant database (rmd, ) is an archive for collecting, managing and searching information of the t-dna insertion mutants generated by an enhancer trap system. we have generated ∼129 000 rice mutant (enhancer trap) lines that are now being gathered in the database. information collected in rmd includes mutant phenotypes, reporter-gene expression patterns, flanking sequences of t-dna insertional sites, seed availability and others, and can be searched by respective id, keyword, nucleotide sequence or protein sequence on the website. this database is both a mutant collection for identifying novel genes and regulatory elements and a pattern line collection for ectopic expression of target gene in specific tissue or at specific growth stage.
assessing inhibitory control in early‐stage alzheimer's and parkinson's disease using the hayling sentence completion test successful communication requires speakers to consider their listeners׳ perspectives. little is known about how this ability changes in alzheimer׳s disease (ad) although such knowledge could reveal the cognitive mechanisms fundamental to perspective-taking ability, and reveal which cognitive deficits are fundamental to communication disorders in ad. patients with mild to moderate ad and age and education matched controls were tested in a communicative perspective-taking task, and on measures of executive control, general cognitive functioning, and lexical retrieval. patients׳ ability to perform the perspective-taking task was significantly correlated with performance on measures of general cognitive functioning, visual scanning and construction, response conflict and attention. measures of lexical retrieval tended not to be correlated with performance on the communication task with one exception: semantic but not letter fluency predicted a derived score of perspective-taking ability. these findings broaden our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective taking, and suggest that impairments in perspective taking in ad occur during utterance planning, and at a relatively early processing stage which involves rapid visual scanning and problem solving, rather than during retrieval of lexical items needed to speak. more broadly, these data reveal executive function and semantic deficits, but not problems with lexical retrieval, as more fundamental to the basis of cognitive changes associated with ad.
multiple mechanisms for processing reward uncertainty in the primate basal forebrain it has been suggested that the basal forebrain (bf) exerts strong influences on the formation of memory and behavior. however, what information is used for the memory-behavior formation is unclear. we found that a population of neurons in the medial bf (medial septum and diagonal band of broca) of macaque monkeys encodes a unique combination of information: reward uncertainty, expected reward value, anticipation of punishment, and unexpected reward and punishment. the results were obtained while the monkeys were expecting (often with uncertainty) a rewarding or punishing outcome during a pavlovian procedure, or unexpectedly received an outcome outside the procedure. in vivo anterograde tracing using manganese-enhanced mri suggested that the major recipient of these signals is the intermediate hippocampal formation. based on these findings, we hypothesize that the medial bf identifies various contexts and outcomes that are critical for memory processing in the hippocampal formation.
bifactor modeling and the estimation of model-based reliability in the wais-iv the present study examined the factor structure of the wechsler adult intelligence scale--fourth edition (wais-iv; d. wechsler, 2008a) standardization sample using exploratory factor analysis, multiple factor extraction criteria, and higher order exploratory factor analysis (j. schmid & j. m. leiman, 1957) not included in the wais-iv technical and interpretation manual (d. wechsler, 2008b). results indicated that the wais-iv subtests were properly associated with the theoretically proposed first-order factors, but all but one factor-extraction criterion recommended extraction of one or two factors. hierarchical exploratory analyses with the schmid and leiman procedure found that the second-order g factor accounted for large portions of total and common variance, whereas the four first-order factors accounted for small portions of total and common variance. it was concluded that the wais-iv provides strong measurement of general intelligence, and clinical interpretation should be primarily at that level.
light-induced migration of retinal microglia into the subretinal space. this study determined the minimum cyclic (12l:12d) light intensity which produces retinal damage in albino (sprague-dawley) rats raised from birth to 15 weeks of age under 6 lx (12l:12d). four experimental light intensities were tested, viz. 1345, 270, 130 and 65 lx. control animals remained under 6 lx. after various durations of exposure to one of the intensities tested, the retinas of groups of six rats were evaluated for physiological and morphological evidence of light damage. the indices of damage were: (1) histological and morphometric changes in the retina, and (2) changes in the amplitude and latency of the b-wave of the electroretinogram. light intensities of 1345- or 270 lx severely damage retinas of albino rats raised from birth under 6 lx within 3-7 days of the initiation of light exposure. exposure to 130- or 65 lx produced much less dramatic changes in the responsiveness and morphology of the retina that did not appear to be permanent. based on these results, a reasonable estimate for the threshold cyclic-light intensity which produces damage to retinas of albino rats raised under 6 lx lies between 65- and 130 lx, or slightly more than 1 log unit above the light intensity under which the animals were raised. the effects of an animal's light history on retinal susceptibility to light damage are discussed.
the effect of orthognathic surgery on osteoprotegerin as immunological caliper of bone healing fracture healing is an ordered process that restores the structural integrity of the bone. soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb (srank), its ligand (srankl) and osteoprotegerin (opg) are involved in bone remodelling, thus they may play a role in fracture repair. opg, soluble rank and rankl levels were measured in plasma and in drainage fluid, collected from pre-surgery phase to healing in ten patients of both genders (age range 26–65 years) with proximal humerus fracture needing osteosynthesis. all patients showed fracture healing. no significant modifications in the concentrations of srankl and opg were observed, while srank showed a significant increase in drainage fluid 24 hours post-surgery compared with intra-surgery time. opg levels were higher in plasma and drainage fluid than srank and srankl at each time point. since there are no published data about srank involvement in fracture healing, our study represents the first preliminary indication about a local increase of this marker concentration immediately after surgery.
activation of cardiac fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 causes left ventricular hypertrophy. chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with ckd. elevated levels of fgf23 have been linked to greater risks of lvh and mortality in patients with ckd, but whether these risks represent causal effects of fgf23 is unknown. here, we report that elevated fgf23 levels are independently associated with lvh in a large, racially diverse ckd cohort. fgf23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via fgf receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-nfat signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for fgf23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. intramyocardial or intravenous injection of fgf23 in wild-type mice resulted in lvh, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated fgf23 levels and lvh. in an established animal model of ckd, treatment with an fgf-receptor blocker attenuated lvh, although no change in blood pressure was observed. these results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for fgf23 in the pathogenesis of lvh and suggest that chronically elevated fgf23 levels contribute directly to high rates of lvh and mortality in individuals with ckd.
usefulness of laboratory data in the management of right iliac fossa pain in adults background studies have shown that c-reactive protein (crp) and total leucocyte count (wbc) in suspected acute appendicitis analysed only on admission gave valuable information to guide the surgeon. the aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of crp and wbc measured repetitively before operation.   methods during a 1-year period 227 patients were studied before emergency appendicectomy. crp and wbc were analysed every 4th h. the upper limits of the reference intervals used were 9.0 x 10(9)/l for wbc and 10 mg/l for crp.   results of the 227 appendicectomized patients, 170 (75%) had acute appendicitis. sixty-six of the patients were tested on two or more occasions every 4th h. forty-six of these patients had appendicitis; repetitive tests showed a continuing rise in crp values but a continuing decrease in wbc. the negative appendicectomy rate among these 66 patients was 30%, which theoretically would have fallen to 19% if patients with normal results had not been subjected to surgery.   conclusions repeated laboratory tests for crp and wbc should be performed in patients with suspected acute appendicitis requested to stay for further observation. if these test results are normal, the surgeon should preferably refrain from operating but consider other differential diagnoses.
genetics of sleep disorders. neurons containing the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus and send axons to numerous regions throughout the central nervous system, including the major nuclei implicated in sleep regulation. here, we report that, by behavioral and electroencephalographic criteria, orexin knockout mice exhibit a phenotype strikingly similar to human narcolepsy patients, as well as canarc-1 mutant dogs, the only known monogenic model of narcolepsy. moreover, modafinil, an anti-narcoleptic drug with ill-defined mechanisms of action, activates orexin-containing neurons. we propose that orexin regulates sleep/wakefulness states, and that orexin knockout mice are a model of human narcolepsy, a disorder characterized primarily by rapid eye movement (rem) sleep dysregulation.
kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus induces the atm and h2ax dna damage response early during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells, which play roles in latency establishment abstract the dna damage response (ddr) of host cells is utilized by a number of viruses to establish and propagate their genomes in the infected cells. we examined the expression of the ddr genes during kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the genes were mostly downregulated, except h2ax, which was upregulated during infection. h2ax is important for gammaherpesvirus infectivity, and its phosphorylation at serine 139 is crucial for maintenance of latency during mouse gamma-herpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) infection. we now also observed phosphorylation of h2ax at serine 139 during kshv infection. h2ax is a histone h2a isoform shown to interact with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) encoded by kshv. here, we show that lana directly interacted with h2ax through domains at both its n and c termini. the phosphorylated form of h2ax (γh2ax) was shown to colocalize with lana. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays showed that a reduction in h2ax levels resulted in reduced binding of lana with kshv terminal repeats (trs). binding preferences of h2ax and γh2ax along the kshv episome were examined by whole-episome chip analysis. we showed that γh2ax had a higher relative binding activity along the tr regions than that of the long unique region (lur), which highlighted the importance of h2ax phosphorylation during kshv infection. furthermore, knockdown of h2ax resulted in decreased kshv episome copy number. notably, the c terminus of lana contributed to phosphorylation of h2ax. however, phosphorylation was not dependent on the ability of lana to drive kshv-infected cells into s-phase. thus, h2ax contributes to association of lana with the trs, and phosphorylation of h2ax is likely important for its increased density at the trs.
a simulation study into the performance of "optimal" diagnostic thresholds in the population:"large" effect sizes are not enough. when investigating the effects of potential prognostic or risk factors that have been measured on a quantitative scale, values of these factors are often categorized into two groups. sometimes an 'optimal' cutpoint is chosen that gives the best separation in terms of a two-sample test statistic. it is well known that this approach leads to a serious inflation of the type i error and to an overestimation of the effect of the prognostic or risk factor in absolute terms. in this paper, we illustrate that the resulting confidence intervals are similarly affected. we show that the application of a shrinkage procedure to correct for bias, together with bootstrap resampling for estimating the variance, yields confidence intervals for the effect of a potential prognostic or risk factor with the desired coverage.
taurine release by astrocytes modulates osmosensitive glycine receptor tone and excitability in the adult supraoptic nucleus whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from isolated rat supraoptic nucleus magnocellular neurosecretory cells (mncs). under current clamping, hyperosmolality produced by the addition of 10-30 mm mannitol depolarized each of 25 cells tested. in contrast, reducing fluid osmolality from 295 to 265 mosmol/kgh2o had the reverse effect, hyperpolarizing 18 of 21 mncs. voltage-clamp recordings in 43 cells revealed that the effects of hypo- and hyperosmolality, respectively, were caused by decreases and increases in a nonselective cation conductance reversing near -41 mv. current-voltage analysis in na(+)-free solution revealed that the reversal potentials of currents elicited by increases and decreases in osmolality both shifted to a value near -90 mv, suggesting that a single ionic conductance is modulated by these stimuli. the relation between cationic conductance and osmolality was specific, sensitive (+2.14%.mosmol-1.kgh2o-1), and well-fit by linear regression (r = 0.96; n = 22 cells) between 275 and 325 mosmol/kgh2o. these results indicate that mncs express a depolarizing current that is active under steady-state conditions and that the up- or downregulation of this current contributes to the excitation or inhibition of these cells upon acute exposure to hypo- or hyperosmolar conditions.
differential responsiveness to 17β-estradiol of mesenchymal stem cells from postmenopausal women between osteoporosis and osteoarthritis the aim of this study was to compare the osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) from bone marrow between postmenopausal women with osteoarthritis (oa) and osteoporosis (op). mscs of the proximal femur from oa and op donors were cultured under control and different experimental mediums. after verifying the availability of primary cells, their osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin were compared between two groups. similar patterns of cell growth were shown in both oa and op groups. however, after the sixth passage, the viability of undifferentiated cells decreased more in op than in oa donors. under the same osteogenic supplements condition, the mrna expression of osteogenesis‐specific genes, osteocalcin (oc) and alkaline phosphatase (alp) were higher in oa group. comparison of bone matrix mineralization was parallel to that of mrna expression. the level of bone‐specific alp (bap) was higher in cells from donors with oa, whereas osteoprotegerin (opg) was higher in op group. this difference in bap expression proved to be insignificant after the administration of leptin. although leptin upregulated the expression of opg, a significant difference still existed between oa and op. in conclusion, differential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mscs were noted between postmenopausal women with oa and op. differential biological behavior of mscs seems to be partly related to the different distribution of bone mass between oa and op populations. © 2009 orthopaedic research society. published by wiley periodicals, inc. j orthop res 27: 1067–1073, 2009
laparoscopic extended liver resection: are postoperative outcomes different? background left hepatic trisectionectomy is the most extended hepatic resection. to date, few data are available on longterm outcomes after this operation.   study design between june 1998 and july 2004, a total of 52 patients underwent left trisectionectomy for primary or secondary hepatobiliary tumors at our institution. data were analyzed with regard to patient characteristics, intraoperative details, pathologic findings, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and outcomes as determined by survival.   results left trisectionectomy was combined with caudate lobectomy and hilar lymph node dissection in 29 and 35 patients, respectively. in addition, 43 procedures were performed in 31 patients: resection of hilar bifurcation (n = 15), bile-duct revision (n = 5), wedge resection of segment vi/vii (n = 10), gastrectomy (n = 1), and resection or reconstruction of hepatic vessels or the inferior vena cava (n = 12). operative morbidity and mortality were 50% and 11.9%, respectively. by multivariate analysis, additional operative procedures constituted the only positive predictor of postoperative morbidity. one-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 65%, 52%, and 33%, respectively. after r0 resection (n = 37), 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 78%, 68%, and 44% compared with 38%, 15%, and 7% after r1 resection (p = 0.0004). survival corresponding to the four most frequent tumor types (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal metastases) was comparable with survival data reported in the literature after less-extensive resections.   conclusions left trisectionectomy provides acceptable survival rates in both locally advanced primary hepatobiliary malignancies and large metastatic liver tumors. despite major progress in surgical technique and perioperative management, left trisectionectomy is still associated with higher operative mortality and morbidity than less-extensive resections. because selection criteria for this type of procedure are not clearly defined, particular attention should be focused on the oncologic benefits when considering this operation.
global genome response of escherichia coli o157∶h7 sakai during dynamic changes in growth kinetics induced by an abrupt temperature downshift an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was undertaken to determine the physiological response of escherichia coli o157:h7 sakai to steady-state conditions relevant to low temperature and water activity conditions experienced during meat carcass chilling in cold air. the response of e. coli during exponential growth at 25 °c aw 0.985, 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967 was compared with that of a reference culture (35 °c aw 0.993). gene and protein expression profiles of e. coli were more strongly affected by low water activity (aw 0.967) than by low temperature (14 °c). predefined group enrichment analysis revealed that a universal response of e. coli to all test conditions included activation of the master stress response regulator rpos and the rcs phosphorelay system involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid, as well as down-regulation of elements involved in chemotaxis and motility. however, colanic acid-deficient mutants were shown to achieve comparable growth rates to their wild-type parents under all conditions, indicating that colanic acid is not required for growth. in contrast to the transcriptomic data, the proteomic data revealed that several processes involved in protein synthesis were down-regulated in overall expression at 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967. this result suggests that during growth under these conditions, e. coli, although able to transcribe the required mrna, may lack the cellular resources required for translation. elucidating the global adaptive response of e. coli o157:h7 during exposure to chilling and water activity stress has provided a baseline of knowledge of the physiology of this pathogen.
neurophysiological correlates of depressive symptoms in young adults: a quantitative eeg study in previous quantitative eeg studies of depression, mostly patients with a lifetime history of depressive disorders were reported. this study examined quantitative eeg parameters obtained in the early stages of depression in comparison with age-matched healthy controls. eeg was recorded using two different montages in eyes closed and eyes open resting states. a significant increase in spectrum power in theta (4–7.5 hz), alpha (7.5–14 hz), and beta (14–20 hz) frequency bands was found in depressed patients at parietal and occipital sites, both in eyes closed and eyes open conditions. these results suggest that an increase in slow (theta and alpha) activity in the eeg pattern may reflect a decreased cortical activation in these brain regions. enhancement of beta power may correlate with anxiety symptoms that most likely play an important role on the onset of depressive disorder.
the saccharomyces cerevisiae histone chaperone rtt106 mediates the cell cycle recruitment of swi/snf and rsc to the hir-dependent histone genes genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved swi/snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates. the mechanism by which this complex is targeted to specific chromosomal loci remains unknown. we show that swi/snf is required for expression of the yeast histone hta1-htb1 locus because of the role of hir1p and hir2p corepressors in negatively regulating transcription. snf5p, snf2p/swi2p, and swi3p, three components of the yeast swi/snf complex, coimmunoprecipitate with each hir protein, and snf5p is maximally associated with the hta1-htb1 promoter when the hir-based repression system is intact and the swi/snf complex is functional. the data support a role for the hir repressors in the gene-specific targeting of swi/snf.
developmental regulation of dna replication initiation in drosophila a cluster of drosophila melanogaster chorion genes at locus 66d on the third chromosome amplifies 60-fold in the ovarian follicle cells prior to the onset of gene expression. a 3.8-kilobase (kb) region of the gene cluster can induce tissue-specific amplification in transformants. previous models postulated that amplification is activated in follicle cells by transcription of one of the two chorion genes (s15 and s18) located within the 3.8-kb essential region. in this study, we showed that neither s15 nor s18 chorion gene transcription was required for amplification. however, a 510-bp region upstream from s18 contained sequences essential for both amplification and s18 transcription. no other region within the 3.8-kb fragment was required for amplification. we propose that upstream transcription control elements rather than transcription per se are involved in controlling amplification during development.
class-modeling analysis reveals t-cell homeostasis disturbances involved in loss of immune control in elite controllers background human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) elite controllers are able to control virus replication to levels below the limits of detection by commercial assays, but the actual level of viremia in these individuals is not well defined. here, we quantify plasma hiv-1 rna in elite controllers and correlate this with specific immunologic parameters.   methods plasma hiv-1 rna levels were quantified in 90 elite controllers with use of a real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay with a sensitivity of 0.2 copies/ml. hiv-1-specific immune responses and longitudinal cd4(+) t cell counts were examined.   results the median plasma hiv-1 rna level was 2 copies/ml (interquartile range, 0.2-14 copies/ml). a longitudinal analysis of 31 elite controllers demonstrated 2-5-fold fluctuations in viremia in the majority of individuals; 6 had persistent levels below 1 copy/ml. viremia correlated directly with hiv-1-specific neutralizing antibodies and western blot reactivity but not with cd8(+) t cell responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell decrease was more common among individuals with detectable viremia (p = .04).   conclusions low-level viremia is present in the majority of elite controllers and is associated with higher hiv-1-specific antibody responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell loss is more common among viremic individuals, suggesting that even very low-level viremia has negative consequences over time.
stimulus disparity and punisher control of human signal-detection performance. three experiments using human participants varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers or point-loss punishers in two-alternative signal-detection procedures. experiment 1 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses (group a) and point-loss punishers for errors (group b) across conditions. response bias varied systematically as a function of the relative reinforcer or punisher frequencies. experiment 2 arranged two conditions - one where an unequal ratio of reinforcement (5ratio1 or 1ratio5) was presented without punishment (r-only), and another where the same reinforcer ratio was presented with an equal distribution of point-loss punishers (r+p). response bias was significantly greater in the r-only condition than the r+p condition, supporting a subtractive model of punishment. experiment 3 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses across four unequal reinforcer ratios (5ratio1, 2ratio1, 1ratio2, 1ratio5) both without (r-only) and with (r+p) an equal distribution of point-loss punishers for errors. response bias varied systematically with changes in relative reinforcer frequency for both r-only and r+p conditions, with 5 out of 8 participants showing increases in sensitivity estimates from r-only to r+p conditions. overall, the results indicated that punishers have similar but opposite effects to reinforcers in detection procedures and that combined reinforcer and punisher effects might be better modeled by a subtractive punishment model than an additive punishment model, consistent with research using concurrent-schedule choice procedures.
bacterial n2-fixation in mangrove ecosystems: insights from a diazotroph–mangrove interaction trichodesmium spp. have proved to be enigmatic organisms, and their ecology and physiology are unusual among diazotrophs. recent research shows that they can simultaneously fix n2 and take up combined nitrogen. the co-occurrence of these two processes is thought to be incompatible, but they could be obligatory in trichodesmium spp. if only a small fraction of cells within a colony or along a filament are capable of n2 fixation. combined nitrogen is released from cells during periods of active growth and n2 fixation, and concomitantly taken up by trichodesmium spp. or cells living in association with colonies. although the nitrogenase of trichodesmium spp. is affected by high concentrations of combined nitrogen, it might be relatively less sensitive to low concentrations of combined nitrogen typical of the oligotrophic ocean and culture conditions. nitrogenase activity and synthesis exhibits an endogenous rhythm in trichodesmium spp. cultures, which is affected by the addition of nitrogen.
