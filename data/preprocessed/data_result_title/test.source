prevalence rates of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and psychiatric comorbidity among adolescents in iran. we conducted a household survey of 3,012 adults aged 18 and over in order to estimate the prevalence of dsm-iv obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) in urban areas in konya, turkey. trained psychiatry interns administered the 2.1 version of the ocd section of the composite international diagnostic interview (cidi). the 12-month period prevalence rate of ocd was 3.0%. the mean age of onset of ocd was 25.9 +/- 12.5 (range, 7 to 63) years. the prevalence rate of ocd was slightly higher among females (males 2.5%, females 3.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant. the relative risk for divorced, separated, or widowed subjects was approximately 4.2 times higher for ocd than others (2.7% v 10.5%). the 1-year prevalence of ocd inversely related to age group in male subjects, but increased with age in female subjects. the prevalence rate of ocd was not different by the level of education, except it was statistically higher among subjects who were literate but had no schooling, of which the causal relationship was high prevalence rate of ocd among female literate-but no schooling subjects. subjects with few (one or two) and more siblings (seven or more) had a significantly higher prevalence rate of ocd than subjects with moderate numbers of siblings (three to six). no significant difference was found according to employment, fertility, birth order, and income of the subjects. about 30% of subjects with ocd had only obsessions, whereas 68.5% had both obsessions and compulsions. only one subject (1.1%) with ocd met compulsion criteria without obsessions. the prevalence rate of ocd we found in konya, turkey was similar to the prevalence rates of most epidemiological studies.
potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in the developing rat brain. physiological cell death (pcd), a process by which redundant or unsuccessful neurons are deleted by apoptosis (cell suicide) from the developing central nervous system, has been recognized as a natural phenomenon for many years. whether environmental factors can interact with pcd mechanisms to increase the number of neurons undergoing pcd, thereby converting this natural phenomenon into a pathological process, is an interesting question for which new answers are just now becoming available. in a series of recent studies we have shown that 2 major classes of drugs (those that block nmda glutamate receptors and those that promote gabaa receptor activation), when administered to immature rodents during the period of synaptogenesis, trigger widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the developing brain. in addition, we have found that ethanol, which has both nmda antagonist and gabamimetic properties, triggers a robust pattern of apoptotic neurodegeneration, thereby deleting large numbers of neurons from many different regions of the developing brain. these findings provide a more likely explanation than has heretofore been available for the reduced brain mass and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human fetal alcohol syndrome (fas). the period of synaptogenesis, also known as the brain growth spurt period, occurs in different species at different times relative to birth. in rats and mice it is a postnatal event, but in humans it extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. thus, there is a period in pre‐ and postnatal human development, lasting for several years, during which immature cns neurons are prone to commit suicide if exposed to intoxicating concentrations of drugs with nmda antagonist or gabamimetic properties. these findings are important, not only because of their relevance to the fas, but because there are many agents in the human environment, other than ethanol, that have nmda antagonist or gabamimetic properties. such agents include drugs that may be abused by pregnant mothers (ethanol, phencyclidine [angel dust], ketamine [special k], nitrous oxide [laughing gas], barbiturates, benzodiazepines), and many medicinals used in obstetric and pediatric neurology (anticonvulsants), and anesthesiology (all general anesthetics are either nmda antagonists or gabamimetics).
effects of ethylene on secondary xylem formation in arabidopsis thaliana the plant hormone ethylene is an important signal in plant growth responses to environmental cues. in vegetative growth, ethylene is generally considered as a regulator of cell expansion, but a role in the control of meristem growth has also been suggested based on pharmacological experiments and ethylene-overproducing mutants. in this study, we used transgenic ethylene-insensitive and ethylene-overproducing hybrid aspen (populus tremula × tremuloides) in combination with experiments using an ethylene perception inhibitor [1-methylcyclopropene (1-mcp)] to demonstrate that endogenous ethylene produced in response to leaning stimulates cell division in the cambial meristem. this ethylene-controlled growth gives rise to the eccentricity of populus stems that is formed in association with tension wood.
economic evaluation of sequencing strategies in her2-positive metastatic breast cancer in mexico: a contrast between public and private payer perspectives abstractpurpose based on available phase iii trial data, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of different treatment strategies that can be used in patients with newly diagnosed her2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mbc).patients and methodswe constructed a markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of four different her2 targeted treatment sequences in patients with her2-positive mbc treated in the u.s. the model followed patients weekly over their remaining life expectancies. health states considered were progression-free survival (pfs) 1st to 3rd lines, and death. transitional probabilities were based on published phase iii trials. cost data (2015 us dollars) were captured from the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) drug payment table and physician fee schedule. health utility data were extracted from published studies. the outcomes considered were pfs, os, costs, qalys, the incremental cost per qaly gained ratio, and the net monetary benefit. deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the uncertainty around key model parameters and their joint impact on the base-case results.resultsthe combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel (thp) as first-line therapy, trastuzumab emtansine (t-dm1) as second-line therapy, and lapatinib/capecitabine third-line resulted in 1.81 qalys, at a cost of $335,231.35. the combination of trastuzumab/docetaxel as first line without subsequent t-dm1 or pertuzumab yielded 1.41 qalys, at a cost of $175,240.69. the least clinically effective sequence (1.27 qalys), but most cost-effective at a total cost of $149,250.19, was trastuzumab/docetaxel as first-line therapy, t-dm1 as second-line therapy, and trastuzumab/lapatinib as third-line therapy.conclusionour results suggest that thp as first-line therapy, followed by t-dm1 as second-line therapy, would require at least a 50 % reduction in the total drug acquisition cost for it to be considered a cost-effective strategy.
luminal b subtype: a key factor for the worse prognosis of young breast cancer patients in china background breast cancer rarely occurs in young women. our knowledge about disease presentation, prognosis and treatment effects are largely dependent upon older series.   materials and methods we evaluated biological features and stage at presentation for 1427 consecutive premenopausal patients aged < or = 50 years with first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer referred to surgery at the european institute of oncology from april 1997 to august 2000. a total of 185 patients (13%) were aged < 35 years ('very young') and 1242 (87%) were aged 35-50 years ('less young'). the expression of estrogen receptors (er), progesterone receptors (pgr), presence of vascular invasion (vi), grading (g), expression of ki-67, her2/neu overexpression, pathological stage according to tnm staging system (ptnm), pathological tumor size and number of axillary lymph node involvement were evaluated.   results compared with less young patients, the very young patient group had a higher percentage of tumors classified as er negative (p < 0.001), pgr negative (p = 0.001), higher expression of ki-67 > or = 20% of cells stained; 62.2% versus 53%, (p < 0.001), vascular or lymphatic invasion (48.6% versus 37.3%, p = 0.006), and pathological grade 3 (p < 0.0001). there was no difference between the two groups for pt, pathological tumor size (pn) and number of positive lymph nodes.   conclusions we conclude that compared with less young premenopausal patients, very young women have a greater chance of having an endocrine-unresponsive tumor, and are more likely to present with a higher grade, more extensively proliferating and vessel invading disease. pathological tumor size, nodal status and number of positive axillary lymph-nodes have a similar distribution among the younger and the older cohorts, thus not supporting previous data indicating more advanced disease in younger patients at diagnosis of operable disease.
influence of sediment composition on pah toxicity using zebrafish (danio rerio) and japanese medaka (oryzias latipes) embryo-larval assays neuroactive small molecules are indispensable tools for treating mental illnesses and dissecting nervous system function. however, it has been difficult to discover novel neuroactive drugs. here, we describe a high—throughput (ht) behavior—based approach to neuroactive small molecule discovery in the zebrafish. we use automated screening assays to evaluate thousands of chemical compounds and find that diverse classes of neuroactive molecules cause distinct patterns of behavior. these `behavioral barcodes' can be used to rapidly identify novel psychotropic chemicals and to predict their molecular targets. for example, we identify novel acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors using phenotypic comparisons and computational techniques. by combining ht screening technologies with behavioral phenotyping in vivo, behavior—based chemical screens may accelerate the pace of neuroactive drug discovery and provide small—molecule tools for understanding vertebrate behavior.
gorillas with white sclera: a naturally occurring variation in a morphological trait linked to social cognitive functions making eye contact is the most powerful mode of establishing a communicative link between humans. during their first year of life, infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others conveys significant information. two experiments were carried out to demonstrate special sensitivity to direct eye contact from birth. the first experiment tested the ability of 2- to 5-day-old newborns to discriminate between direct and averted gaze. in the second experiment, we measured 4-month-old infants' brain electric activity to assess neural processing of faces when accompanied by direct (as opposed to averted) eye gaze. the results show that, from birth, human infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze. the exceptionally early sensitivity to mutual gaze demonstrated in these studies is arguably the major foundation for the later development of social skills.
neurone specific enolase (nse) in small cell lung cancer: a tumour marker of prognostic significance? among lung cancers small cell carcinoma is the most sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. this has emphasised the importance of an accurate diagnosis of this cell type, and the present study examined the use of serum neurone specific enolase (nse) as a diagnostic marker for small cell carcinoma. nse was measured in pretreatment sera from 103 patients with small cell carcinoma and in sera from relevant controls, including patients with other lung cancers, non-malignant lung diseases, and healthy adults. serum nse concentration was raised (greater than 25 ng/ml) in 72% of patients with small cell carcinoma. ninety one per cent of patients with extensive disease and 50% of patients with limited disease were serum nse positive. patients with extensive disease in general had higher serum nse concentrations than patients with limited disease. no definite difference in serum nse positivity could be shown between oat cell and intermediate cell subtypes. out of 51 patients with other lung cancers, four (8%) had a raised serum concentration, whereas all patients with non-malignant diseases and healthy individuals had normal serum nse concentrations. serum nse determination seems to be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.
evaluation of the association of pik3ca mutations and pten loss with efficacy of trastuzumab therapy in metastatic breast cancer background in an attempt to identify markers of resistance to trastuzumab, we evaluated both the profiling of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-positive tumor cells measuring the relative levels of egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten and their correlations with clinical outcome in her2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab.   patients and methods tumor tissues for this retrospective analysis were available from 45 out of 76 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated from april 1999 to march 2006 with trastuzumab-based therapy at our institution. evaluations of egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status by immunohistochemistry (ihc) were carried out on all 45 tissue samples and their correlations with response to trastuzumab, incidence of central nervous system (cns) metastases, time to progression (ttp), overall survival from diagnosis of breast cancer (os1), from diagnosis of metastatic disease (os2) and from the start of trastuzumab (os3) were analyzed.   results we observed that ttp (p = 0.001) and median os2 and os3 were significantly longer in patients responsive to trastuzumab-based regimen compared with nonresponsive patients. egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status by ihc were not significantly associated with response to trastuzumab, ttp, overall survival (os1, os2, os3) and cns metastases incidence. a trend for shorter os3 was observed for pmapk-positive patients compared with pmapk-negative patients (22.8 versus 31.2 months; p = 0.076). median os1 resulted shorter in 22 pakt-positive patients (69.8 months) compared with 23 pakt-negative patients (108.2 months); p = 0.091. it is likely that high expression of pmapk (pmapk-positive status) or pakt (pakt-positive status) could identify a subgroup of her2-positive tumors with high activity of proliferation and survival pathways and with resistance to trastuzumab.   conclusions in her2-positive metastatic breast cancers, egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status evaluated by ihc was not significantly associated with response to trastuzumab, ttp, os and cns metastases incidence. however, her2 status determined by ihc and/or fish assays may not be sufficient to predict response to trastuzumab-based therapy.
chianina beef tenderness investigated through integrated omics. within a population of charolais young bulls, two extreme groups of longissimus thoracis muscle samples, classified according to warner-bratzler shear force (wbsf) of 55 degrees c grilled meat, were analyzed by 2d-electrophoresis. muscle analyses were performed on 4 bulls of the "tender" group (wbsf=27.7+/-4.8 n) and 4 bulls of the "tough" group (wbsf=41.2+/-6.1 n), at 3 post-mortem times: d0, samples taken within 10 min post-mortem; d5 and d21, samples kept at 4 degrees c under vacuum during 5 and 21 days. proteins of muscle samples were separated in two fractions based on protein solubility in tris buffer: "soluble" and "insoluble". proteins of both fractions were separated by 2d-electrophoresis. evolution of spots during the 3 post-mortem times was analyzed by hierarchical classification (hca). three clusters of proteins presenting similar evolution profiles provided accurate classification of post-mortem times and showed the translocation of some chaperone proteins and glycolytic enzymes from the soluble fraction to the insoluble fraction between d0 and d5. cellular structure dismantlement and proteolysis was observed at d21. effect of group ("tender" vs "tough") on spot intensities was tested by anova. at d0, higher quantity of proteins of the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria was found in the tender group suggesting a more extensive degradation of mitochondria that may be related to the apoptotic process.
the complexity of conservative valued csps in the constraint satisfaction problem ($csp$), the aim is to find an assignment of values to a set of variables subject to specified constraints. in the minimum cost homomorphism problem ($minhom$), one is additionally given weights $c_{va}$ for every variable $v$ and value $a$, and the aim is to find an assignment $f$ to the variables that minimizes $\sum_{v} c_{vf(v)}$. let $minhom(\gamma)$ denote the $minhom$ problem parameterized by the set of predicates allowed for constraints. $minhom(\gamma)$ is related to many well-studied combinatorial optimization problems, and concrete applications can be found in, for instance, defence logistics and machine learning. we show that $minhom(\gamma)$ can be studied by using algebraic methods similar to those used for csps. with the aid of algebraic techniques, we classify the computational complexity of $minhom(\gamma)$ for all choices of $\gamma$. our result settles a general dichotomy conjecture previously resolved only for certain classes of directed graphs, [gutin, hell, rafiey, yeo, european j. of combinatorics, 2008].
deciding the fate of supernumerary frozen embryos: parents' choices human embryos can only be stored in the first instance for 3 years in western australia, according to the west australian reproductive technology act. thereafter, an application must be made to the local regulatory body, the reproductive technology council, for an extension. of the 650 batches of embryos frozen between 8 april 1993 and 31 october 1995, 170 (26.2%) batches were still in storage after 2.5 years. a reminding letter was sent at this time to the couples to whom the embryos belonged, i.e. 6 months before the expiry of the initial storage period, asking for clarification of what was to be done with the embryos. a large proportion of patients (64.7%) chose to either extend the storage period or thaw and transfer the embryos. curiously, more batches of embryos were discarded (18.8%) than donated to other couples (5.9%). contact with the patients was lost in a small but significant proportion of cases; more of these had been unsuccessful in their treatment (20.4%) than had achieved a pregnancy (4.3%).
modeling of the wrinkling of premixed turbulent flames in the thin reaction zones regime for large eddy simulation by abstract a consistent formulation of the g -equation approach for les is developed. the unfiltered g equation is valid only at the instantaneous flame front location. hence, in a filtering procedure applied to derive the appropriate les equation, only the instantaneous unfiltered flame surface can be considered. a new filter kernel is provided, which averages along the flame surface. the filter kernel is used to derive the g equation for the filtered flame front location. this equation has two unclosed terms, involving a flame front conditional averaged flow velocity, and a filtered propagation term. a model for the conditional velocity is derived, expressing this quantity in terms of the favre-filtered flow velocity, which is typically known from a flow solver. this model leads to the appearance of a density ratio in the propagation term of the g equation. les of combustion in the thin reaction zones regime is discussed in the les regime diagram. a new line is identified separating the thin reaction zones regime into two parts, where the broadened flame thickness is larger and smaller than the filter size, respectively. a model for the propagation term is provided. this leads to a term including the subfilter turbulent burning velocity and an additional term proportional to the resolved flame front curvature. for the former, an algebraic model is provided from an equation for the subfilter flame front wrinkling. the latter term depends on the inverse of the subfilter damkohler number and disappears in the corrugated flamelets regime.
a one-year prospective study of refractory status epilepticus in modena, italy purpose:  status epilepticus (se) that is resistant to two antiepileptic compounds is defined as refractory status epilepticus (rse). in the few available retrospective studies, estimated rse frequency is between 31% and 43% of patients presenting an se episode; almost all seem to require a coma induction for treatment. we prospectively assessed rse frequency, clinical predictors, and outcome in a tertiary clinical setting.
morphological changes of paulownia seedlings infected phytoplasmas reveal the genes associated with witches' broom through aflp and msap recent research has demonstrated that dna methylation plays an integral role in regulating the timing of flowering and in endosperm development. the identification of key genes controlling these processes, the expression of which is altered in plants with low methylation, opens the way to understanding how dna methylation regulates plant development.
dental functional status with and without tooth replacement in a chinese adult population purpose to review the influence of prosthodontic and dental implant treatment on patient satisfaction and oral health-related quality of life (ohqol) based on a systematic search of the literature.   materials and methods a systematic literature search was carried out for articles published between 1960 and february 2003. details of the search process and results were reported in part 1 of the study (int j prosthodont2004;17:83-93). the included studies were categorized and evaluated according to their level of evidence, following the guidelines of the agency for health care policy and research. the characteristics and content of the studies were analyzed and tabulated.   results among the 114 included studies, there were 76 publications reaching evidence level iii. the results showed that the effects of compromised oral health are not limited to traditional clinical aspects, but can considerably affect patients in various activities of daily life. twenty-four of the 38 investigations with evidence levels i and ii dealt with implant stabilization of complete mandibular prostheses, comparing implant prostheses to conventional complete dentures. fully edentulous patients experience negative impacts on ohqol from their condition. they benefit significantly from the use of dental implants to support mandibular prostheses. however, support by more than 2 implants does not appear to further significantly increase patient satisfaction and ohqol.   conclusions to date, research in the field of patient-based outcomes has concentrated on dental implant treatment for the edentulous patient. other prosthetic treatments such as single crowns, fixed and removable partial dentures, or further treatment concepts (eg, the shortened dental arch concept) are not well represented. the use of patient-centered outcome measures can help to find an individual, patient-oriented prosthetic solution.
arrested demixing opens route to bigels we numerically investigate the competition between phase separation and dynamical arrest in a colloidal system interacting via a short-ranged attractive potential. equilibrium fluid configurations are quenched at two different temperatures below the critical temperature and followed during their time evolution. at the lowest studied t, the phase-separation process is interrupted by the formation of an attractive glass in the dense phase. at the higher t, no arrest is observed and the phase-separation process proceeds endlessly in the simulated time window. the final structure of the glass retains memory of the interrupted phase-separation process in the form of a frozen spinodal decomposition peak, whose location and amplitude is controlled by the average packing fraction. we also discuss the time evolution of the nonergodicity parameter, providing evidence of a progressively decreasing localization length on increasing the packing fraction. finally, we confirm that the reported results are independent of the microscopic dynamics.
family needs in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury from colombia, south america the responses to a questionnaire on subjective burden are reported for 52 primary caregivers of a group of persons with traumatic brain injuries sustained an average of 6 years previously. the aim of the study was to examine satisfaction with social support, perception of coping skills, and appraisal of symptoms as predictors of strain in the carers. a range of responses, both positive and negative, to the work of caring for a relative with a head injury was reported. a high prevalence rate of emotional and behavioural changes in the persons with head injuries was found and the amount of distress caused by these symptoms was found to be predictive of burden. the other factor important in predicting burden was the carers ratings of their satisfaction with their ability to cope with the work of caregiv ing. social support, injury severity, and the demographic characteristics of the persons with head injury and their carers were not significant predictors. depression in the carers was also investigated and the variable most predictive of elevated depression scores was coping satisfaction. these findings reinforce the importance of strengthening carers coping resources in rehabilitation work with head injured persons and their families.
interactive effects of selenium and mercury on the restoration potential of leaves of the medicinal plant, portulaca oleracea linn. abstract effects of sodium selenate and selenite on the toxic effect of methylmercuric chloride (mmc) on nervous tissue in culture were studied. sliced newborn rat cerebella were cultured in a medium containing mmc and selenate or selenite. the concentrations of sodium selenate and selenite that showed remarkable protective effect against the neurotoxicity of mmc were 0.8 and 0.2 × 10 −5 m , respectively. the protective effect of sodium selenite was additive with that of dl -α-tocopherol acetate (vitamin e). however, 4 × 10 −5 m sodium selenate and 1 × 10 −5 m sodium selenite per se showed an obvious toxic effect on the outgrowth of nerve fibers and cells from cerebellum tissue in culture. the toxicity of selenium was additive to that of mmc. these results indicate that oxidized selenium at low concentrations is able to modify the neurotoxicity of mmc and that different states of selenium produce different degrees of protection. they suggest further that the adverse effect of selenium is additive to the toxicity of alkyl mercurial at the toxic level of selenium.
key beliefs for targeted interventions to increase physical activity in children: analyzing data from an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour we examined predictors of leisure-time physical activity intention and behaviour in children, and the potential direct and moderating effects of gender and ethnicity. participants were 364 (230 asian; 134 caucasian) 9-11-year-old children who completed measures of the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) and physical activity behaviour (physical activity questionnaire for children) across three, 3-month intervals (i.e., two prediction time-periods) in canada. the tpb explained 35-50% of the variance in physical activity behaviour and 74-76% of the variance in intention using structural equation modelling. an autoregressive longitudinal path model showed that the tpb predicted changes in physical activity and physical activity predicted changes in tpb constructs (p<.05). overall, intention and perceived behavioural control were significant (p<.05) contributors to the direct prediction of behaviour and subjective norm and perceived behavioural control were significant (p<.05) predictors of intention. gender did not show a robust relationship with physical activity or intention, but the effect of ethnicity on physical activity was mediated through perceived behavioural control (asians less active than caucasians). finally, gender and ethnicity did not moderate tpb and physical activity relations (p<.05). these data suggest that childhood may be a formative stage for the development of physical activity cognitions and that promoting physical activity in children may require normative and control-based intervention.
effect of oral supplementation of putrescine and l-glutamine on the histomorphology of small intestine and growth performance in broiler chickens previous studies have shown that the feeding of putrescine, a biogenic amine and the precursor of the mammalian polyamines, can promote whole-body growth of chicks. the current study was undertaken to determine the effect of spermine, also a biogenic amine and the most cationic of the polyamines, under similar conditions. in exp. 1, 120 week-old chicks were fed purified crystalline amino acid-based diets containing 0, .2, .4, .6, .8, or 1.0% spermine for 14 d. spermine proved highly toxic and growth rates were reduced compared with controls when even .2% was fed. in exp. 2, chicks were fed 0, .0375, .0750, or .1000% spermine. these concentrations proved less toxic than those used in exp. 1. supplemental dietary cysteine was then provided at 0, .3, .6, and .9% together with 0, .025, .050, or .400% spermine (exp. 3) because depletion of cellular glutathione has been suggested as contributing to spermine's toxicity. even high levels of cysteine supplementation did not overcome spermine's toxicity. subsequent dietary provision of l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (otc, exp. 4), a cysteine prodrug, showed that depletion of cellular glutathione was not likely a cause of spermine toxicosis. a trend toward increased weight gain and feed efficiency was observed when low concentrations of spermine were fed. it was concluded, however, that dietary spermine was more toxic to chicks than was previously seen for putrescine, that any growth-promoting effects of dietary spermine are small, and that supplements of dietary cysteine or otc are unlikely to increase these effects by overcoming spermine toxicosis.
nos 2 regulation of lps-induced airway inflammation via s-nitrosylation of nf-b p 65 airway s-nitrosothiols (snos) are naturally occurring bronchodilators. snos, nitrate, and nitrite were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and mild pulmonary disease (aged 6-16 years) and 13 healthy children (aged 8-15 years). concentrations of snos were decreased in the lower airways of patients with cf and mild pulmonary disease (median, range: 0, 0-320 nmol/l vs 80, 0-970 nmol/l) despite normal levels of the inert nitric oxide metabolites nitrate and nitrite (mean +/- sem: 3.7 +/- 0.5 micromol/l vs 4.8 +/- 0.9 micromol/l). s-nitrosolation- mediated bioreactivities may be impaired by depletion of the cf airway sno reservoir.
inhibitory effect of the essential oil from chamaecyparis obtusa on the growth of food-borne pathogens essential oil from achillea fragrantissima exerted a bactericidic effect on several gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains, as well as on candida albicans. the oil was fractionated on sillica gel columns by a gradient of ether in petrol ether (30 degrees c-40 degrees c). two fractions which contained less polar compounds were active against c. albicans only. the fractions which contained more polar compounds inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms tested. one of these compounds was identified as terpinen-4-ol. commercial terpinen-4-ol had a similar antimicrobial activity.
surgical strategy for clinical stage i non-small cell lung cancer in octogenarians. background octogenarians often present with potentially resectable bronchogenic carcinoma. older reports noting prohibitive mortality and recent surveys documenting continued substantial risk raise concerns about the applicability of operation in this age group.   methods we reviewed the short-term and long-term results of pulmonary resection for intended cure of lung cancer in patients 80 years and older operated on from 1980 through 1995. our surgical philosophy favored lobectomy over lesser resection and generally avoided pneumonectomy in the elderly.   results fifty-four octogenarians underwent resection: 43 lobectomies, 2 extended lobectomies, 2 bilobectomies, 3 segmentectomies, 3 wedge excisions, and 1 pneumonectomy. there were two perioperative deaths (3.7%). the overall nonfatal complication rate was 42%, with a major complication rate of 11%. postoperative stay decreased from 8.1 days overall to 6.3 days in the last 3 years. only 3 patients required temporary convalescent care after discharge. actuarial survival at 1,3, and 5 years was 86%, 62%, and 43%, respectively, for all discharged patients (n = 52) and 97%, 78%, and 57% for stage i cases (n = 39). patients with tumors beyond stage i fared poorly.   conclusions advanced age per se in neither a contraindication to curative resection nor a routine indication for nonanatomic operations in healthy octogenarians with stage i lung cancer. with proper selection, acute risk should be low. pneumonectomy, extended resection, and operation for stage ii or iii disease should be considered only in exceptional cases.
drug interaction between celecoxib and methotrexate in organic anion transporter 3-transfected renal cells and in rats in vivo. the plasma protein binding of celecoxib was determined for animals and humans using in vitro and ex vivo methods. eight, healthy, human volunteers (three male, five female, 20–39 years) received celecoxib (600 mg) bid for 7 days, blood samples were collected and concentrations of bound and unbound celecoxib determined. the fraction of bound drug in the volunteers was constant (97.4±0.1%) at total celecoxib plasma concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 4.02 μg/ml. the ex vivo plasma protein binding of celecoxib in the animals was concentration‐independent up to approximately 12, 8 and 10 μg/ml for mouse, rat and dog, respectively. the plasma protein binding of celecoxib after a single oral dose of 10 and 300 mg/kg to mice was 98.3±0.2%, of 1 and 400 mg/kg to rats was 98.3±0.2% and of 1 and 100 mg/kg to dogs was 98.5±0.1%. the percent binding of celecoxib to plasma proteins in vitro was slightly lower than those values determined ex vivo. the in vitro binding of celecoxib to plasma protein was constant over the concentrations of 0.1–10 μg/ml for all species, except rat. copyright © 1999 john wiley & sons, ltd.
effectiveness of learner-regulated study sequence: an in-vivo study in introductory psychology course kornell and bjork (psychological science 19:585–592, 2008) found that interleaving exemplars of different categories enhanced inductive learning of the concepts based on those exemplars. they hypothesized that the benefit of mixing exemplars from different categories is that doing so highlights differences between the categories. kang and pashler (applied cognitive psychology 26:97–103, 2012) obtained results consistent with this discriminative-contrast hypothesis: interleaving enhanced inductive learning, but temporal spacing, which does not highlight category differences, did not. we further tested the discriminative-contrast hypothesis by examining the effects of interleaving and spacing, as well as their combined effects. in three experiments, using photographs of butterflies and birds as the stimuli, temporal spacing was harmful when it interrupted the juxtaposition of interleaved categories, even when total spacing was held constant, supporting the discriminative-contrast hypothesis. temporal spacing also had value, however, when it did not interrupt discrimination processing.
the cholesterol-complexing agent digitonin modulates ligand binding of the bovine hippocampal serotonin1a receptor to investigate the effect of cholesterol on the oxytocin receptor function in myometrial membranes, we developed a new method to alter the membrane cholesterol content. using a methyl-substituted beta-cyclodextrin, we were able to selectively deplete the myometrial plasma membrane of cholesterol. vice versa, incubating cholesterol-depleted membranes with a preformed soluble cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin complex restored the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane. binding experiments showed that, with the removal of cholesterol from the membrane, the dissociation constant for [3h]oxytocin is enhanced 87-fold (from kd = 1.5 nm to kd = 131 nm), therefore shifting the oxytocin receptor from high to low affinity. increasing the cholesterol content of the cholesterol-depleted membrane again restored the high-affinity binding (kd = 1.2 nm). the presence of 0.1 mm gtp gamma s did not significantly change the number of high-affinity binding sites for [3h]oxytocin in native plasma membranes, in membranes depleted of cholesterol, and in plasma membranes with restored cholesterol content. the number of high-affinity binding sites for the oxytocin antagonist [3h]prota was dependent in the same way on the cholesterol content as for [3h]oxytocin. substitution of the membrane cholesterol with other steroids showed a strong dependence of the oxytocin receptor function on the structure of the cholesterol molecule. the detergent-solubilized oxytocin receptor was not saturable with [3h]oxytocin even at concentrations up to 10(-6) m of radioligand. addition of the cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin complex to the detergent-solubilized oxytocin receptor induced a saturation of the solubilized binding sites (bmax = 0.98 pmol/mg) for oxytocin (kd = 16 nm).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
granger causality analysis of steady-state electroencephalographic signals during propofol-induced anaesthesia study objectives the electrophysiological correlates of anesthetic sedation remain poorly understood. we used high-density electroencephalography (hd-eeg) and source modeling to investigate the cortical processes underlying propofol anesthesia and compare them to sleep.   design 256-channel eeg recordings in humans during propofol anesthesia.   setting hospital operating room.   patients or participants 8 healthy subjects (4 males).   interventions n/a.   measurements and results initially, propofol induced increases in eeg power from 12-25 hz. loss of consciousness (loc) was accompanied by the appearance of eeg slow waves that resembled the slow waves of nrem sleep. we compared slow waves in propofol to slow waves recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially propagate along the mesial components of the default network. however, propofol slow waves were spatially blurred compared to sleep slow waves and failed to effectively entrain spindle activity. propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25-40 hz) power that persisted throughout loc. source modeling analysis showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. during loc, we found increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions compared to the wakefulness.   conclusions propofol anesthesia is a sleep-like state and slow waves are associated with diminished consciousness even in the presence of high gamma activity.
comparison of local infiltration analgesia with femoral nerve block for total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized clinical trial. background we report a prospective blinded randomised trial of local infiltration versus femoral nerve block in patients undergoing primary total knee replacement (tkr), in accordance with the consort statement 2010.   methods fifty patients in a teaching hospital were consented for the study. the study arms were intraoperative local anaesthesia (150ml 0.2% ropivacaine/1ml 1:1000 adrenaline/30mg ketolorac) and femoral nerve block (30ml 0.2% ropivacaine) with a primary outcome of pain score at 4h post operatively. secondary outcomes were pain at 2h, pain scores before and after physiotherapy on day one, total opiate administered, time to physiotherapy goals and length of stay. randomisation was by sealed envelope. the assessor was blinded and the patients partially blinded to the intervention.   results ten patients were excluded, eight before randomisation. the trial is complete. forty patients were analysed for the primary outcome measure. the local infiltration group had significantly lower pain scores at 4h post-operatively; mean [sd] score 2.1 [2.6] versus 6.8 [3.2], p<0.00001 and on post-operative day one prior to physiotherapy; mean score 2.4 [2.3] versus 4.4 [2.3], p<0.05. total opiate use was also significantly lower in the local infiltration group; mean total 115 [50.3]mg versus 176.5 [103.5]mg, p<0.01. there was no difference in any other outcome. there were no harms as a result of either intervention.   conclusion intraoperative local infiltration gives superior pain relief compared to single shot femoral nerve block over the first 24h following primary tkr and minimises post-operative opiate use.
changes in pulmonary function and influencing factors after high-dose intrathoracic radio(chemo)therapy purpose to evaluate the long-term impact of locoregional breast radiotherapy (rt) on pulmonary function tests (pfts).   methods and materials this study included 75 women who underwent postoperative locoregional breast rt. pfts were performed before rt and 3, 6, and 12 months and 8 to 10 years after rt. by use of univariate and multivariate analyses, the impact of treatment- and patient-related factors on late changes in pfts was evaluated.   results during the first year after rt, all pfts significantly worsened at 3 to 6 months after rt (p < 0.05). at 12 months, forced vital capacity (fvc), vital capacity (vc), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev(1)) recovered almost to baseline values, whereas total lung capacity (tlc) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (dl(co)) recovered only slightly and were still found to be decreased compared with baseline (p < 0.05). at 8 to 10 years after rt, mean reductions in fev(1) of 4% (p = 0.03) and in vc, dl(co), and tlc of 5%, 9%, and 11% (all p < 0.0001), respectively, were observed compared with pre-rt values. on multivariate analysis, tamoxifen use negatively affected tlc at 8 to 10 years after rt (p = 0.033), whereas right-sided irradiation was associated with a late reduction in fev(1) (p = 0.027). for fev(1) and dl(co), an early decrease was predictive for a late decrease (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0009, respectively).   conclusions the time course of pft changes after locoregional rt for breast cancer follows a biphasic pattern. an early reduction in pfts at 3 to 6 months with a partial recovery at 12 months after rt is followed by a late, more important pft reduction up to 8 to 10 years after rt. tamoxifen use may have an impact on this late decline in pfts.
production and characterization of rhamnolipid biosurfactant from waste frying coconut oil using a novel pseudomonas aeruginosa d the fermentative production of rhamnolipid biosurfactant from pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 2297 was carried out by submerged fermentation using various cost-effective waste materials such as orange peelings, carrot peel waste, lime peelings, coconut oil cake, and banana waste. the orange peel was found to be the best substrate generating 9.18 g/l of rhamnolipid biosurfactant with a surface tension reduction up to 31.3 mn/m. the production was growth independent, and optimum conditions were standardized. the emulsifying activity was highest against kerosene (73.3%). rhamnolipid components were purified and separated by ethyl acetate extraction, preparative silica gel column chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. the major rhamnolipid components were characterized, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, as a mixture of dirhamnolipids and monorhamnolipids.
molecular and reverse genetic characterization of nucleosome assembly protein1 (nap1) genes unravels their function in transcription and nucleotide excision repair in arabidopsis thaliana. the shoot apical meristem (sam) of seed plants is the site at which lateral organs are formed. once organ primordia initiate from the sam, they establish polarity along the adaxial-abaxial, proximodistal and mediolateral axes. among these three axes, the adaxial-abaxial polarity is of primary importance in leaf patterning. in leaf development, once the adaxial-abaxial axis is established within leaf primordia, it provides cues for proper lamina growth and asymmetric development. it was reported previously that the arabidopsis asymmetric leaves1 (as1) and asymmetric leaves2 (as2) genes are two key regulators of leaf polarity. in this work, we demonstrate a new function of the as1 and as2 genes in the establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity by analyzing as1 and as2 alleles in the landsberg erecta (ler) genetic background. we provide genetic evidence that the arabidopsis erecta (er) gene is involved in the as1-as2 pathway to promote leaf adaxial fate. in addition, we show that as1 and as2 bind to each other, suggesting that as1 and as2 may form a complex that regulates the establishment of leaf polarity. we also report the effects on leaf polarity of overexpression of the as1 or as2 genes under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) 35s promoter. although plants with as1 and as2 mutations have very similar phenotypes, 35s::as1/ler and 35s::as2/ler transgenic plants showed dramatically different morphologies. a possible model of the as1, as2 and er action in leaf polarity formation is discussed.
different subtypes of striatal neurons are selectively modulated by cortical oscillations discharge activities and local field potentials were recorded in the orofacial motor cortex and in the corresponding rostrolateral striatum of urethane-anesthetized rats. striatal projection neurons were identified by antidromic activation and fast-spiking gabaergic interneurons (fsis) by their unique characteristics: briefer spike and burst responses. juxtacellular injection of neurobiotin combined with parvalbumin immunohistochemistry validated this identification. spontaneous activities and spike responses to cortical stimulation were recorded during both states of cortical activity: slow waves and desynchronization. both fsi and projection neurons spontaneously discharged synchronously with slow waves at the maximum of cortical activity, but, on average, fsis were much more active. cortical desynchronization enhanced fsi activity and facilitated their spike responses to cortical stimulation, whereas opposite effects were observed regarding projection neurons. experimental conditions favoring fsi discharge were always associated with a decrease in the firing activity of projection neurons. spike responses to cortical stimulation occurred earlier (latency difference, 4.6 ms) and with a lower stimulation current for fsis than for projection neurons. moreover, blocking gabaa receptors by local picrotoxin injection enhanced the spike response of projection neurons, and this increase was larger in experimental conditions favoring fsi responses. therefore, on average, fsis exert in vivo a powerful feedforward inhibition on projection neurons. however, a few projection neurons were actually more sensitive to cortical stimulation than fsis. moreover, picrotoxin, which revealed fsi inhibition, preferentially affected projection neurons exhibiting the weakest sensitivity to cortical stimulation. thus, feedforward inhibition by fsis filters cortical information effectively transmitted by striatal projection neurons.
ozone co-exposure modifies cardiac responses to fine and ultrafine ambient particulate matter in mice: concordance of electrocardiogram and mechanical responses background human controlled-exposure studies have assessed the impact of ambient fine particulate matter on cardiac autonomic function measured by heart rate variability (hrv), but whether these effects are modified by concomitant ozone exposure remains unknown. objective in this study we assessed the impact of o3 and particulate matter exposure on hrv in humans. methods in a crossover design, 50 subjects (19–48 years of age) were randomized to 2-hr controlled exposures to filtered air (fa), concentrated ambient particles (caps), o3, or combined caps and ozone (caps + o3). the primary end point was change in hrv between the start and end of exposure. secondary analyses included blood pressure (bp) responses, and effect modification by asthmatic status. results achieved mean caps and o3 exposure concentrations were 121.6 ± 48.0 μg/m3 and 113.9 ± 6.6 ppb, respectively. in a categorical analysis, exposure had no consistent effect on hrv indices. however, the dose–response relationship between caps mass concentration and hrv indices seemed to vary depending on the presence of o3. this heterogeneity was statistically significant for the low-frequency component of hrv (p = 0.02) and approached significance for the high-frequency component and time-domain measures of hrv. exposure to caps + o3 increased diastolic bp by 2.0 mmhg (se, 1.2; p = 0.02). no other statistically significant changes in bp were observed. asthmatic status did not modify these effects. conclusion the potentiation by o3 of caps effects on diastolic bp and possibly hrv is of small magnitude in young adults. further studies are needed to assess potential effects in more vulnerable populations.
regulation of insulin gene expression by cytokines and cell–cell interactions in mouse medullary thymic epithelial cells cd7 and cd28 are ig superfamily molecules expressed on thymocytes and mature t cells that share common signaling 0mechanisms and are co-mitogens for t cell activation. cd7-deficient mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced shock syndrome, and have diminished in vivo lps-triggered ifn-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha production. cd28-deficient mice have decreased serum ig levels, defective igg isotype switching, decreased t cell il-2 production and are resistant to staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin-induced shock. to determine synergistic roles cd7 and cd28 might play in thymocyte development and function, we have generated and characterized cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice. cd7/cd28-deficient mice were healthy, reproduced normally, had normal numbers of thymocyte subsets and had normal thymus histology. anti-cd3 mab induced similar levels of apoptosis in cd7-deficient, cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28 double-deficient thymocytes as in control c57bl/6 mice (p = ns). similarly, thymocyte viability, apoptosis and necrosis following ionomycin or dexamethasone treatment were the same in control, cd7-deficient, cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28-deficient mice. cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28-deficient thymocytes had decreased [3h]thymidine incorporation responses to concanavalin a (con a) stimulation compared to control mice (p < or = 0.01 and p < or = 0.05 respectively). cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice had significantly reduced numbers of b7-1/b7-2 double-positive cells compared to freshly isolated wild-type, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient thymocytes. con a-stimulated cd4/cd8 double-negative (dn) thymocytes from cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice expressed significantly lower levels of cd25 when compared to cd4/cd8 dn thymocytes from wild-type, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient mice (p < 0.05). anti-cd3-triggered cd7/cd28-deficient thymocytes also had decreased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production compared to c57bl/6 control, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient mice (p < or = 0.05). thus, cd7 and cd28 deficiencies combined to produce abnormalities in the absolute number of b7-1/b7-2-expressing cells in the thymus, thymocyte il-2 receptor expression and cd3-triggered cytokine production.
medial prefrontal default-mode hypoactivity affecting trait physical anhedonia in schizophrenia background there have been reports that patients with schizophrenia have decreased metabolic activity in prefrontal cortex. however, findings have been confounded by medication effects, chronic illness, and difficulties of measurement. we aimed to address these problems by examination of cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography (pet).   methods we studied 17 neuroleptic-naïve patients at the early stages of illness by means of image analysis and statistical methods that can detect abnormalities at the gyral level.   findings an initial omnibus test with a randomisation analysis indicated that patients differed from normal controls at the 0.06 level. in the follow-up analysis, three separate prefrontal regions had decreased perfusion (lateral, orbital, medial), as well as regions in inferior temporal and parietal cortex that are known to be anatomically connected. regions with increased perfusion were also identified (eg, thalamus, cerebellum, retrosplenial cingulate), which suggests an imbalance in distributed cortical and subcortical circuits.   interpretation these distributed dysfunctional circuits may form the neural basis of schizophrenia through cognitive impairment of the brain, which prevents it from processing input efficiently and producing output effectively, thereby leading to symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and loss of volition.
comparative evaluation of six commercialized multiplex pcr kits for the diagnosis of respiratory infections abstract    this study compares the performance of four commercial multiplex pcr assays (resplex ii panel v2.0, seeplex rv15, xtag rvp and xtag rvp fast) and direct fluorescent antibody (dfa) staining and viral isolation. seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 17 viral agents. in each assay, the sensitivity and specificity for each target were determined against a composite reference standard. two hundred and eighty-eight out of 750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by dfa or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex pcr, for a total positivity rate of 66.9%. of 502 positive specimens, one virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two in 77 (15.3%), three in four (0.8%) and four in one case (0.2%). compared with a composite reference standard, the inter-assay accuracy of the multiplex pcr assays varied, but all were superior to conventional diagnostic methods in detecting a broad range of respiratory viral agents in children. in addition, the sensitivity of two commercial assays, resplex ii plus pre and seeplex influenza a/b subtyping, was determined relative to the astra influenza screen & type assay for detection of influenza a viruses, including seasonal influenzas and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a virus. using 75 positive and 55 negative nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza a by the astra assay, the sensitivity of seeplex and resplex was 95.9% and 91.8%, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for both.
health-related quality of life, psychosocial strains, and coping in parents of children with chronic renal failure families with a child on chronic peritoneal dialysis have to assume a significant burden of care, intensifying the demands and the reorganization of roles in the families of children. the purpose of this study is to describe the implications of role changes in families of children with chronic renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. this is a case study of four families of children with chronic renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. fourteen family members participate in the study. after the child's chronic kidney failure and the start of treatment, each relative's ways, acts and functions are changed, maintained or adapted to the new family dynamics, imposed by the child's treatment conditions. appropriate role assessment provides the nurse and the families of children with chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis with insight regarding current and potential health problems and aids in identifying the needs of the families.
skeletal alterations associated with the use of bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. objective to evaluate the long-term effects of rapid maxillary expansion (rme) via banded expanders in the sagittal and vertical facial planes.   materials and methods the sample consisted of 25 patients who had undergone rme (with either haas-type or hyrax hygienic expanders) followed by standard edgewise orthodontic therapy. this sample was compared with a group of 25 patients who had edgewise treatment only and with a control nontreatment group of 26 subjects, matched by age and gender with the patients of the other two groups. lateral cephalograms were taken before treatment (t1), at the end of treatment (t2), and at 3 years posttreatment (t3), comprising a 5-year average time of observation.   results rme treatment, in the long-term, did not influence the sagittal position of the apical jaw bases or the facial vertical dimension.   conclusion unfavorable cephalometric changes resulting immediately after rme are temporary, and therefore concerns about using rme in patients with vertical growth patterns or an extremely convex facial profile are not substantiated.
chronic psychosocial stress: does it modulate immunity to the influenza vaccine in hong kong chinese elderly caregivers? to determine whether a chronic stressor (caregiving for a spouse with a progressive dementia) is associated with an impaired immune response to influenza virus vaccination, we compared 32 caregivers' vaccine responses with those of 32 sex-, age-, and socioeconomically matched control subjects. caregivers showed a poorer antibody response following vaccination relative to control subjects as assessed by two independent methods, elisa and hemagglutination inhibition. caregivers also had lower levels of in vitro virus-specific-induced interleukin 2 levels and interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6 did not differ between groups. these data demonstrate that down-regulation of the immune response to influenza virus vaccination is associated with a chronic stressor in the elderly. these results could have implications for vulnerability to infection among older adults.
effect of fluid intake on renal function during exercise in the cold plasma volume (pv), protein, and electrolyte shifts were measured in two groups of five men in the supine position during rest, exercise (40-47% vo2max), and recovery in cool (ta = 26.5 degrees c) and hot (ta = 39.4 degrees c) environments. they drank 16-17 ml/kg hypertonic (1.5%) nacl, isotonic (0.9%) nacl, or hypertonic (1.5%) calcium gluconate solutions during the preexercise rest period. hyper-na consumption retarded the rise in pv (hypervolemia) at rest in the cool but not in the heat. ingestion of iso-na and hyper-na resulted in twofold greater hypervolemia at rest in the heat. during exercise and recovery, pv was highest with hyper-na in the heat. hyper-ca prevented the normal hypervolemic response at rest in both environments. the normal hypervolemic responses during exercise were not influenced by any drink composition. the results suggest hypertonic drinks may be better for maintaining pv levels during exercise in heat; but calcium must be used with care.
general practitioners' coronary risk estimates, decisions to start lipid-lowering treatment, gender and length of clinical experience: their interactions in primary prevention. the tenets of fuzzy trace theory are summarized with respect to their relevance to health and medical decision making. illustrations are given for hiv prevention, cardiovascular disease, surgical risk, genetic risk, and cancer prevention and control. a core idea of fuzzy trace theory is that people rely on the gist of information, its bottom-line meaning, as opposed to verbatim details in judgment and decision making. this idea explains why precise information (e.g., about risk) is not necessarily effective in encouraging prevention behaviors or in supporting medical decision making. people can get the facts right, and still not derive the proper meaning, which is key to informed decision making. getting the gist is not sufficient, however. retrieval (e.g., of health-related values) and processing interference brought on by thinking about nested or overlapping classes (e.g., in ratio concepts, such as probability) are also important. theory-based interventions that work (and why they work) are presented, ranging from specific techniques aimed at enhancing representation, retrieval, and processing to a comprehensive intervention that integrates these components.
a serological and molecular survey of hepatitis b in children 15 years after inception of the national hepatitis b vaccination program in eastern china the long-term efficacy of hepatitis b vaccination among high-risk infants was determined in 805 vaccine responders, immunized at birth in taiwan during 1981-1984 and followed to age 10 years, via life table survival and cox multivariate analyses. at 10 years, cumulative persistence of antibody to hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs) was 85%, and cumulative incidence of hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection was 15%. three children became carriers. twelve-month anti-hbs titer was the strongest predictor of efficacy. the higher the initial titer, the lower the risk of anti-hbs loss (relative risk [rr], 0.26 for titer of 100-999 miu/ml; rr, 0.08 for titer >1000 miu/ml; p<.001) and hbv infection (rr, 0.55 and 0.27; p<.05). maternal hepatitis b e antigen positivity but not hepatitis b immunoglobulin dose or gender predicted greater antibody persistence to age 10 years. because the level of antibody persistence remained high and few became carriers, booster revaccination within 10 years seems unnecessary.
protein markers and seed size variation in common bean segregating populations neutral detergent fiber (ndf) is considered the laboratory measure most closely correlated with voluntary intake of forages by ruminant livestock. the objectives of this study were to create smooth bromegrass (bromus inermis leyss.) populations divergent for ndf concentration in four smooth bromegrass germplasm pools and to identify random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) marker changes in these divergently selected populations. two cycles of divergent phenotypic selection led to significant linear responses in ndf among selection cycles for all germplasm pools. within-population variation for rapd markers was large, reflecting the outcrossing reproduction and the complex inheritance of smooth bromegrass. however, analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic differences among selected populations. analysis of genetic distances showed that each cycle of selection created additional divergence, both among cycles and among germplasm pools. up to 15 rapd markers were associated with selection in each population, but only one marker was consistently associated with selection for ndf across all four germplasm pools (linear, homogeneous slopes, no drift). some of the rapd markers appear to have utility for marker selection or marker-assisted selection (mas) to modify ndf concentration.
age-related changes of serum mitochondrial uncoupling 1, rumen and rectal temperature in goats. the uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) is an indicator of brown adipocytes and is involved in the control of body temperature and regulation of energy balance. it abundantly expresses in newborns and has important functions in adults. however, little information was known on ucp1 gene expression in young and adolescent sheep. in this study, we cloned and identified the full-length dna and cdna sequences of the ovine ucp1 gene, which were 6659 bp and 1621 bp, respectively, and predicted the location of the gene on chromosome 17. forty-eight animals with an equal number of males and females each for both guangling large tail sheep (glt) and small tail sheep han (sth) sheep were used to study the ontogenetic expression of ucp1 mrna in eight adipose tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the results showed that the mrna was expressed in all tissues studied and at all stages from 2 to 12 months of age. nevertheless, the mrna in perirenal fat was expressed significantly higher than that in other tissues and lower in superficial fat than in deep deposits. the highest expression was observed in animals at 2 months of age and then decreased gradually with age. global expression in glt was significantly higher than that in sth. interactions between tissue and breed and age also influenced the mrna expression significantly. in addition, the mrna expression was associated with the single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) haplotypes detected in the cdna of the gene.
unfavorable anatomical factors influencing the success of retrograde intrarenal surgery for lower pole renal calculi. purpose percutaneous nephrolithotomy has been the standard of care for intrarenal calculi greater than 2 cm. flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy is a minimally invasive treatment modality that is able to treat large intrarenal calculi with the potential to decrease morbidity, while maintaining a high level of efficacy.   materials and methods a total of 15 patients with a single intrarenal calculus 2 cm or greater were treated with retrograde ureteroscopic nephrolithotripsy. lithotripsy was performed with a 7.2fr flexible ureteroscope and 200 micron laser fiber. the stone-free rate was defined as the absence of any stones in the kidney or residual stone fragments less than 1 mm, which is too small to be extracted with a basket or a grasper. all patients underwent followup ureteroscopy within 15 days after the last procedure and renal ultrasound 30 days after the last treatment.   results there were a total of 15 intrarenal calculi 20 to 25 mm (mean 22) in diameter. the mean number of procedures was 2.3 (range 2 to 4). the overall stone-free rate was 93.3%. one patient (6.6%) had a residual 5 mm stone fragment in the lower pole of the kidney, which was followed expectantly for 2 years with no change in size. there were no major complications. there were 3 minor complications (20%), including 1 emergency room visit for fever and pain, and 2 cases of gross hematuria. all cases were performed on an outpatient basis.   conclusions in select patients with a single intrarenal calculus 2 cm or greater small diameter flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy may represent an alternative therapy to standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy with acceptable efficacy and low morbidity.
autonomic control after blockade of the norepinephrine transporter: a model of orthostatic intolerance. 1. the fluctuations that underlie the spontaneous variability of blood pressure (bp) and heart rate (hr) were investigated in conscious normotensive rats using power spectral analysis.
cost-effectiveness analysis of the available pneumococcal conjugated vaccines for children under five years in colombia background heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-7) was licensed to provide immunity against pneumococcal disease caused by seven serotypes of s. pneumoniae. thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-13) includes 6 additional serotypes for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease.   objective the objective of this study was to estimate the potential health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with pcv-13 in the community of valencia and to generate valuable information for policy makers at regional and country levels.   methods a decision tree was designed to determine the health and economic outcomes in hypothetical cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated children followed over their lifetime. information about disease incidence and serotype distribution were gathered from local databases and from published and unpublished local records. pcv-13 effectiveness was extrapolated from pcv-7 efficacy data. a 5% of herd effect and a serotype replacement of 25% were considered for the base case scenario. only direct costs were taken into account and results were expressed in terms of life-years gained (lyg) and quality adjusted life years (qaly).   results implementing a universal pcv-13 vaccination program in the community of valencia would decrease the number of hospital admitted pneumonia to less than 4571 cases while avoiding 310 cases of ipd and 82,596 cases of aom throughout the cohort lifetime. a total of 190 s. pneumoniae related deaths would be averted over the same period. total medical costs of non-vaccinating the cohort of newborns would reach up to 403,850.859€ compared to 438,762.712€ that would represent vaccinating the cohort. the incremental cost of vaccinating the children was estimated in 12,794€/lyg and 10,407€/qaly, respectively.   conclusions a universal pcv-13 vaccination program in the community of valencia would be a cost-effective intervention from the payer perspective after preventing for pneumococcal infections and for decreasing its associated mortality and morbidity.
birbeck granule-like “organized smooth endoplasmic reticulum” resulting from the expression of a cytoplasmic yfp-tagged langerin a heterozygous mutation in the langerin gene corresponding to position 837 in the langerin mrna was identified in a person deficient in birbeck granules (bg). this mutation results in an amino acid replacement of tryptophan by arginine at position 264 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of the langerine protein. expression of mutated langerin in human fibroblasts induces tubular-like structures that are negative for bg-specific antibodies and do not resemble the characteristic structural features of bg.
cannabinoids inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway in gliomas vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a key regulator of physiological angiogenesis during embryogenesis, skeletal growth and reproductive functions. vegf has also been implicated in pathological angiogenesis associated with tumors, intraocular neovascular disorders and other conditions. the biological effects of vegf are mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks), vegfr-1 and vegfr-2, which differ considerably in signaling properties. non-signaling co-receptors also modulate vegf rtk signaling. currently, several vegf inhibitors are undergoing clinical testing in several malignancies. vegf inhibition is also being tested as a strategy for the prevention of angiogenesis, vascular leakage and visual loss in age-related macular degeneration.
constrained action selection in children with developmental coordination disorder. response times generally increase linearly with the logarithm of the number of potential stimulus–response alternatives (e.g., hick’s law). the ubiquity and theoretical importance of this generalization make exceptions particularly interesting. recently, kveraga et al. (exp brain res 146:307, 2002) added a third to the two previously known exceptions, demonstrating that saccade latencies were unaffected by stimulus–response uncertainty. they suggest that visually guided saccades are exceptional, because these movements can be automatically selected using a privileged pathway: the topographically organized regions in superior colliculus that convert spatially coded visual activity into spatially coded motor commands. we report that visually guided, aimed hand movements also are unaffected by both stimulus–response uncertainty and stimulus–response repetition. a second experiment demonstrated that this lack of an uncertainty effect persists for equiluminant stimuli. this result suggests that posterior parietal cortex is not the privileged pathway eliminating stimulus–response uncertainty for hand movements. because hand movements are not guided by mechanisms in the superior colliculus, our results cast doubt on the privileged-pathway hypothesis, at least for hand movements. instead, the absence of stimulus–response uncertainty may occur only in tasks that do not require the stimulus to be associated with a response effector and that have high stimulus–response compatibility.
differential effects of ozone on photosynthesis of winter wheat among cultivars depend on antioxidative enzymes rather than stomatal conductance. we present a comment about "ozone risk assessment for plants: central role of metabolism-dependent changes in reducing power" by dizengremel, le thiec, bagard, and jolivet. as tools for summarizing plant o(3) sensitivity in simple indices, dizengremel et al. suggest: reducing power, as antioxidant regeneration through the halliwell/asada cycle requires nadph from the photosynthetic light reaction; rubisco/pepc ratio, as an index of the energy balance between anabolic and catabolic reactions; and water-use efficiency as a time-integrated approximation of the carbon gain to stomatal o(3) uptake ratio. the scientific background is solid, and simple enough (although expensive) to be translated into modelling and routine use. in the last decade, several approaches have been developed, mostly by using photosynthesis as a metric of defence. all these approaches should be experimentally tested in different and realistic conditions, before the results are transferred to the field and used in effective o(3) flux modelling and assessment.
predicting changes in perception of itching in chronic skin diseases by personality characteristics, anxiety, and depression pruritus and psyche are intricately and reciprocally related, with psychophysiological evidence and psychopathological explanations helping us to understand their complex association. their interaction may be conceptualized and classified into 3 groups: pruritic diseases with psychiatric sequelae, pruritic diseases aggravated by psychosocial factors, and psychiatric disorders causing pruritus. management of chronic pruritus is directed at treating the underlying causes and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to address the dermatologic, somatosensory, cognitive, and emotional aspects. pharmcotherapeutic agents that are useful for chronic pruritus with comorbid depression and/or anxiety comprise selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and doxepin), and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin); the role of neurokinin receptor-1 antagonists awaits verification. antipsychotics are required for treating itch and formication associated with schizophrenia and delusion of parasitosis (including morgellons disease).
behavioural addictions in adolescents and young adults: results from a prevalence study abstract objective taking into account the importance of act prevention on the development of addictions, we assessed the presence of multiple addictions in an adolescent high-school population, also assessing the prevalence of internet abuse and the impact on disability. introduction adolescence seems to be a critical period of addiction vulnerability, based on social but also neurobiological factors.the earlier onset of behavioral/substance dependence seems to predict greater addiction severity, morbidity, and multiple addictive disorders. methods data were collected from a sample of 275 students in florence, italy, high schools through surveys distributed in classes. the sample had an average age of 16.67±1.85 years (52.4% males, 47.6% females). to assess multiple addiction we used the 16 subscales of the shorter promis questionnaire, to assess internet addiction prevalence we used the internet addiction scale, and to quantify disability symptoms, we used the sheehan disability scale. results caffeine abuse, sex, relationship submissive, gambling, food starving, and food bingeing have raised highest scores. 5.4% of the students were found to be internet addicted similar to other countries. disability seemed strongly correlated to the subscale of alcohol, gambling, sex, tobacco, food starving and food bingeing, shopping, exercise, and internet addiction. gambling, sex, caffeine abuse, compulsive help dominant, work, internet addiction, relationship dominant, and relationship submissive in this sample were strongly related to substance dependence. conclusion level of concerns unexpected compared to the level reported in other countries for the behavioral compulsions, have been highlighted. behavioral addictions are multiple, a source of disability, and they are related to substance abuse. it has yet to be clarified if they are a temporary phenomenon occurring in adolescents or if they are a stable trait, accounting as marker for the development of substance abuse.
prevalence and predictors of complementary and alternative medicine use among people with coronary heart disease or at risk for this in the sixth tromsø study: a comparative analysis using protection motivation theory objective the focus of this study was to examine the patterns of provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (cam) use across three chronic illness groups, and to identify the socio-demographic, health-related, and psychosocial factors associated with cam use.   design cross-sectional international survey administered on the internet to individuals with arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and mixed chronic conditions.   main outcome measures self-reported consultations to cam providers and to a variety of conventional health-care services made in the previous 6 months.   results 365 surveys were received from people with arthritis (n=140), ibd (n=110), and other chronic conditions (n=115). overall 38.1% of respondents had used cam, with rates ranging from 31.8 to 46.1% across the three illness groups. backward step-wise logistic regression revealed that being female, having more than high school education, a greater number of comorbid conditions, higher perceived control over health and reward motivations, lower stress and less belief that health is governed by chance, were the best predictors of cam consultations. cam clients also used a greater variety of conventional health-care services and made more consultations relative to non-cam clients.   conclusions in this study the socio-demographic and health status factors associated with cam consultations in three different chronic illness groups were similar to those found in the general population. cam use in the study population was also related to higher use and a greater variety of use of conventional health-care services, and with stronger beliefs in the controllability of health and an enduring motivation to seek out rewards.
potassium channels modulate the action but not the synthesis of hydrogen sulfide in rat corpus cavernosum the relaxant effect of hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) in the vascular tree is well established but its influence and mechanism of action in gastrointestinal smooth muscle was hardly investigated. the influence of h(2)s on contractility in mouse gastric fundus was therefore examined. sodium hydrogen sulfide (nahs; h(2)s donor) was administered to prostaglandin f(2alpha) (pgf(2alpha))-contracted circular muscle strips of mouse gastric fundus, before and after incubation with interfering drugs. nahs caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the pre-contracted mouse gastric fundus strips. the k(+) channels blockers glibenclamide, apamin, charybdotoxin, 4-aminopyridin and barium chloride had no influence on the nahs-induced relaxation. the relaxation by nahs was also not influenced by l-name, odq and sq 22536, inhibitors of the cgmp and camp pathway, by nerve blockers capsazepine, omega-conotoxin and tetrodotoxin or by several channel and receptor blockers (ouabain, nifedipine, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate, ryanodine and thapsigargin). the myosin light chain phosphatase (mlcp) inhibitor calyculin-a reduced the nahs-induced relaxation, but the rho-kinase inhibitor y-27632 had no influence. we show that nahs is able to relax pgf(2alpha)-contracted mouse gastric fundus strips. the results suggest that in the mouse gastric fundus, h(2)s causes relaxation at least partially via activation of mlcp.
high dispersal ability and low genetic differentiation in the widespread butterfly species melanargia galathea many studies aim at testing the impact of recent fragmentation on the genetic diversity and connectivity of populations, while some species do exist naturally in fragmented landscapes because of their habitat requirements. therefore, it is important to look at the genetic signatures of species occurring in naturally fragmented landscapes in order to disentangle the effect of fragmentation from the effect of habitat requirements. we selected two nymphalid butterflies for this purpose. while melanargia galathea is a common butterfly in flower-rich meadows, melitaea aurelia is closely connected to calcareous grasslands, thus being historically fragmented due to its ecological demands. for the analysis of the genetic response on these opposed patterns, we analysed 18 allozyme loci for 789 individuals (399 individuals of m. galathea and 390 individuals of m. aurelia) in a western german study region with adjacent areas in luxemburg and northeastern france. both species showed similarly low genetic differentiations among local populations (m. galathea: fst 3.3%; m. aurelia: fst 3.6%), both combined with a moderate level of inbreeding. isolation-by-distance analysis revealed a significant correlation for both species with similar amounts of explained variances (m. galathea: r2 = 27.8%; m. aurelia: r2 = 28.5%). most parameters of genetic diversity were higher in m. galathea than in m. aurelia, but the latter species had a considerably higher amount of rare or locally restricted genes; the differing ecological demands are thus reflected in these differences. both species thus seem to be genetically well suited to their respective ecological requirements. in the light of conservation genetics, we deduce that highly fragmented populations are not necessarily prone to extinction. the extinction risk might be linked to the life history of an organism and its population genetic structure.
burnout syndrome and associated factors among medical students: a cross-sectional study purpose burnout, a marker of professional distress prevalent among residents and physicians, has been speculated to originate in medical school. little is known about burnout in medical students. the authors sought to identify the prevalence of burnout, variation of its prevalence during medical school, and the impact of personal life events on burnout and other types of student distress. method all medical students (n = 1,098) attending the three medical schools in minnesota were surveyed in spring 2004 using validated instruments to assess burnout, quality of life, depression, and alcohol use. students were also asked about the prevalence of positive and negative personal life events in the previous 12 months. results a total of 545 medical students (response rate 50%) completed the survey. burnout was present in 239 (45%) of medical students. while the frequency of a positive depression screen and at-risk alcohol use decreased among more senior students, the frequency of burnout increased (all p < .03). the number of negative personal life events in the last 12 months also correlated with the risk of burnout (p = .0160). personal life events demonstrated a stronger relationship to burnout than did year in training on multivariate analysis. conclusions burnout appears common among u.s. medical students and may increase by year of schooling. despite the notion that burnout is primarily linked to work-related stress, personal life events also demonstrated a strong relationship to professional burnout. the authors' findings suggest both personal and curricular factors are related to burnout among medical students. efforts to decrease burnout must address both of these elements.

posttraumatic stress reactions in parents of children esophageal atresia aim: to study the prevalence of posttraumatic stress in parents after an acute admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (picu) and to determine risk factors for the development of posttraumatic stress.
three-dimensional solution structure and backbone dynamics of a variant of human interleukin-3. human interleukin 4 (il-4) has been studied by 2d and 3d nmr techniques using uniformly 15n-labeled recombinant protein. assignment of resonances for all but 3 of the 130 residues of the recombinant protein has been achieved, enabling the secondary structure of the protein to be defined. this consists of four major alpha-helical regions and one short section of double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. analysis of distance and angle restraints derived from nmr experiments has enabled the overall molecular topology to be determined. this is related to that found for other four-helix proteins but has several distinctive features including cross-linking of helices by means of three disulfide bonds and a short section of beta-sheet. the structural analysis gives support to the hypothesis that many helical cytokines have a common fold and provides a basis for understanding the biological function of il-4.
atp-binding cassette superfamily transporter gene expression in human primary ovarian carcinoma. expression of the human mdr1 gene has been shown to confer the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype to sensitive cells. to investigate the possible contribution of the mdr phenotype to chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma, we have analyzed mdr1 gene expression in fresh carcinoma specimens from 50 patients. fifteen received chemotherapy before surgery and were judged as poor responders. thirty-five patients did not receive any drug before surgery. control tissues were lymphocytes from 7 patients. total rnas were analyzed by northern and slot blot hybridization techniques using human mdr1 complementary dna and human gamma-actin complementary dna probes sequentially as qualitative and quantitative controls. mdr1 transcripts (4.5 kilobases) were observed in the rna preparations obtained from 3 of 10 patients who were treated with doxorubicin or vincristine, 2 drugs known to select the mdr phenotype in vitro. in 40 other rna preparations obtained from 35 untreated patients and 5 patients treated exclusively with cyclophosphamide and cis-platinum, no transcript could be detected. using the exact fisher test, the difference between the 2 groups was found to be significant (p less than 0.01). the three tumors with elevated mdr1 expression did not show mdr1 dna amplification. our study suggests that, in spite of the weak occurrence of the mdr process in patients with ovarian cancers, mdr1 expression can be related to previous treatment with doxorubicin or vincristine. these results favor the expression of the mdr1 gene as one of the determinants involved in the acquired chemoresistance of ovarian cancers.
effect of conceptus on transforming growth factor (tgf) β1 mrna expression and protein concentration in the porcine endometrium—in vivo and in vitro studies we examined the localization of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta in first-trimester and term human decidua and chorionic villi and explored the role of this factor on the proliferation and differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells. two antibodies, 1d11.16.8, a mouse monoclonal neutralizing antibody capable of recognizing both tgf-beta 1 and tgf-beta 2 and cl-b1/29, a rabbit polyclonal antibody capable of recognizing tgf-beta 2, were used to immunolocalize tgf-beta in fixed, paraffin-embedded, or fixed, frozen sections of placenta and decidua, providing similar results. intense labeling was observed in the extracellular matrix (ecm) of the first-trimester decidua and cytoplasm of term decidual cells. syncytiotrophoblast cell cytoplasm as well as the ecm in the core of the chorionic villi of both first-trimester and term placentas exhibited a moderate degree of labeling. strong cytoplasmic labeling was observed in the cytotrophoblastic shell of the term placenta. to examine the role of tgf-beta on trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, early passage cultures of first-trimester and primary cultures of term trophoblast cells were established and characterized on the basis of numerous immunocytochemical and functional markers. these cells expressed cytokeratin, placental alkaline phosphatase, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and pregnancy-specific beta glycoprotein, but not factor viii or 63d3; they also produced hcg and collagenase type iv. exposure of first-trimester trophoblast cultures to tgf-beta 1 significantly inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. an antiproliferative effect was also noted in the presence of tgf-beta 2. these effects were abrogated in the presence of the neutralizing anti-tgf-beta antibody (1d11.16.8) in a concentration-dependent manner. in a 3-day culture, exogenous tgf-beta 1 stimulated formation of multinucleated cells by the first trimester as well as term trophoblast cells. addition of neutralizing anti-tgf-beta antibody to first-trimester trophoblast cells stimulated proliferation beyond control levels in a 24-h culture and reduced formation of multinucleated cells in a 3-day culture, indicating the presence of endogenous tgf-beta activity. these results indicate that tgf-beta produced at the human fetal-maternal interface plays a major regulatory role in the proliferation and differentiation of the trophoblast.
polyneuropathy and myopathy in beta-thalassemia major patients thalassemia is a common genetic disorder in tunisia. early iron concentration assessment is a crucial and challenging issue. most of annual deaths due to iron overload occurred in underdeveloped regions of the world. limited access to liver and heart mri monitoring might partially explain these poor prognostic results. standard software programs are not available in tunisia. this study is the first to evaluate iron overload in heart and liver using the mri t2* with excel spreadsheet for post processing. association of this mri tool results to serum ferritin level, and echocardiography was also investigated. one hundred tunisian-transfused thalassemia patients older than 10 years (16.1 ± 5.2) were enrolled in the study. the mean myocardial iron concentration (mic) was 1.26 ± 1.65 mg/g dw (0.06–8.32). cardiac t2* (ct2*) was under 20 ms in 30 % of patients and under 10 ms in 21 % of patients. left ventricular ejection function was significantly lower in patients with ct2* <10 ms. abnormal liver iron concentration (lic >3 mg/g dw) was found in 95 % of patients. lic was over 15 mg/g dw in 25 % of patients. mic was more correlated than ct2* to lic and serum ferritin. among patients with sf <1000 μg/l, 13 % had ct2* <20 ms. our data showed that 30 % of the tunisian thalassemia major patients enrolled in this cohort had myocardial iron overload despite being treated by iron chelators. sf could not reliably predict iron overload in all thalassemia patients. mri t2* using excel spreadsheet for routine follow-up of iron overload might improve the prognosis of thalassemia major patients in developing countries, such as tunisia, where standard mri tools are not available or expensive.
measuring mindfulness: a rasch analysis of the freiburg mindfulness inventory mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. this research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. the development and psychometric properties of the dispositional mindful attention awareness scale (maas) are described. correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the maas measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. an experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.
identification of quantitative trait loci affecting ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in an interspecific f1 poplar cross and differential expression of genes in ectomycorrhizas of the two parents: populus deltoides and populus trichocarpa truffles are symbiotic fungi that form ectomycorrhizas with plant roots. here we present evidence that at an early stage of the interaction, i.e. prior to physical contact, mycelia of the white truffle tuber borchii and the black truffle tuber melanopsorum induce alterations in root morphology of the host cistus incanus and the nonhost arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana; i.e. primary root shortening, lateral root formation, root hair stimulation). this was most likely due to the production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) and ethylene by the mycelium. application of a mixture of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and iaa fully mimicked the root morphology induced by the mycelium for both host and nonhost plants. application of the single hormones only partially mimicked it. furthermore, primary root growth was not inhibited in the arabidopsis auxin transport mutant aux1-7 by truffle metabolites while root branching was less effected in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2-lh. the double mutant aux1-7;ein2-lh displayed reduced sensitivity to fungus-induced primary root shortening and branching. in agreement with the signaling nature of truffle metabolites, increased expression of the auxin response reporter dr5∷gfp in arabidopsis root meristems subjected to the mycelium could be observed, confirming that truffles modify the endogenous hormonal balance of plants. last, we demonstrate that truffles synthesize ethylene from l-methionine probably through the α-keto-γ-(methylthio)butyric acid pathway. taken together, these results establish the central role of iaa and ethylene as signal molecules in truffle/plant interactions.
divergent androgen regulation of unfolded protein response pathways drives prostate cancer the neuroectodermal tumors neuroblastoma and melanoma represent biologically aggressive and chemoresistant cancers. the chemotherapeutic agents fenretinide and bortezomib induce apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress in these tumor types. the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the early events of er stress signaling and response pathways induced by fenretinide and bortezomib are mediated by the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eif2α)-atf4 signaling pathway. treatment of neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines with fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin resulted in induction of eif2α signaling, characterized by increased expression of phosphorylated eif2α, atf4, atf3, and gadd34. these events correlated with induction of the pro-apoptotic protein noxa. the cytotoxic response, characterized by up-regulation of noxa and cell death, was dependent on atf4, but not the er-related pro-death signaling pathways involving gadd153 or ire1. although perk-dependent phosphorylation of eif2α enhanced atf4 protein levels during er stress, cell death in response to fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin was not abrogated by inhibition of eif2α phosphorylation through perk knockdown or overexpression of wild-type eif2α. furthermore, atf4 induction in response to er stress was dependent primarily on transcriptional activation, which occurred in a perk- and phosphorylated eif2α-independent manner. these results demonstrate that atf4 mediates er stress-induced cell death of neuroectodermal tumor cells in response to fenretinide or bortezomib. understanding the complex regulation of cell death pathways in response to er stress-inducing drugs has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets, thus allowing the development of improved treatment strategies to overcome chemoresistance.
double‐blind, placebo‐controlled pilot study of adjunctive quetiapine sr in the treatment of pms/pmdd premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome, characterized by depressive, anxious, and somatic symptoms, associated to a significant reduction in social functioning and quality of life. although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and oral contraceptives show a substantial effectiveness in pmdd, a wide percentage of women affected by pmdd do not respond to those first-line treatments. we present the case of a 42-year-old woman, affected by a disabling form of pmdd, who partially responded to an ssri treatment and significantly improved after an add-on therapy with lamotrigine. we therefore suggest that lamotrigine may be an efficacious and safe augmentation strategy in severe pmdd cases showing unsatisfactory or partial response to ssri treatments.
enhanced glucotropaeolin production in hairy root cultures  of tropaeolum majus l. by combining elicitation  and precursor feeding we obtained callus, cell suspension and hairy root cultures of tropaeolum majus and we demonstrated their ability to produce glucotropaeolin and myrosinase. in hairy roots glucotropaeolin content and myrosinase activity were higher in comparison with callus, cell suspension and leaves of intact plants. in hairy root cultures the highest glucotropaeolin contents were detected on the 9th day of culture. in relation to dry weight glucotropaeolin production by hairy roots was stimulated markedly by cystein and less by phenylalanine and methyl jasmonate. cystein inhibited biomass growth so in relation to culture volume stimulating effect of cystein on glucotropaeolin yield declined. myrosinase activity was stimulated by methyl jasmonate. the ratio of myrosinase activity to glucotropaeolin content in cultures with methyl jasmonate was much higher than in cultures with cystein.
validity of italian version of the child perceptions questionnaire (cpq11-14) backgroundoral-health-related quality of life (ohrqol) instruments are being used with increasing frequency in oral health surveys. however, these instruments are not available in all countries or all languages. the availability of cross-culturally valid, multi-lingual versions of instruments is important for epidemiological research. the child perceptions questionnaire 11–14 (cpq11–14) is an ohrqol instrument that assesses the impact of oral conditions on the quality of life of children and adolescents. the objective of the current study was to carry out the cross-cultural adaptation of cpq11–14 for the brazilian portuguese language.methodsafter translation and cross-cultural adaptation, the cpq 11–14 was tested on 160 11-to-14-year-old children who were clinically and radiographically examined for the presence or absence of dental caries. the children were receiving dental care at the pediatric dental and orthodontic clinics of the federal university of minas gerais, brazil. to test the quality of the translation, 17 children answered the questionnaire. the internal consistency of the instrument was assessed by cronbach's alpha coefficient and the test-retest reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (icc).resultsthe mean cpq11–14 score were 24.5 [standard deviation (sd) 18.27] in the group with caries and 12.89 [sd 10.95] in the group without caries. median scores were 20 and 10 in the groups with and without caries, respectively (p < 0.001). significant associations were identified between caries status and all cpq domains (p < 0.05). internal reliability was confirmed by a cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.86. test-retest reliability revealed satisfactory reproducibility (icc = 0.85). the questionnaire proved to be a valid instrument. construct validity was satisfactory, demonstrating highly significant correlations with global indicators for the total scale and subscales. the cpq11–14 score was able to discriminate between different oral conditions (groups without and with untreated caries).conclusionthe present study demonstrated that the cpq11–14 is applicable to children in brazil. it has satisfactory psychometric properties, but further research is required to evaluate these properties in a population study.
existence of species complex largely reduced barcoding success for invasive species of tephritidae: a case study in bactrocera spp. backgroundvarious methods have been proposed to assign unknown specimens to known species using their dna barcodes, while others have focused on using genetic divergence thresholds to estimate “species” diversity for a taxon, without a well-developed taxonomy and/or an extensive reference library of dna barcodes. the major goals of the present work were to: a) conduct the largest species-level barcoding study of the muscidae to date and characterize the range of genetic divergence values in the northern nearctic fauna; b) evaluate the correspondence between morphospecies and barcode groupings defined using both clustering-based and threshold-based approaches; and c) use the reference library produced to address taxonomic issues.resultsour data set included 1114 individuals and their coi sequences (951 from churchill, manitoba), representing 160 morphologically-determined species from 25 genera, covering 89% of the known fauna of churchill and 23% of the nearctic fauna. following an iterative process through which all specimens belonging to taxa with anomalous divergence values and/or monophyly issues were re-examined, identity was modified for 9 taxa, including the reinstatement of phaonia luteva (walker) stat. nov. as a species distinct from phaonia errans (meigen). in the post-reassessment data set, no distinct gap was found between maximum pairwise intraspecific distances (range 0.00-3.01%) and minimum interspecific distances (range: 0.77-11.33%). nevertheless, using a clustering-based approach, all individuals within 98% of species grouped with their conspecifics with high (>95%) bootstrap support; in contrast, a maximum species discrimination rate of 90% was obtained at the optimal threshold of 1.2%. dna barcoding enabled the determination of females from 5 ambiguous species pairs and confirmed that 16 morphospecies were genetically distinct from named taxa. there were morphological differences among all distinct genetic clusters; thus, no cases of cryptic species were detected.conclusionsour findings reveal the great utility of building a well-populated, species-level reference barcode database against which to compare unknowns. when such a library is unavailable, it is still possible to obtain a fairly accurate (within ~10%) rapid assessment of species richness based upon a barcode divergence threshold alone, but this approach is most accurate when the threshold is tuned to a particular taxon.
ancient waste pits with wood ash irreversibly increase crop production in central europe tree species and wood ash application in plantations of short-rotation woody crops (srwc) may have important effects on the soil productive capacity through their influence on soil organic matter (som) and exchangeable cations. an experiment was conducted to assess changes in soil c and n contents and ph within the 0–50 cm depth, and exchangeable cation (ca2+, mg2+, k+, and na+) and extractable acidity concentrations within the 0–10 cm depth. the effects of different species (european larch [larix decidua p. mill.], aspen [populus tremula l. × populus tremuloides michx.], and four poplar [populus spp.] clones) and wood ash applications (0, 9, and 18 mg ha−1) on soil properties were evaluated, using a common garden experiment (n = 70 stands) over 7 years of management in michigan’s upper peninsula. soils were of the onaway series (fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid inceptic hapludalfs). the nm-6 poplar clone had the greatest soil c and n contents in almost all ash treatment levels. soil c contents were 7.5, 19.4, and 10.7 mg c ha−1 greater under the nm-6 poplar than under larch in the ash-free, medium-, and high-level plots, respectively. within the surface layer, ash application increased soil c and n contents (p < 0.05) through the addition of about 0.7 mg c ha−1 and 3 kg n ha−1 with the 9 mg ha−1 ash application (twofold greater c and n amounts were added with the 18 mg ha−1 application). during a decadal time scale, tree species had no effects—except for k+—on the concentrations of the exchangeable cations, ph, and extractable acidity. in contrast, ash application increased soil ph and the concentration of ca2+ (p < 0.05), from 5.2 ± 0.4 cmolc kg−1 (ash-free plots) to 8.6 ± 0.4 cmolc kg−1 (high-level ash plots), and tended to increase the concentration of mg2+ (p < 0.1), while extractable acidity was reduced (p < 0.05) from 5.6 ± 0.2 cmolc kg−1 (ash-free plots) to 3.7 ± 0.2 cmolc kg−1 (high-level plots). wood ash application, within certain limits, not only had a beneficial effect on soil properties important to the long-term productivity of fast-growing plantations but also enhanced long-term soil c sequestration.
a mouse model of non-motor symptoms in parkinson's disease: focus on pharmacological interventions targeting affective dysfunctions parkinson's disease (pd) is frequently accompanied by symptoms of depression and anxiety. however, the relationship between anxiety and depression has not been rigorously defined in these patients. in this study, 42 patients with pd and 21 matched medical controls were evaluated using dsm-iii-r criteria and a variety of psychiatric rating scales. twelve (29%) pd patients but only one medical control had a formal anxiety disorder diagnosis. of the 12 patients with pd who had an anxiety disorder diagnosis, 11 (92%) had a comorbid depressive disorder diagnosis. of the 18 patients with a depressive disorder, 12 (67%) also had an anxiety disorder diagnosis. furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis found that the depression measure explained 44% of the variance in anxiety measures whereas neither the severity of illness variables nor the levodopa dose contributed significantly to the variance. this study suggests that the excess anxiety found in pd patients is unlikely to be primarily a psychologic reaction to the illness or a side effect of levodopa treatment. rather, we suggest that anxiety and depression are related manifestations of the underlying neurochemical changes of pd itself.
effect of the cauliflower or transgene on carotenoid accumulation and chromoplast formation in transgenic potato tubers. in order to enhance the carotenoid content of potato tubers, transgenic potato plants have been produced expressing an erwinia uredovora crtb gene encoding phytoene synthase, specifically in the tuber of solanum tuberosum l. cultivar desiree which normally produces tubers containing c. 5.6 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw and also in solanum phureja l. cv. mayan gold which has a tuber carotenoid content of typically 20 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw. in developing tubers of transgenic crtb desiree lines, carotenoid levels reached 35 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw and the balance of carotenoids changed radically compared with controls: beta-carotene levels in the transgenic tubers reached c. 11 microg g(-1) dw, whereas control tubers contained negligible amounts and lutein accumulated to a level 19-fold higher than empty-vector transformed controls. the crtb gene was also transformed into s. phureja (cv. mayan gold), again resulting in an increase in total carotenoid content to 78 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw in the most affected transgenic line. in these tubers, the major carotenoids were violaxanthin, lutein, antheraxanthin, and beta-carotene. no increases in expression levels of the major carotenoid biosynthetic genes could be detected in the transgenic tubers, despite the large increase in carotenoid accumulation. microarray analysis was used to identify a number of genes that were consistently up- or down-regulated in transgenic crtb tubers compared with empty vector controls. the implications of these data from a nutritional standpoint and for further modifications of tuber carotenoid content are discussed.
increasing trend of reflux esophagitis and decreasing trend of helicobacter pylori infection in patients from a multiethnic asian country the aim of this study was to determine, first, whether racial differences exist in the seroprevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in singapore, and second, whether these differences correlate with racial differences in peptic ulcer frequency. a commercial serological test for immunoglobulin (ig)g antibody to h. pylori which was 90% sensitive and 83% specific in our population was used to screen 403 adult blood donors of chinese, malay and indian origin, aged between 15–60 years. serum specimens from 84 paediatric patients admitted to the paediatrics department, national university of singapore, with non‐gastroenterological illnesses were also tested. in all three races, seroprevalence of h. pylori increased with age. indians have the highest prevalence of infection followed by chinese and malays. peptic ulcer prevalences are known to be highest in chinese, followed by indians and malays. the malays have the lowest prevalence of h. pylori and peptic ulcer among the three races in singapore. indians have a higher prevalence of h. pylori antibodies but a lower frequency of peptic ulcer than the chinese. racial differences in peptic ulcer frequency between chinese and indians are not explained by the prevalence of h. pylori infection; other environmental or genetic factors may be involved.
an estimation of the protein requirements of iberian x duroc 50:50 crossbred growing pigs. the objective of the present experiment was to define the form of the relationship between varying levels of energy intake at constant, high protein intake and the performance of young pigs. by doing so it was expected that we could distinguish between four models that predict the pig's responses to its diet as rates of protein and lipid retention. forty young pigs were assigned at 12 kg live weight either to an initial slaughter group (n 8) or to one of four allowances of starch intake at a constant intake of a high-protein feed (with 345 g crude protein (nitrogen x 6.25)/kg food). half the pigs were killed after 4 weeks and half after 8 weeks on the treatments; at each slaughter point on each treatment half the pigs were entire males and half were females. increasing the intake of starch (energy) resulted in significant increases in the rates of live weight, empty-body, protein and lipid gains of pigs slaughtered at both stages. there was no minimum positive lipid:protein ratio in the gain of the pigs. male pigs deposited more protein and less lipid than females but this effect of sex on protein and lipid retention was seen only on the two highest allowances of starch intake. the calculated efficiency of protein utilization increased with increasing starch intake up to a maximum of 0.81, when probably the energy:protein in the diet became non-limiting. the results led to the rejection of two of the models that predict the rates of protein and lipid retention as responses to protein and energy intake, but the two remaining models could not be rejected, at least qualitatively.
real-time imaging of huntingtin aggregates diverting target search and gene transcription stress granules are membrane-less organelles composed of rna-binding proteins (rbps) and rna. functional impairment of stress granules has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy-diseases that are characterized by fibrillar inclusions of rbps. genetic evidence suggests a link between persistent stress granules and the accumulation of pathological inclusions. here, we demonstrate that the disease-related rbp hnrnpa1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (llps) into protein-rich droplets mediated by a low complexity sequence domain (lcd). while the lcd of hnrnpa1 is sufficient to mediate llps, the rna recognition motifs contribute to llps in the presence of rna, giving rise to several mechanisms for regulating assembly. importantly, while not required for llps, fibrillization is enhanced in protein-rich droplets. we suggest that lcd-mediated llps contributes to the assembly of stress granules and their liquid properties and provides a mechanistic link between persistent stress granules and fibrillar protein pathology in disease.
effect of comt val108/158met genotype on risk for polydipsia in chronic patients with schizophrenia this case report concerns two schizophrenic patients with "psychogenic" polydipsia, without any underlying somatic disease. although case a showed a correlation between excessive water intake and severity of psychomotor disturbance, this could not be safely diagnosed as a water intoxication because the sodium serum level was normal. the lowered sodium serum level in case b, however, allowed us to conclude that the manifestation of grand mal was a sign of a genuine water intoxication. 27 casuistic studies on 67 patients with the syndrome of self-induced water intoxication in schizophrenics are then reviewed. finally, a variety of diagnostic and pathogenetic problems of this syndrome is discussed, with special reference to the role of inadequate adh secretion.
deficiency of the metalloproteinase-disintegrin adam8 is associated with thymic hyper-cellularity although notch plays a crucial role in t cell development, regulation of notch signaling in the thymus is not well understood. kuzbanian, an adam protease, has been implicated in the cleavage of both notch receptors and the notch ligand, delta. in this study we show that the expression of a dominant-negative form of kuzbanian (dnkuz) leads to reduced tcrβ expression in double-negative thymocytes and to a partial block between the double-negative to double-positive stages of development. these defects were rescued by overexpression of delta-1 on thymocytes. mixed chimeras showed a cell-autonomous block by dnkuz, but non-cell-autonomous rescue by delta-1. this suggests that dnkuz impairs notch signaling in receiving cells, and increasing delta-1 on sending cells overcomes this defect. interestingly, the expression of an activated form of notch-1 rescued some, but not all, the defects in dnkuz tg mice. our data suggest that multiple notch-dependent steps in early thymocyte development require kuzbanian, but differ in the involvement of other notch signaling components.
what causes ior? attention or perception? – manipulating cue and target luminance in either blocked or mixed condition after presentation of a peripheral cue, facilitation at the cued location is followed by inhibition of return (ior). it has been recently proposed that ior may originate at different processing stages for manual and ocular responses, with manual ior resulting from inhibited attentional orienting, and ocular ior resulting form inhibited motor preparation. contrary to this interpretation, we found an effect of target contrast on saccadic ior. the effect of contrast decreased with increasing reaction times (rts) for saccades, but not for manual key-press responses. this may have masked the effect of contrast on ior with saccades in previous studies (hunt and kingstone in j exp psychol hum percept perform 29:1068–1074, 2003) because only mean rts were considered. we also found that background luminance strongly influenced the effects of gap and target contrast on ior.
effects of methylphenidate and morphine on delay-discount functions obtained within sessions. this experiment evaluated the effects of methylphenidate on reinforced responding in rats. in each session the subjects (rats) earned reinforcement on seven different variable-interval reinforcement schedules. the average intervals varied from 108 to 3 s and provided reinforcement rates ranging from about 30 to 1100/h. response rate was a negatively accelerated function of reinforcement rate. low doses of methylphenidate (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) increased responding maintained by the four leanest schedules, but had little effect on responding maintained by the three densest schedules. in contrast, an 8.0 mg/kg dose increased responding maintained by the three densest schedules and slightly decreased responding maintained by leaner schedules. a quantitative model of reinforced responding, referred to as the matching law or response strength equation, was fitted to the data. this equation has two parameters. on the basis of previous experiments, one was used to measure changes in reinforcement efficacy and the other was used to measure changes in motor performance. the 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg doses changed the reinforcement parameter in the same way as did increases in deprivation and reward magnitude. the 8.0 mg/kg dose changed the motor parameter in the same was as did decreases in lever weight. it was concluded that methylphenidate increases reinforcement efficacy, and that the highest dose changed the topography of responding. the results are discussed in terms of the response strength equation, the rate dependency principle, and the question of how to interpret changes in reinforcement efficacy and motor performance.
neighborhood deprivation and maternal psychological distress during pregnancy: a multilevel analysis objectives we investigated the relationship between the depressive symptoms of older adults over time and the characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they live.   methods we surveyed a random sample of 1325 new york city residents aged 50 years or older in 2005 and conducted 808 follow-up interviews in 2007. we assessed the compositional characteristics of the respondents' neighborhoods at a census-tract level and determined the relationships between these characteristics and changes in respondents' depressive symptoms.   results in multivariable models that adjusted for individual-level covariates including income, a range of neighborhood characteristics predicted worsening depressive symptoms. factor analysis suggested that these characteristics operated in 3 clusters: neighborhood socioeconomic influences, residential stability, and racial/ethnic composition, with positive neighborhood socioeconomic influences being significantly protective against worsening symptoms. life stressors, personality trait neuroticism, african american race, and daily baseline contact with social networks were also associated with worsening symptoms.   conclusions an older adult's neighborhood of residence is an important determinant of his or her mental health. those making efforts to improve mental health among the elderly need to consider the role of residential context in improving or impairing mental health.
inhibition of bladder cancer invasion by sp1‐mediated btg2 expression via inhibition of dna methyltransferase 1 dye-ligand chromatography on cibacron blue f3ga-agarose has been used to resolve two species of dna (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase from nuclear extracts of uninduced friend murine erythroleukemia cells. each species has been highly purified; the activities in the first and second peaks were associated with polypeptides of mr 150,000 and 175,000, respectively. analysis of substrate specificity with synthetic dnas and restriction fragments of phi x174 replicative form dna and pbr322 dna showed that neither enzyme had dependence on the sequence context of cpg dinucleotides; poly(dg-dc) had the greatest methyl-accepting activity of any unmethylated dna substrate tested. de novo methylation by both enzymes was inefficient relative to methylation of hemimethylated sites. methyl-accepting activity was strongly dependent on dna chain length. this observation suggests that binding to dna, followed by one-dimensional diffusion of enzyme along the dna molecule, is important in the mechanism by which dna methyltransferase locates its recognition sites.
cupric ions induce the oxidation and trigger the aggregation of human superoxide dismutase 1 the kinetics of bovine cu,zn superoxide dismutase were studied by pulse radiolysis. to ensure the absence of catalytically active free copper, commercially obtained holo-superoxide dismutase was demetallated, and the apo-superoxide dismutase concentrations were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry prior to reconstitution with defined amounts of copper and zinc. the catalytic rate constant was determined as a function of ionic strength over the range of 4-154 mm, and of the copper and zinc content. the catalytic rate constant increases with ionic strength up to (1.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) m(-1) s(-1) at an ionic strength of 15 mm, and then decreases. at ph 7 and 50 mm ionic strength, k = (1.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) m(-1) s(-1), and at a physiologically relevant ionic strength of 150 mm, it is (0.7 +/- 0.1) x 10 (9) m(-1) s(-1). the effect of ionic strength is ascribed to the inhomogeneous electric field generated by the surface charges of superoxide dismutase. the value of the catalytic rate constant at 50 mm is ca. 2-fold smaller than earlier values reported in the literature. the relationship between copper content and the catalytic rate constant shows that addition of more than a stoichiometric amount of copper cannot be masked efficiently by edta. the possibility exists that earlier reported values were based on experiments contaminated with trace amounts of copper.
tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 are possibly involved in plasmodium vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia in southern pakistani population abstract interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine which shows a wide variety of biologic functions on various tissues and cells. indeed, il-6 acts not only on b cells but also on t cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, etc. in this review, i have attempted to summarize the new data concerning the effect of il-6 on megakaryocytes and platelets.
results of an open posterior bone block procedure for recurrent posterior shoulder instability after a short- and long-time follow-up our purpose has been to describe an original surgical technique without describing all the problems concerning the posterior instability. the original technique has a double effect: active with the muscular flap and passively mechanic, if necessary, by the bone graft. five patients have been treated with this technique with a follow-up of one year and a half. 4 females and 1 male with an average age of 32 years 1/2. 2 were recurrent posterior instability, one unintentional and 2 intentional subluxations. 2 were epileptics. in all cases, the disparition of the instability was obtained. full range of movement and sport were resumed at the former level. on x-rays, the humeral head was centered. by its double mechanism, active with the muscular flap and possibly passive with the bone graft, this technic is reliable to treat the majority of posterior instability. it combines the way of action searched in physiotherapy and capsulomyoplasties to center the humeral head and this one by the bone graft in case of posterior glenoid fracture or dysplasia. it doesn't have the insufficiencies of physiotherapy or capsulomyoplasties in posterior traumatic instabilities, nor from the classical bone graft over the glenoid posterior wall, cause of osteoarthritis and pain.
maternal separation anxiety as a regulator of infants' sleep. the relationships between aspects of parenting and infants' sleep patterns were studied longitudinally with 81 mother-child pairs. mothers' parenting orientation at 6 months was defined using the facilitator-regulator distinction. when the infants were 12 months old, mother and child participated in a laboratory-based developmental assessment which involved a brief separation episode. upon reunion, mothers reported on their concerns during separation; they also described their child's sleep. it was found that high maternal separation anxiety was related to night waking. in addition, night waking was more frequent among first born babies of facilitators compared with regulators. how maternal separation anxiety and care-giving orientation regulate aspects of the child's sleep awaits further explanation.
protease modulation of the activity of the epithelial sodium channel expressed in xenopus oocytes summarythe mammalian urinary bladder epithelium accommodates volume changes by the insertion and withdrawal of cytoplasmic vesicles. both apical membrane (which is entirely composed of fused vesicles) and the cytoplasmic vesicles contain three types of ionic conductances, one amiloride sensitive, an-other a cation-selective conductance and the third a cation conductance which seems to partition between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. the transport properties of the apical membrane (which has been exposed to urine in vivo) differ from the cytoplasmic vesicles by possessing a lower density of amiloride-sensitive channels and a variable level of leak conductance. it was previously shown that glandular kallikrein was able to hydrolyze epithelial sodium channels into the leak conductance and that this leak conductance was further degraded into a channel which partitioned between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. this report investigates whether kallikrein is the only urinary constituent capable of altering the apical membrane ionic permeability or whether other proteases or ionic conditions also irreversible modify apical membrane permeability.alterations of mucosal ph, urea concentrations, calcium concentrations or osmolarity did not irreversible affect the apical membrane ionic conductances. however, urokinase and plasmin (both serine proteases found in mammalian urine) were found to cause an irreversible loss of amiloride-sensitive current, a variable change in the leak current as well as the appearance of a third conductance which was unstable in the apical membrane and appears to partition between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. amiloride protects the amiloride-sensitive conductance from hydrolysis but does not protect the leak pathway. neither channel is protected by sodium. fluctuation analysis demonstrated that the loss of amiloride-sensitive current was due to a decrease in the sodium-channel density and not a change in the single-channel current. assuming a simple model of sequential degradation, estimates of single-channel currents and conductances for both the leak channel and unstable leak channel are determined.
the neisseria gonorrhoeae obg protein is an essential ribosome-associated gtpase and a potential drug target when grown under anaerobic conditions, neisseria gonorrhoeae, the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, expresses several novel outer membrane proteins. one of these, pan 1, has an apparent molecular mass of 54 kda in electrophoresis and is recognized by serum samples from patients with gonococcal infection. the presence of antibodies to this protein in patient sera suggests that pan 1 is expressed during gonococcal infection and, more importantly, that n. gonorrhoeae grows anaerobically in vivo. we have cloned the pan 1 structural gene, ania, by screening a gonococcal lambda gt11 expression library with monospecific, polyclonal anti-pan 1 antiserum. three distinct immunoreactive recombinants, containing overlapping fragments of dna, were isolated and confirmed to be coding for pan 1 protein sequences. northern (rna blot) hybridization of an insert from an ania recombinant to total gonococcal cellular rna revealed the presence of a 1.5-kb transcript that was specific to rna from anaerobically grown gonococci, indicating that the ania gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and is monocistronic. to characterize the ania gene, we have sequenced the entire 2-kb region spanned by the overlapping recombinants. we have also performed primer extension analysis on rna isolated from aerobically and anaerobically grown gonococci in order to define the ania promoter region. two putative primer extension products specific to organisms grown anaerobically were identified by homology to known escherichia coli promoter sequences, suggesting that the regulation of ania expression involves multiple promoter regions.
prediction of drug clearance and drug-drug interactions in microscale cultures of human hepatocytes various incubation conditions of human hepatocytes were compared for their accuracy in predicting the in vivo hepatic clearance (clh) of model compounds. the test compounds were the highly cleared, low protein bound naloxone (in vivo clh = 25 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.6), the medium clearance, highly protein bound midazolam (clh = 12 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.04) and the low clearance, highly protein bound bosentan (clh = 3.9 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.02). each compound was tested in three ‘hepatocyte systems’, using resections from three donors, in the presence and absence of human serum. those hepatocyte systems were: conventional primary cultures, freshly isolated suspensions and cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes. except for a twofold overestimated clh for bosentan from conventional primary cultures, and despite variable cryopreservation recoveries, similar predictions of clh were recorded with all hepatocyte systems. moreover, the clh values obtained with cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes were similar to those obtained with freshly isolated suspensions. for midazolam and bosentan, the predicted in vivo clh was markedly higher in the presence of serum, whereas serum had little influence on the scaled-up clh of naloxone. in vivo, clh was properly approached for naloxone and bosentan (particularly from experiments in the presence of serum), but it was strongly underestimated for midazolam (particularly in the absence of serum). additional compounds need to be investigated to confirm the above findings as well as to assess why the clearances of some highly protein-bound compounds are still considerably underestimated.
glur1 phosphorylation and persistent expression of levodopa-induced motor response alterations in the hemi-parkinsonian rat background the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) kinase plays a key role in translational control of a subset of mrnas through regulation of its initiation step. in neurons, mtor is present at the synaptic region, where it modulates the activity-dependent expression of locally-translated proteins independently of mrna synthesis. indeed, mtor is necessary for different forms of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (ltm) formation. however, little is known about the time course of mtor activation and the extracellular signals governing this process or the identity of the proteins whose translation is regulated by this kinase, during mnemonic processing. methodology/principal findings here we show that consolidation of inhibitory avoidance (ia) ltm entails mtor activation in the dorsal hippocampus at the moment of and 3 h after training and is associated with a rapid and rapamycin-sensitive increase in ampa receptor glur1 subunit expression, which was also blocked by intra-hippocampal delivery of glur1 antisense oligonucleotides (aso). in addition, we found that pre- or post-training administration of function-blocking anti-bdnf antibodies into dorsal ca1 hampered ia ltm retention, abolished the learning-induced biphasic activation of mtor and its readout, p70s6k and blocked glur1 expression, indicating that bdnf is an upstream factor controlling mtor signaling during fear-memory consolidation. interestingly, bdnf aso hindered ltm retention only when given into dorsal ca1 1 h after but not 2 h before training, suggesting that bdnf controls the biphasic requirement of mtor during ltm consolidation through different mechanisms: an early one involving bdnf already available at the moment of training, and a late one, happening around 3 h post-training that needs de novo synthesis of this neurotrophin. conclusions/significance in conclusion, our findings demonstrate that: 1) mtor-mediated mrna translation is required for memory consolidation during at least two restricted time windows; 2) this kinase acts downstream bdnf in the hippocampus and; 3) it controls the increase of synaptic glur1 necessary for memory consolidation.
investigating cooperative behavior in ecological settings: an eeg hyperscanning study background performing mission tasks in a simulator influences many neurophysiological measures. quantitative assessments of electroencephalography (eeg) and electrocardiography (ecg) have made it possible to develop indicators of mental workload and to estimate relative physiological responses to cognitive requirements.   objective to evaluate the effects of mental workload without actual physical risk, we studied the cortical and cardiovascular changes that occurred during simulated flight.   methods there were 12 pilots (8 novices and 4 experts) who simulated a flight composed of 10 sequences that induced several different mental workload levels. eeg was recorded at 12 electrode sites during rest and flight sequences; ecg activity was also recorded. subjective tests were used to evaluate anxiety and vigilance levels.   results theta band activity was lower during the two simulated flight rest sequences than during visual and instrument flight sequences at central, parietal, and occipital sites (p < 0.05). on the other hand, rest sequences resulted in higher beta (at the c4 site; p < 0.05) and gamma (at the central, parietal, and occipital sites; p < 0.05) power than active segments. the mean heart rate (hr) was not significantly different during any simulated flight sequence, but hr was lower for expert subjects than for novices. the subjective tests revealed no significant anxiety and high values for vigilance levels before and during flight.   conclusions the different flight sequences performed on the simulator resulted in electrophysiological changes that expressed variations in mental workload. these results corroborate those found during study of real flights, particularly during sequences requiring the heaviest mental workload.
perinatal factors associated with the development of cow's milk protein allergy. the concentrations of beta-lactoglobulin was measured in the sera of 47 preterm an term neonates during the first few days of life under standardised conditions after feeding with a cows' milk'based formula. preterm neonates, particularly those of less than 33 weeks' gestation, had higher serum concentrations of beta-lactoglobulin than term neonates given an equivalent mild feed. prior feeding with breast milk did not diminish the amount of beta-lactoglobulin absorbed. our results suggest tha te ability of the gastrointestinal tract to exclude antigenically intact food proteins increases with gestational age and that gut closure occurs normally before birth in man.
mechanical analysis of arterial plaques in native geometry with oct wall motion analysis. background:the composition of an atherosclerotic plaque is considered more important than the degree of stenosis. an unstable lesion may rupture and cause an acute thrombotic reaction. most of these lesions contain a large lipid pool covered by an inflamed thin fibrous cap. the stress in the cap increases with decreasing cap thickness and increasing macrophage infiltration. intravascular ultrasound (ivus) palpography might be an ideal technique to assess the mechanical properties of high-risk plaques.technique:palpography assesses the local mechanical properties of tissue using its deformation caused by the intraluminal pressure.in vitro validation:the technique was validated in vitro using diseased human coronary and femoral arteries. especially between fibrous and fatty tissue, a highly significant difference in strain (p = 0.0012) was found. additionally, the predictive value to identify the vulnerable plaque was investigated. a high-strain region at the lumen-vessel wall boundary has an 88% sensitivity and 89% specificity for identifying such plaques.in vivo validation:in vivo, the technique was validated in an atherosclerotic yucatan minipig animal model. this study also revealed higher strain values in fatty than fibrous plaques (p < 0.001). the presence of a high-strain region at the lumenplaque interface has a high predictive value to identify macrophages.patient studies:patient studies revealed high-strain values (1–2%) in thin-cap fibrous atheroma. calcified material showed low strain values (0–0.2%). with the development of three-dimensional (3-d) palpography, identification of highstrain spots over the full length of a coronary artery becomes available.conclusion:intravascular palpography is a unique tool to assess lesion composition and vulnerability. the development of 3-d palpography provides a technique that may develop into a clinical tool to identify the high-risk plaque.hintergrund:die zusammensetzung einer atherosklerotischen plaque wird als wichtiger erachtet als deren stenosegrad. eine instabile läsion kann aufbrechen und eine thrombotische reaktion auslösen. die mehrzahl dieser läsionen enthält einen großen lipidreichen kern, der von einer dünnen entzündeten kappe bedeckt ist. der stress in der kappe erhöht sich mit abnehmender dicke der kappe und zunehmender makrophageninfiltration. die intravaskuläre ultraschall- (ivus-)palpographie könnte die ideale technik zur beurteilung der mechanischen eigenschaften von hochrisikoplaques darstellen.technik:die palpographie erfasst die lokalen mechanischen eigenschaften von gewebe mit hilfe der durch den intravaskulären druck erzeugten deformation.in-vitro-validierung:die methode wurde durch untersuchung erkrankter koronar- und femoralarterien validiert. insbesondere zwischen fibrösem und fetthaltigem gewebe ließ sich ein hochsignifikanter unterschied bezüglich der gewebsdehnung feststellen (p = 0,0012). zudem wurde der prädiktive wert für die diagnose einer vulnerablen plaque untersucht. eine stelle mit hoher dehnung an der gefäßoberfläche hat eine sensitivität von 88% und eine spezifität von 89% für die erkennung solcher plaques.in-vivo-validierung:in vivo wurde die technik in einem atherosklerotischen yucatan-minischwein-modell validiert. auch diese untersuchung zeigte höhere dehnungswerte in fetthaltigen gegenüber fibrösen plaques (p < 0,001). zudem hat das vorliegen hoher dehnungswerte an der plaqueoberfläche einen hohen prädiktiven wert für die erkennung von makrophagen.patientenstudien:patientenstudien ergaben hohe dehnungswerte (1–2%) in fetthaltigen plaques mit dünner kappe. kalzifiziertes material zeigte niedrige dehnungswerte (0–0,2%). durch die entwicklung der dreidimensionalen (3-d) palpographie wird die identifikation von stellen mit hohen dehnungswerten im kompletten koronarsystem möglich.schlussfolgerung:wie keine andere methode gestattet die intravaskuläre palpographie, zusammensetzung und vulnerabilität einer läsion zu beurteilen. die entwicklung der 3-d-palpographie stellt eine technik zur verfügung, die sich zu einem klinischen hilfsmittel zur identifizierung von hochrisikoplaques entwickeln könnte.
preparative and quantitative isolation of plasma lipoproteins: rapid, single discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation in a vertical rotor. abstract the separation of plasma lipoproteins into vldl, ldl, and hdl by a single 24-hr ultracentrifugation in swinging-bucket rotors is described. the mean recovery of loaded lipoprotein cholesterol is 89.3 ± 1.3%. the method employs a discontinuous salt gradient and separates vldl, ldl, and hdl as verified by cellulose acetate- and immuno-electrophoresis. the method offers some advantages for research applications.
differential adaptive diffusion: understanding diversity and learning whom to trust in viral marketing the new social media sites — blogs, wikis, flickr and digg, among others — underscore the transformation of the web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. digg is a social news aggregator which allows users to submit links to, vote on and discuss news stories. each day digg selects a handful of stories to feature on its front page. rather than rely on the opinion of a few editors, digg aggregates opinions of thousands of its users to decide which stories to promote to the front page. digg users can designate other users as “friends” and easily track friends’ activities: what new stories they submitted, commented on or read. the friends interface acts as a social filtering system, recommending to user stories his or her friends liked or found interesting. by tracking the votes received by newly submitted stories over time, we showed that social filtering is an effective information filtering approach. specifically, we showed that (a) users tend to like stories submitted by friends and (b) users tend to like stories their friends read and liked. social filtering is a promising new technology that can be used to personalize and tailor information to individual users: for example, through personal front pages.
impact of different water activities (aw) adjusted by solutes on high pressure high temperature inactivation of bacillus amyloliquefaciens spores the influence of ph, aw, l-alanine, and fat concentration of milk on the initiation of germination and inactivation by high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) (250 mpa at 25 degrees c for 15 min and 690 mpa at 40 degrees c for 2 min) of bacillus cereus sporulated at 20, 30 and 37 degrees c was investigated. b. cereus sporulated at the lowest temperature was found to be the most resistant to the initiation of germination and inactivation by hhp. at ambient pressure, the rate and extension of germination induced by l-alanine were also lower in b. cereus sporulated at 20 than 30 or 37 degrees c. the optimum ph for the germination and inactivation of b. cereus depended on the sporulation temperature. at 250 mpa the extent of germination for the three suspensions increased with higher ph. at 690 mpa, the ph barely affected the germination of b. cereus sporulated at 20 degrees c (3 log cycles), but the inactivation increased as the ph of the medium was lowered. after the same treatment, pressure optimally initiated the germination of b. cereus sporulated at 30 and 37 degrees c (6-7 log cycles) around neutral ph. higher inactivation was obtained at ph 6. high concentrations of sucrose protected the spores from the germinating and inactivating effect of hhp. at aw 0.92, no germination was detected when the spores were pressurized at 250 mpa, and only 1 log cycle of b. cereus sporulated at 20 and 30 degrees c and 2 log cycles of b. cereus sporulated at 37 degrees c were germinated at 690 mpa. in addition, no inactivation was observed at aw 0.92 even at 690 mpa. the presence of l-alanine in the medium of pressurization increased the germination initiated by hhp at 250 mpa, but not at 690 mpa. a combination of 250 mpa at 25 degrees c with l-alanine (100 mm) was found to give an additive response. the initiation of germination and inactivation by hhp were not affected by the fat concentration of the milk.
are there health benefits associated with comprehensive smoke-free laws background— secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of acute myocardial infarction (ami). one study (helena, mont) examined the issue and found a decrease in ami associated with a smoke-free ordinance. we sought to determine the impact of a smoke-free ordinance on ami admission rates in another geographically isolated community (pueblo, colo). methods and results— we assessed ami hospitalizations in pueblo during a 3-year period, 1.5 years before and 1.5 years after implementation of a smoke-free ordinance. we compared the ami hospitalization rates among individuals residing within city limits, the area where the ordinance applied, versus those outside city limits. we also compared ami rates during this time period with another geographically isolated but proximal community, el paso county, colo, that did not have an ordinance. a total of 855 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of primary ami in pueblo between january 1, 2002, and december 31, 2004. a reduction in ami hospitalizations was observed in the period after the ordinance among pueblo city limit residents (relative risk [rr]=0.73, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.63 to 0.85). no significant changes in ami rates were observed among residents outside city limits (rr=0.85, 95% ci 0.63 to 1.16) or in el paso county during the same period (rr=0.97, 95% ci 0.89 to 1.06). the reduction in ami rate within pueblo differed significantly from changes in the external control group (el paso county) even after adjustment for seasonal trends (p<0.001). conclusions— a public ordinance reducing exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with a decrease in ami hospitalizations in pueblo, colo, which supports previous data from a smaller study.
the effects of constraining eye movements on visually evoked steering responses during walking in a virtual environment a fundamental property of the human brain is the ability to make predictions of future sensory and motor events. we have recently found that steering manoeuvres when walking along curvilinear trajectories are controlled by an anticipatory guidance of the direction of head (and eyes). however it is unclear whether a time-related or space-related signal triggers such anticipatory head orienting movements. by simulating navigation along a multi-legged virtual corridor we show that anticipatory orienting movements are triggered (in standing subjects) by reaching specific locations rather than by the time to the approaching corridor's bend. similar to what happens in car driving, specific spatial features of the route rather than time to collision seem to drive steering.
a flash-lag effect in random motion a flash that is presented aligned with a moving stimulus appears to lag behind the position of the moving stimulus. this flash-lag phenomenon reflects a processing advantage for moving stimuli (metzger, w. (1932) psychologische forschung 16, 176-200; mackay, d. m. (1958) nature 181, 507-508; nijhawan, r. (1994) nature 370, 256-257; purushothaman, g., patel, s.s., bedell, h.e., & ogmen, h. (1998) nature 396, 424; whitney, d. & murakami, i. (1998) nature neuroscience 1, 656-657). the present study measures the sensitivity of the illusion to unpredictable changes in the direction of motion. a moving stimulus translated upwards and then made a 90 degrees turn leftward or rightward. the flash-lag illusion was measured and it was found that, although the change in direction was unpredictable, the flash was still perceived to lag behind the moving stimulus at all points along the trajectory, a finding that is at odds with the extrapolation hypothesis (nijhawan, r. (1994) nature 370, 256-257). the results suggest that there is a shorter latency of the neural response to motion even during unpredictable changes in direction. the latency facilitation therefore appears to be omnidirectional rather than specific to a predictable path of motion (grzywacz, n. m. & amthor, f. r. (1993) journal of neurophysiology 69, 2188-2199).
cytotoxicity of different sized tio2 nanoparticles in mouse macrophages nanotitanium dioxide (tio2) is an important industrial material that is widely used as an additive in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants. although the small size of the tio2 nanoparticle is useful in various applications, the biosafety of this material needs to be evaluated. in this study, mouse fibroblast (l929) cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of different concentrations (3-600 microg/ml) of homogeneous and weakly aggregated tio2 nanoparticles in aqueous solution. the l929 cells became round and even shrank as the concentration of tio2 nanoparticles increased. moreover, tio2 nanoparticle-treated cells had condensed fragmented chromatin or were directly necrosed, as observed by acridine orange (ao) staining. the transmission electron microscopy (tem) analysis showed that in cells cultured in a medium containing 300 microg/ml tio2, the number of lysosomes increased, and some cytoplasmic organelles were damaged. in addition, there was a significant increase in oxidative stress at higher tio2 nanoparticle concentrations (>60 microg/ml). as the concentration of tio2 nanoparticles increased in the culture medium, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) increased, while those of methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (mtt), glutathione (gsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod) decreased. a possible mechanism for the cytotoxicity of tio2 nanoparticles is also discussed.
bdnf overexpression in mouse hippocampal astrocytes promotes local neurogenesis and elicits anxiolytic-like activities preclinical data support the view that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and serotonergic systems regulate circuits involved in affective disorders. the present study examined neurochemical and behavioural consequences of an acute intrahippocampal injection of bdnf combined with an antidepressant by using in-vivo intracerebral microdialysis in the ventral hippocampus (vhi) in conscious mice and behavioural paradigms predictive of antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects [the mouse forced swim test (fst), the open-field (of) paradigm and the elevated plus maze (epm)]. neurochemical data revealed that bdnf (100 ng) potentiated the effects of the systemic administration of a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (ssri; paroxetine 4 mg/kg i.p.) and that of a locally applied citalopram perfusion on dialysate 5-ht levels in the vhi. these neurochemical changes correlated with behavioural data since, in the fst, antidepressant-like activity of paroxetine as measured on swimming behaviour was potentiated by bdnf. these data suggest an interesting synergy between bdnf and ssri on antidepressant-like activity. furthermore, in both the of and epm paradigms bdnf induced an anxiogenic-like activity, whereas paroxetine prevented this effect. finally, the neurochemical and behavioural effects of bdnf on the serotonergic system might occur at both pre- and post-synaptic levels since by using in-situ hybridization, we showed that trkb-r mrna was expressed in the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe nucleus in adult mice. taken together the neurochemical and behavioural effects of bdnf suggest that these behavioural changes were mediated by increases in 5-ht neurotransmission in vhi. thus a bdnf+ssri combination may offer new alternatives to treat mood disorders.
clinical field-strength mri of amyloid plaques induced by low-level cholesterol feeding in rabbits beta-amyloid and alz-50 immunocytochemical reactivity were determined in the brains of rabbits fed either a control or 2% cholesterol diet. control rabbits demonstrated no accumulation of intracellular immunolabeled beta-amyloid within 3 min after death. in animals fed the experimental diet for 4, 6, and 8 weeks (postmortem interval < 3 min), there was an increasingly mild-to-moderate-to-severe accumulation of intracellular immunolabeled beta-amyloid. whether or not beta-amyloid is causally linked to processes leading to dementia, it is related in some way to the prime cause of human death; heart disease. hypercholesterolemic rabbits may provide an animal model to study altered beta-app metabolism leading to alzheimer-like beta-amyloid accumulation xe03and extracellular deposition in brain.
rosaceae conserved orthologous sequences marker polymorphism in sweet cherry germplasm and construction of a snp-based map backgrounddomestication and breeding involve the selection of particular phenotypes, limiting the genomic diversity of the population and creating a bottleneck. these effects can be precisely estimated when the location of domestication is established. few analyses have focused on understanding the genetic consequences of domestication and breeding in fruit trees. in this study, we aimed to analyse genetic structure and changes in the diversity in sweet cherry prunus avium l.resultsthree subgroups were detected in sweet cherry, with one group of landraces genetically very close to the analysed wild cherry population. a limited number of ssr markers displayed deviations from the frequencies expected under neutrality. after the removal of these markers from the analysis, a very limited bottleneck was detected between wild cherries and sweet cherry landraces, with a much more pronounced bottleneck between sweet cherry landraces and modern sweet cherry varieties. the loss of diversity between wild cherries and sweet cherry landraces at the s-locus was more significant than that for microsatellites. particularly high levels of differentiation were observed for some s-alleles.conclusionsseveral domestication events may have happened in sweet cherry or/and intense gene flow from local wild cherry was probably maintained along the evolutionary history of the species. a marked bottleneck due to breeding was detected, with all markers, in the modern sweet cherry gene pool. the microsatellites did not detect the bottleneck due to domestication in the analysed sample. the vegetative propagation specific to some fruit trees may account for the differences in diversity observed at the s-locus. our study provides insights into domestication events of cherry, however, requires confirmation on a larger sampling scheme for both sweet cherry landraces and wild cherry.
a unified approach for taxonomy-based technology forecasting renewable energy (re) technologies are increasingly viewed as critically important since the noticeable depletion of fossil fuel. knowledge that facilitates forecasting the likely growth and consequences of emergent technologies is essential for well-informed technology management. acquiring and analyzing such knowledge is hampered by the amount of data available in publications. in order to elucidate the advance of technologies, we want to address questions like: “how many scientific articles have been published in solar energy recently?” intelligent search techniques capable of grouping semantically similar concepts are therefore needed, such that e.g. the term ”parabolic trough” is subsumed under solar energy related technologies and hence articles about it should be included in the analysis. the novelty of this work is the deployment of a large, high quality re-taxonomy for comprehensive trend discovery in publications and patents. we report interesting trends of renewables in two case studies: power generation and desalination techniques. while all major renewables — except geothermal-recently boomed in power generation in terms of publication volume, leading to a nearly equibalanced diversification, patents only reflect strong growth for wind and solar. renewables in desalination, in particular reverse osmosis, are mainly solar and wind with a slight upward trend of biofuels in publications, hereas other renewables are still in experimental stage.
involvement of major components from sporothrix schenckii cell wall in the caspase-1 activation, nitric oxide and cytokines production during experimental sporotrichosis production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf) by adherent peritoneal cells from balb/c mice was measured at week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after intravenous inoculation with 10(6) sporothrix schenckii yeasts. as compared with age-matched controls, il-1 and tnf production by adherent peritoneal cells from s. schenckii-infected mice was reduced severely at week 4 and 6 of infection and greater than normal at week 8 and 10. moreover, between week 4 and 6 of infection there was a depression of delayed type hypersensitivity response to a specific whole soluble antigen, and an increase in fungal multiplication in the livers and spleens of infected mice. thus, the deficits of cell-mediated immunity in mice with systemic s. schenckii infection may derive, in part, from impaired amplification of the immune response consequent to abnormal generation of il-1 and tnf.
microrna408 is critical for the hy5-spl7 gene network that mediates the coordinated response to light and copper[c][w] the binding of the sbp domain of crr1 to copper response elements of target promoters in vitro is blocked by cu(ii) or hg(ii), which also deactivate transcription in vivo. mutagenesis of the sbp domain implicates a conserved his residue in interaction with copper ions, suggesting a mechanism for copper sensing. a metallothionein-like domain at the crr1 c terminus is implicated in zinc homeostasis. copper response regulator 1 (crr1), an sbp-domain transcription factor, is a global regulator of nutritional copper signaling in chlamydomonas reinhardtii and activates genes necessary during periods of copper deficiency. we localized chlamydomonas crr1 to the nucleus in mustard (sinapis alba) seedlings, a location consistent with its function as a transcription factor. the zn binding sbp domain of crr1 binds copper ions in vitro. cu(i) can replace zn(ii), but the cu(ii) form is unstable. the dna binding activity is inhibited in vitro by cu(ii) or hg(ii) ions, which also prevent activation of transcription in vivo, but not by co(ii) or ni(ii), which have no effect in vivo. copper inhibition of dna binding is reduced by mutation of a conserved his residue. these results implicate the sbp domain in copper sensing. deletion of a c-terminal metallothionein-like cys-rich domain impacted neither nutritional copper signaling nor the effect of mercuric supplementation, but rendered crr1 insensitive to hypoxia and to nickel supplementation, which normally activate the copper deficiency regulon in wild-type cells. strains carrying the crr1-δcys allele upregulate zrt genes and hyperaccumulate zn(ii), suggesting that the effect of nickel ions may be revealing a role for the c-terminal domain of crr1 in zinc homeostasis in chlamydomonas.
the small-subunit rrna gene sequences of venerids and the phylogeny of bivalvia in the july (1996) issue of journal of molecular evolution, steiner and mu ̈ller (1996) discuss the limitations of 18s rdna sequences to achieve a ‘‘reasonable’’ phylogeny of bivalve mollusks. after a nice introduction to the subject and thorough references to molecular techniques applied to bivalvia, they collect 21 18s rdna sequences published to date—2 polyplacophora, 3 gastropoda, and 16 bivalvia belonging to the filibranchia (4pteriomorphia) and eulamelibranchia ( 4heterodonta)—plus 2 new sequences (both also filibranchia). eight of these sequences, however, were excluded from the main analyses. two more partial sequences were not included: one cephalopoda and one polyplacophora (wheeler et al. 1993). different tree-constructing algorithms, based on parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum-likelihood, as well as other methods, to test the reliability of the clades, such as the prn and spectral analysis were used. the results obtained led them to propose a ‘‘preferred tree (their fig. 9) combining the results from the 18s rdna data and morphological characters compiled by waller (1978, 1990).’’ in their words, this tree ‘‘is not a computer-constructed tree but an evaluation of hypotheses on bivalve phylogeny from the given morphological and molecular trees.’’ moreover ‘‘the failure of neighbor-joining and parsimony to resolve this clade [bivalvia]’’ is probably due to the different substitution rates among species. we have reanalyzed the data set presented by steiner and müller (1996), to which we added 12 more molluscan sequences available via genbank. sequence alignments were generated using clustalw (thompson et al. 1996), with subsequent manual correction based on secondary structure constraints. two alignments were analyzed, one with the whole data set and another in which four ambiguous-alignment zones corresponding to loops were removed. alignments are available at the ftp site porthos.bio.ub.es/users/ftp/pub/teu/18sphylogeny. parsimony analyses were performed with paup 3.1.1 (swofford 1993). analyses were run for both alignments, using unweighted and weighted parsimony at different transition/transversion rates (3 and 5), as well as using transversion parsimony (transitions downweighted to 0). gaps were treated in two ways, as missing data or as a fifth state. three independent data sets were analyzed: the 13 taxa analyzed in the original paper (data set 1), the 21 taxa reported in their table 2 (data set 2), and all molluscan sequences published to date (data set 3). all the analyses run with data sets 2 and 3 rendered bivalvia monophyletic (figs. 1b and c) with an internal unstable topology, varying depending on the analysis condition. the following clades above family level are always monophyletic: pectinidae, arca+ pectinidae, ostreidae, mytilidae, mactridae, and the two represented eulamelibranchia groups ( mya + mactridae). the paraphyletic bivalvia have only been recovered in some cases when data set 1 was used for the analyses (fig. 1a). although the internal topology differs slightly from their fig. 4, the two gastropoda also cluster with the two mactridae, which are the longest branches of the tree. these results clearly indicate that the paraphyletic bivalvia is an artifact, most likely due to the low number of taxa used in the analyses, combined with the long branch attraction effect among the gastropoda and the mactridae. simulations have demonstrated that adding large numbers of additional taxa to phylogenetic analyses may increase the accuracy of the estimated trees, reduce the long branch attraction effect, and, at the same time, reduce the need for computationally complex methods of analysis (hillis 1996). in our case, solely increasing the umber of taxa from 13 to 21 is enough to obtain a robust monophyletic bivalvia clade. from these results we suggest that computational efforts in phylogenetic analysis should focus on analyzing the biggest available data sets instead of performing more costly computational methods (e.g., the prn and spectral analyses) with fewer taxa. the failure of recovering a reliable internal phylogeny j mol evol (1999) 48:256–261
cellular traces of behavioral classical conditioning can be recorded at several specific sites in a simple nervous system in vitro appetitive classical conditioning of the feeding response in the pond snail lymnaea stagnalis. j. neurophysiol. 78: 2351-2362, 1997. an in vitro preparation was developed that allowed electrophysiological analysis of appetitive conditioning of feeding in the model molluscan system, lymnaea. the network generating the feeding motor program (fictive feeding) is well characterized at the cellular level and consists of identified central pattern generator (cpg) interneurons, motor neurons, and modulatory interneurons. activation of a modulatory interneuron, the slow oscillator (so), evokes the three-phase fictive feeding rhythm in the same semi-intact preparations where tactile stimuli can be applied to the lips. by pairing touch as a conditioned stimulus (cs) with stimulation of the so as an unconditioned stimulus (us), we established an effective in vitro paradigm for appetitive conditioning. before training, touch to the lips evoked only brief and weak activity in the feeding interneurons and motor neurons. after 6-10 conditioning trials, there was a significant enhancement in the fictive feeding response to cs alone. this was not seen in controls (cs only, us only, random cs and us) and in preparations where there was no initial brief response to touch before conditioning. direct recordings from the protraction phase n1m interneurons during in vitro conditioning indicated that the enhancement of the fictive feeding is due to an increased activation of these cpg cells by mechanosensory inputs from the lips. we also found that the conditioned response was not due to a facilitated activation of modulatory neurons in the feeding network, such as the so or the cerebral giant cells (cgcs), because the activity of these cells remained unchanged after conditioning.
chromium supplement inhibits skeletal muscle atrophy in hindlimb-suspended mice. skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating response to fasting, disuse, cancer, and other systemic diseases. in atrophying muscles, the ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1 (mafbx), is dramatically induced, and this response is necessary for rapid atrophy. here, we show that in cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the activity of the pi3k/akt pathway decreases, leading to activation of foxo transcription factors and atrogin-1 induction. igf-1 treatment or akt overexpression inhibits foxo and atrogin-1 expression. moreover, constitutively active foxo3 acts on the atrogin-1 promoter to cause atrogin-1 transcription and dramatic atrophy of myotubes and muscle fibers. when foxo activation is blocked by a dominant-negative construct in myotubes or by rnai in mouse muscles in vivo, atrogin-1 induction during starvation and atrophy of myotubes induced by glucocorticoids are prevented. thus, forkhead factor(s) play a critical role in the development of muscle atrophy, and inhibition of foxo factors is an attractive approach to combat muscle wasting.
recoding structural glycoprotein e2 in classical swine fever virus (csfv) produces complete virus attenuation in swine and protects infected animals against disease. abstract exploring the utility of de novo gene synthesis with the aim of designing stably attenuated polioviruses (pv), we followed two strategies to construct pv variants containing synthetic replacements of the capsid coding sequences either by deoptimizing synonymous codon usage (pv-ab) or by maximizing synonymous codon position changes of the existing wild-type (wt) poliovirus codons (pv-sd). despite 934 nucleotide changes in the capsid coding region, pv-sd rna produced virus with wild-type characteristics. in contrast, no viable virus was recovered from pv-ab rna carrying 680 silent mutations, due to a reduction of genome translation and replication below a critical level. after subcloning of smaller portions of the ab capsid coding sequence into the wt background, several viable viruses were obtained with a wide range of phenotypes corresponding to their efficiency of directing genome translation. surprisingly, when inoculated with equal infectious doses (pfu), even the most replication-deficient viruses appeared to be as pathogenic in pv-sensitive cd155tg (transgenic) mice as the pv(m) wild type. however, infection with equal amounts of virus particles revealed a neuroattenuated phenotype over 100-fold. direct analysis indicated a striking reduction of the specific infectivity of pv-ab-type virus particles. due to the distribution effect of many silent mutations over large genome segments, codon-deoptimized viruses should have genetically stable phenotypes, and they may prove suitable as attenuated substrates for the production of poliovirus vaccines.
magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of normal glenoid length and width: an anatomic study. we measured the dimensions of the humeral and glenoid articular surfaces in 140 shoulders that were representative of a given population of patients, and also evaluated several glenohumeral relationships. ninety-six measurements were made in the shoulders of cadavera and forty-four, on magnetic resonance-imaging studies of living patients. eighty-five per cent of the humeral measurements fell within eight fixed combinations of the radius of curvature and the thickness of the humeral head, in two-millimeter increments. the average radius of curvature of the humeral head in the coronal plane was 24 +/- 2.1 millimeters (range, nineteen to twenty-eight millimeters). the average thickness of the humeral head was 19 +/- 2.4 millimeters (range, fifteen to twenty-four millimeters). there was a wide variability in the size of the humeral head and a direct correlation between the differences in size and the heights in both men and women. the humeral articular surface was spherical in the center; however, the peripheral radius was two millimeters less in the axial plane than in the coronal plane. thus, the peripheral contour of the articular surface was elliptical (ratio, 0.92). the radius of curvature of the glenoid, measured in the coronal plane, was an average of 2.3 +/- 0.2 millimeters greater than that of the humeral head. the average dimensions of the glenoid in the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior (lower half) directions were 39 +/- 3.5 millimeters (range, thirty to forty-eight millimeters) and 29 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, twenty-one to thirty-five millimeters). the anterior-posterior dimension of the glenoid was pear-shaped, the lower half being larger than the top half. the ratio of the lower half to the top half was 1:0.80 +/- 0.01. there was a strong linear correlation between the lateral humeral offset and the size of the humeral head (radius of curvature and thickness). the average lateral humeral offset was 56 +/- 5.7 millimeters (range, forty-three to sixty-seven millimeters). the superior most point on the humeral articular surface was an average of 8 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, three to twenty millimeters) cephalad to the top of the greater tuberosity. our data show that reconstruction of the lateral humeral offset is important in optimization of the moment arm of the deltoid and rotator cuff and of the normal tension of the soft tissue after prosthetic reconstruction.
prediction of adolescent outcome in children with disruptive behaviour disorders objective to clarify the developmental risk associated with hyperactive behavior, especially the relationship between hyperactive and conduct problems, in a longitudinal epidemiological design.   method a follow-up study of children who were identified, by parent and teacher ratings in a large community survey of 6- and 7-year-olds, as showing pervasive hyperactivity or conduct problems or the comorbid mixture of both problems or neither problem. they were later investigated, at the age of 16 to 18 years, with detailed interview techniques as well as parental and self-report ratings and cognitive tests.   results hyperactivity was a risk factor for later development, even allowing for the coexistence of conduct problems. its sequelae included a high likelihood of psychiatric diagnosis, persisting hyperactivity, violence and other antisocial behaviors, and social and peer problems.   conclusions the results suggested a developmental pathway through which hyperactivity raised the likelihood of impaired social adjustment, including the development of psychiatric disorders, independently of the existence of conduct problems.
lack of the matricellular protein sparc (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) attenuates liver fibrogenesis in mice the matricellular protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (sparc) modulates cell adhesion, proliferation, matrix deposition, and tissue remodeling. sparc has been shown to regulate the expression of collagen type i and transforming growth factor-beta1 in mesangial cells and to be highly expressed during tubulointerstitial fibrosis in rat angiotensin (ang) ii infusion models. we hypothesized that sparc is a downstream effector of ang ii and that loss of host sparc function provides a protective effect on renal damage and fibrosis associated with ang ii hypertension. our results revealed that cultured primary mesangial cells displayed a concentration-dependent increase in sparc expression in response to ang ii. after a 14-day chronic infusion of ang ii, hypertensive sparc-null mice exhibited significantly attenuated levels of urinary and renal indicators of oxidative stress and inflammation and decreased renal perivascular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis relative to wild-type hypertensive controls. moreover, the observed renal protective changes in sparc-null mice were found to be independent of blood pressure. these results identify sparc as an effector of ang ii signaling and suggest an important role for sparc in mediating ang ii-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis.
oxytocin selectively facilitates learning with social feedback and increases activity and functional connectivity in emotional memory and reward processing regions the neuropeptide oxytocin is involved in the development and maintenance of attachment behaviours in humans and other species. little is known, however, about how it affects judgements of unfamiliar others. in a double-blind placebo-controlled study we investigated the effect of a single intranasal dose of oxytocin on judgements of facial trustworthiness and attractiveness. we found that oxytocin administration increased ratings of trustworthiness and attractiveness of male and female targets in raters of both sexes relative to control ratings, suggesting that higher levels of this neuropeptide may enhance affiliative behaviour towards unfamiliar others. our results provide evidence in support of a general facilitative role of oxytocin in promoting positive trait judgements.
link between motor competence and health related fitness in children and adolescents children with low motor competence (lmc) are less able to participate fully in many sports and recreational activities typically enjoyed by their well-coordinated peers. poor fitness outcomes have been reported for these children, although previous studies have not tracked these outcomes over time. in this study, 19 children (8 girls and 11 boys) with lmc aged between 5 and 7years were matched by age and gender with 19 children with high motor competence (hmc). six fitness (body composition and cardiovascular endurance) and motor skill (sprint run, standing broad jump and balance) measures were repeated for each group once a year for five years. for each year of the study, the lmc groups performed less well on all measures than the hmc groups. changes over time were significantly different between groups for cardiovascular endurance, 50-m run and balance, but not for body composition, overhand throw or standing broad jump. between the two groups, performances were significantly different for all measures, except body composition. these findings confirm the impact of lmc on fitness measures and skill performances over time.
imaging attentional modulation of pain in the periaqueductal gray in humans electrical brain stimulation is effective in controlling certain intractable chronic pain syndromes in humans, but the specific target site(s) for stimulation producing a maximal analgesic effect is (are) not well defined. this prospective study correlates the clinical results of chronic stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (pag) and periventricular gray (pvg) matter in humans with the anatomic site of electrode placement as determined at autopsy, and documents the histologic reactions to electrode implantation and electrical stimulation of the area. seven patients underwent electrode implantation to control their chronic pain; two had electrodes implanted bilaterally. all patients obtained complete analgesia with stimulation, although 3 subsequently found the stimulation to have diminished efficacy. the opiate antagonist naloxone reversed the analgesia in the 4 patients so tested. all 7 patients later died of causes unrelated to electrode implantation or stimulation. postmortem analysis showed that, for 6 of the 9 electrodes implanted, the electrode tip was located in the ventrolateral pag at the level of the posterior commissure; the other 3 electrodes were found in the white matter adjacent to the pag. no evidence of gliosis or parenchymal reaction was observed along the tracts and tips of the electrodes. the results indicate that the ventrolateral pag and pvg matter at the level of the posterior commissure is the optimal site for therapeutic electrical brain stimulation for opiate-responsive pain in humans.
methylated-rich regions and tandem repeat arrays along the chromosome complement of colpodium versicolor (stev.) schmalh summary.haplopappus gracilis (nutt.) gray, one of the five known higher plants with a chromosome number of 2n = 4, was studied from a cytological point of view. the chromosome complement of this species was characterized by means of automated karyotype analysis. moreover, the dna methylation pattern and fluorochrome banding were determined and compared with cytological data present in the literature. dna methylation distribution along metaphase chromosomes involved all chromosome territories evidenced by c-banding. other methylated bands correlated positively with aceto-orcein-positive heterochromatic portions and/or with late replicating bands and/or fluorochrome bands. some methylated bands showed differences between homologous chromosomes. these bands belonged partly to certain heterochromatic domains and partly to intercalary sites not defined by other standard banding techniques. differences between the homologues were also indicated by our dna content data obtained after dnase i digestion.
effects of visual biofeedback therapy on postural balance of stroke patients objective to examine the physiologic and functional recovery of standing balance and health-related quality of life (hrqol) in people after mild and moderate stroke.   design inception cohort study with evaluations at 1 month and 3 months poststroke.   setting laboratory.   participants twenty-nine volunteers who had sustained a stroke. subjects were categorized into mild and moderate groups.   interventions not applicable.   main outcome measures functional balance was assessed (clinical outcome variables scale [covs]) and physiologic measures (electromyography, postural sway) were taken when subjects stood quietly on a force platform and when they performed a rapid unilateral arm-raise perturbation. the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey (sf-36) was administered to evaluate hrqol.   results subjects in the mild group were approaching maximal scores on the covs (87.7+/-4.1/91) at 3 months poststroke, yet had significant impairment in paretic muscle activation patterns when compared with healthy subjects. subjects in the moderate group had increased paretic muscle activation over the 2 months, accompanied by significant increases of 10.7+/-5.9 points on the covs. for both groups, there was significantly less postural sway on the paretic than the nonparetic leg and significant improvements in the sf-36 (physical component) over time.   conclusions subjects recovering from a stroke showed a significant improvement in physical hrqol and functional and physiologic balance, yet the physiologic balance recovery was not complete even in the mild group.
effects of exercise on muscle metabolites and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in ovariectomized rats. sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+ uptake and ca2+-mg2+-atpase activity were examined in muscle homogenates and the purified sr fraction of the superficial and deep fibers of the gastrocnemius and vastus muscles of the rat after treadmill runs of 20 or 45 min or to exhaustion (avg time to exhaustion 140 min). vesicle intactness and cross-contamination of isolated sr were estimated using a calcium ionophore and mitochondrial and sarcolemmal marker enzymes, respectively. present findings confirm previously reported fiber-type specific depression in the initial rate and maximum capacity of ca2+ uptake and altered atpase activity after exercise. depression of the ca2+-stimulated atpase activity of the enzyme was evident after greater than or equal to 20 min of exercise in sr isolated from the deep fibers of these muscles. the lowered atpase activity was followed by a depression in the initial rate of ca2+ uptake in both muscle homogenates and isolated sr fractions after greater than or equal to 45 min of exercise. maximum ca2+ uptake capacity was lower in isolated sr only after exhaustive exercise. ca2+ uptake and ca2+-sensitive atpase activity were not affected at any duration of exercise in sr isolated from superficial fibers of these muscles; however, the mg2+-dependent atpase activity was increased after 45 min and exhaustive exercise bouts. the alterations in sr function could not be attributed to disrupted vesicles or differential contamination in the sr from exercise groups and were reinforced by similar changes in ca2+ uptake in crude muscle homogenates.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
autoimmune hemolytic anemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: analysis of 533 adult patients who underwent transplantation at king's college hospital. we reviewed the medical records of 293 patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplants at the hammersmith hospital between 1989 and 1994. there was clinical evidence of an autoimmune reaction against red cells in nine patients. seven of these patients had significant haemolysis; the other two had red cell auto-agglutination. haemolysis was resistant to treatment in three cases. six of the nine patients had monoclonal ig bands identified within 1 year of transplant. the autoimmune reaction could be classified broadly into two types: an early onset type (n = 4) beginning 2 to 8 months post-transplant associated with a cold antibody, and a late onset type (n = 5) beginning 6 to 18 months post-transplant associated with warm antibodies. the predominant antibody in the two categories described may reflect the kinetics of immune reconstitution post-transplant, since serum igm levels typically return to normal 2 to 6 months post-transplant, while igg levels may not reach normal levels until 12–18 months post-transplant. we speculate that unbalanced reconstitution of b and t cell lymphopoiesis post-transplant may favour emergence of oligoclonal proliferation and that some of the resulting antibodies may have activity against red cells.
lymphatic involvement in the disappearance of steroidogenic cells from the corpus luteum during luteolysis abstract corpora lutea removed at various times during the estrous cycle were studied after no treatment, treatment with oxytocin, oxytocin and hcg, oxytocin and bovine lh, and with hcg alone. these studies supported a hypothesis that luteal cells are derived from both granulosa and theca interna layers of the follicle. the granulosa-derived luteal cells develop into functioning luteal cells by about day 4 of the estrous cycle, after which they undergo no further divisions. therefore, granulosa-derived cells have limited potential. however, the smaller luteal cells derived from the theca interna respond to plasma luteotropin, multiply and grow into large luteal cells. these are mainly responsible for growth of the corpus luteum following day 4. there was luteinization of the theca interna and granulosa layers of the follicles shortly before ovulation and in anovulatory (cystic) follicles. the collapse of the follicle and growth of the corpus luteum were described, with special emphasis on the patterns of mitotic activity before and after stimulation with exogenous luteotropin and on progesterone concentrations and contents. growth and degeneration of a luteal cell were described.
sortilin expression is essential for pro-nerve growth factor-induced apoptosis of rat vascular smooth muscle cells neurotrophins are growth factors that promote cell survival, differentiation, and cell death. they are synthesized as proforms that can be cleaved intracellularly to release mature, secreted ligands. although proneurotrophins have been considered inactive precursors, we show here that the proforms of nerve growth factor (ngf) and the proforms of brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) are secreted and cleaved extracellularly by the serine protease plasmin and by selective matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). prongf is a high-affinity ligand for p75ntr with high affinity and induced p75ntr-dependent apoptosis in cultured neurons with minimal activation of trka-mediated differentiation or survival. the biological action of neurotrophins is thus regulated by proteolytic cleavage, with proforms preferentially activating p75ntr to mediate apoptosis and mature forms activating trk receptors to promote survival.
sf-1 expression in the hypothalamus is required for beneficial metabolic effects of exercise phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (pi3k) signaling in the hypothalamus has been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, but the critical brain sites where this intracellular signal integrates various metabolic cues to regulate food intake and energy expenditure are unknown. here, we show that mice with reduced pi3k activity in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmh) are more sensitive to high-fat diet-induced obesity due to reduced energy expenditure. in addition, inhibition of pi3k in the vmh impaired the ability to alter energy expenditure in response to acute high-fat diet feeding and food deprivation. furthermore, the acute anorexigenic effects induced by exogenous leptin were blunted in the mutant mice. collectively, our results indicate that pi3k activity in vmh neurons plays a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of energy expenditure.
fas activation increases neural progenitor cell survival the potential of pluripotent embryonic stem (es) cells to develop into functional cells or tissue provides an opportunity in the development of new therapies for many diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. the survival of implanted cells usually requires systemic immunosuppression, however, which severely compromises the host immune system, leading to complications in clinical transplantation. an optimal therapy would therefore be the induction of specific tolerance to the donor cells, while otherwise preserving functional immune responses. fas ligand (fasl) is expressed in activated lymphocytes as well as cells in “immune‐privileged” sites including the central nervous system. its receptor, fas, is expressed on various immune‐reactive cell types, such as activated natural killer and t cells, monocytes, and polymorphic mononucleocytes, which can undergo apoptosis upon interaction with fasl. to render transplanted cells tolerant to host cellular immune responses, we genetically engineered mouse es cells to express rat fasl (rfasl). the rfasl‐expressing es cells were analyzed for survival during in vitro neurodifferentiation and after transplantation to the rat brain without further immunosuppression. although control transfected hek‐293t cells expressed functional rfasl, immature and differentiated mouse es cells did not express the recombinant rfasl surface protein. furthermore, there was no evidence for functional endogenous fas and fasl expression on either es cells or on neural cells after in vitro differentiation. moreover, implanted rfasl‐engineered es cells did not survive in the rat brains in the absence of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine a. our results indicate that immature and differentiated mouse es cells do not express a functional fas/fasl system.
sex determination using humeral dimensions in a sample from kwazulu-natal: an osteometric study determination of sex from the skeleton is vital to medicolegal investigations. there is no longer any question that populations differ in size and proportions and these differences affect the metric assessment of sex. the extent of variation in sexual dimorphism among asian mongoloids within and between regions has not been quantified by discriminant function analysis, nor have standards for most groups been introduced for the humerus. therefore, the purpose of this research is to establish metric standards for sex determination from the humerus of chinese, japanese and thais, as well as to compare size and sexual dimorphism in these asian mongoloid populations. the database for this study consisted of documented skeletal samples from china (n = 87), japan (n = 90), and thailand (n = 104). six standard dimensions, including maximum length, vertical head diameter, minimum midshaft diameter, maximum midshaft diameter, midshaft circumference, and epicondylar breadth were taken and subjected to stepwise and direct discriminant function analysis. of dimensions selected by the stepwise function, vertical head diameter and epicondylar breadth were the only elements common to all three groups. overall, mean accuracies were highest using formulae produced by the stepwise procedure and ranged from 86.8% in the chinese to 92.4% in the japanese to 97.1% in the thais. group comparisons also revealed that while the chinese had the largest measurements, they were the least dimorphic. the reverse was true for the thais and the japanese were intermediate on both counts. in cross validation tests, classification accuracy decreased in all cases where a formula from one group was applied to another. it was therefore concluded even though all individuals were asian mongoloids, these regionally diverse populations exhibited significant metric differences that affect sex determination from the skeleton. these findings confirm those of previous studies that there is a need for group specific metric standards of assessment.
scalable transcriptional analysis routine—multiplexed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction platform for gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics we describe a multiplex nucleic acid assay that identifies and determines the abundance of four different pathogenic retroviruses (hiv-1, hiv-2, and human t-lymphotrophic virus types i and ii). retroviral dna sequences are amplified in a single, sealed tube by simultaneous pcr assays, and the resulting amplicons are detected in real time by the hybridization of four differently colored, amplicon-specific molecular beacons. the color of the fluorescence generated in the course of amplification identifies which retroviruses are present, and the number of thermal cycles required for the intensity of each color to rise significantly above background provides an accurate measure of the number of copies of each retroviral sequence that were present originally in the sample. fewer than 10 retroviral genomes can be detected. moreover, 10 copies of a rare retrovirus can be detected in the presence of 100, 000 copies of an abundant retrovirus. ninety-six samples can be analyzed in 3 hr on a single plate, and the use of a closed-tube format eliminates crossover contamination. utilizing previously well characterized clinical samples, we demonstrate that each of the pathogenic retroviruses can be identified correctly and no false positives occur. this assay enables the rapid and reliable screening of donated blood and transplantable tissues.
intradermal cytosine-phosphate-guanosine treatment reduces lung inflammation but induces ifn-γ-mediated airway hyperreactivity in a murine model of natural rubber latex allergy. allergic asthma is a complex syndrome characterized by airway obstruction, airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (ahr). using a mouse model of allergen-induced ahr, we previously demonstrated that cd8-deficient mice develop significantly lower ahr, eosinophilic inflammation and interleukin (il)-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with wild-type mice. these responses were restored by adoptive transfer of antigen-primed cd8+ t cells. previously, two distinct populations of antigen-experienced cd8+ t cells, termed effector (teff) and central memory (tcm) cells, have been described. after adoptive transfer into cd8-deficient mice, teff, but not tcm, cells restored ahr, eosinophilic inflammation and il-13 levels. teff, but not tcm, cells accumulated in the lungs, and intracellular cytokine staining showed that the transferred teff cells were a source of il-13. these data suggest an important role for effector cd8+ t cells in the development of ahr and airway inflammation, which may be associated with their tc2-type cytokine production and their capacity to migrate into the lung.
the effect of in vitro γ-irradiation on mitogenic responsiveness of murine lymphocytes abstract.human lymphocyte subpopulations differ in their cellular responses to ionizing radiation. to shed light on the molecular basis of this effect, we characterized the transcriptional response to 1 gy x-rays of cd4+ t lymphocytes. of 18,433 genes tested, 102 were modulated more than 1.5-fold. the majority of the strongly activated genes were p53 targets involved in dna repair and apoptosis. the expression of three of these genes was further tested by quantitative rt-pcr in lymphocyte subpopulations [cd4+ and cd8+ t, cd19+ b, cd56+ natural killer cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls)] from ten adult donors. in contrast to ddb2, tnfrsf10b and bax were differentially modulated among the subpopulations and the pbls, being more activated in irradiated cd19+ b and cd8+ t lymphocytes. the level of bax activation in the various subpopulations correlated with the sensitivity of the cells to radiation, suggesting its possible role in the differential radiosensitivity of hematopoietic cell subsets.
garlic (allium sativum) supplementation: influence on egg production, quality, and yolk cholesterol level in layer hens a total of 2123 eggs obtained from brown leghorn hens (unselected since 1965, isa brown, commercial brown egg layer) and babcock hens (commercial white egg layer) at 32, 50, and 68 wk of age were used to investigate relationships among measures of albumen quality and a functional property of albumen. the eggs were sampled fresh and after storage for 5 and 10 d. at sampling, eggs were weighed and broken, and albumen height, ph, and volume after whipping for 80 s were measured. also, yolks were weighed, dried shells were weighed, and albumen weight was determined by difference. egg weight and the weights of the 3 principal components of the egg all increased with increasing age of the hen, with yolk weights increasing proportionately more. with storage, egg and albumen weights decreased, whereas yolk weight increased. eggs from brown leghorn hens were smallest but had proportionately the largest yolks. albumen height decreased with time in storage, and albumen ph and whipping volume increased. differences between lines suggested that selection has changed the proportion of the yolk, albumen, and shell and has increased albumen height. albumen height and whipping volume were negatively correlated, and differences between lines suggest that selection could have decreased the foaming ability of albumen, a principal reason for including eggs in many processed food products.
the effect of exercise intensity on endothelial function in physically inactive lean and obese adults the transient impairment of endothelial function following a high-fat meal is well established. brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (fmd) decreases between 2 and 6 h post ingestion. whether this impairment can be reduced with acute aerobic exercise has not been investigated. the purpose of this study was to investigate if a single sustained aerobic exercise session can counteract the postprandial attenuation in brachial artery fmd associated with the ingestion of a high-fat meal. eight apparently healthy adults (five men, three women), age 25.5 ± 0.8 years, performed three treatment conditions in a counter-balanced design: (1) low-fat meal alone (lfm), (2) high-fat meal alone (hfm), and (3) one session of aerobic exercise presented 2 h after ingesting a high-fat meal (hfm-ex). the examination of brachial artery fmd was performed at baseline and 4 h following the ingestion of the meal for each treatment condition. a 3 × 2 (treatment × time) repeated measures anova exhibited a significant interaction (p = 0.019). preprandial fmds were similar (p = 0.863) among all three treatment conditions. the fmds following the lfm (7.18 ± 1.31%) and hfm-ex (8.72 ± 0.94%) were significantly higher (p = 0.001) than the fmd following the hfm (4.29 ± 1.64%). fmd was significantly elevated above preprandial values following the hfm-ex (5.61 ± 1.54 to 8.72 ± 0.94%, p = 0.005) but was unchanged following the lfm (6.17 ± 0.94 to 7.18 ± 1.31%, p = 0.317) and the hfm (5.73 ± 1.23 to 4.29 ± 1.64%, p = 0.160). these findings suggest that a single aerobic exercise session cannot only counteract the postprandial endothelial dysfunction induced by the ingestion of a high-fat meal, but also increase brachial artery fmd in apparently healthy adults.
identification and characterization of an avian β-defensin orthologue, avian β-defensin 9, from quails abstractantimicrobial peptides (amps) are essential components of innate immunity in a range of species from drosophila to humans and are generally thought to act by disrupting the membrane integrity of microbes. in order to discover novel amps in the chicken, we have implemented a bioinformatic approach that involves the clustering of more than 420,000 chicken expressed sequence tags (ests). similarity searching of proteins—predicted to be encoded by these est clusters—for homology to known amps has resulted in the in silico identification of full-length sequences for seven novel gallinacins (gal-4 to gal-10), a novel cathelicidin and a novel liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (leap-2) in the chicken. differential gene expression of these novel genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken tissues. an evolutionary analysis of the gallinacin family has detected sites—primarily in the mature amp—that are under positive selection in these molecules. the functional implications of these results are discussed.
seed-mediated gene flow promotes genetic diversity of weedy rice within populations: implications for weed management apart from their significance in genetic conservation, barley landraces are still favoured by local farmers in low-input farming systems. they often perform more predictably under adverse conditions than modern cultivars due to local adaptation. increased seed exchange between farmers may put adaptation of local populations of barley landraces at risk. isozyme markers were used to investigate differentiation and infer gene flow between local populations of barley landrace arabi aswad in northern syria. inferred gene flow decreased exponentially with geographic distance and may imply that seed exchange between farmers is limited to a regional scale and diminishes over longer distance. gene flow seems to be a suitable index for estimating seed exchange in highly inbreeding crop species such as barley. in the future, improved mobility of farmers and extension work may facilitate seed exchange over longer distances, and consequently jeopardise preservation of locally adapted landraces in barley.
brachypodium cell wall mutant with enhanced saccharification potential despite increased lignin content brachypodium distachyon (brachypodium) has been proposed as a model for grasses, but there is limited knowledge regarding its lignins and no data on lignin-related mutants. the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (cad) genes involved in lignification are promising targets to improve the cellulose-to-ethanol conversion process. down-regulation of cad often induces a reddish coloration of lignified tissues. based on this observation, we screened a chemically induced population of brachypodium mutants (bd21-3 background) for red culm coloration. we identified two mutants (bd4179 and bd7591), with mutations in the bdcad1 gene. the mature stems of these mutants displayed reduced cad activity and lower lignin content. their lignins were enriched in 8-o-4- and 4-o-5-coupled sinapaldehyde units, as well as resistant inter-unit bonds and free phenolic groups. by contrast, there was no increase in coniferaldehyde end groups. moreover, the amount of sinapic acid ester-linked to cell walls was measured for the first time in a lignin-related cad grass mutant. functional complementation of the bd4179 mutant with the wild-type bdcad1 allele restored the wild-type phenotype and lignification. saccharification assays revealed that bd4179 and bd7591 lines were more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than wild-type plants. here, we have demonstrated that bdcad1 is involved in lignification of brachypodium. we have shown that a single nucleotide change in bdcad1 reduces the lignin level and increases the degree of branching of lignins through incorporation of sinapaldehyde. these changes make saccharification of cells walls pre-treated with alkaline easier without compromising plant growth.
quantification of plaque lipids in the aortic root of apoe-deficient mice by 3d dixon magnetic resonance imaging in an ex vivo model specific mri techniques have been used to determine the dimensional and compositional properties of atherosclerotic lesions in carotid endarterectomy tissues. a quantitative comparison of areas of specific features in typical tissue segments was performed using mr images and histologic images. the mean difference for the measurements by the two methods was 4.5% for the total vessel, 5.3% for the internal carotid artery lumen, and 5.0% for the external carotid lumen. for other less abundant components, the mean difference was 14.2%. for direct characterization, individual tissue components were isolated by microdissection and their t1 and t2 relaxation times measured. highly calcified areas typically had rather short t1 (452-837 ms) and short t2 (10.4-18.4 ms). in contrast, regions enriched in lipid had much longer t1 (1,380-1,480 ms) and longer t2 (35.3-49.0 ms). other components such as thrombus had intermediate t1 (1,180 ms) and short t2 (15.4 ms). t2 parametric imaging was used as a complementary approach for segmentation and quantitation of tissue components. in fresh tissue, several different components exhibited different t2 ranges: calcified/solid lipid (13-18 ms). cellular/ecm (9-30 ms), fluid lipid (35-40 ms): fibrous (50-60 ms). these results demonstrate the utility of mri for identifying and quantifying specific components of atherosclerotic plaque ex vivo, and suggest its value for these measurements in vivo as well.
enriched endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria interactions result in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in oocytes from obese mice proper function of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and mitochondria is crucial for cellular homeostasis, and dysfunction at either site has been linked to pathophysiological states, including metabolic diseases. although the er and mitochondria play distinct cellular roles, these organelles also form physical interactions with each other at sites defined as mitochondria-associated er membranes (mams), which are essential for calcium, lipid and metabolite exchange. here we show that in the liver, obesity leads to a marked reorganization of mams resulting in mitochondrial calcium overload, compromised mitochondrial oxidative capacity and augmented oxidative stress. experimental induction of er-mitochondria interactions results in oxidative stress and impaired metabolic homeostasis, whereas downregulation of pacs-2 or ip3r1, proteins important for er-mitochondria tethering or calcium transport, respectively, improves mitochondrial oxidative capacity and glucose metabolism in obese animals. these findings establish excessive er-mitochondrial coupling as an essential component of organelle dysfunction in obesity that may contribute to the development of metabolic pathologies such as insulin resistance and diabetes.
the insulin–melatonin antagonism: studies in the lew.1ar1-iddm rat (an animal model of human type 1 diabetes mellitus) experiments were conducted in male rats to study the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on circadian rhythms of (a) plasma corticosterone concentrations; (b) motor activity; and (c) metabolic patterns. animals were entrained to ld cycles of 12:12 hr and fed ad libitum. a daily rhythm of plasma corticosterone concentrations was found in controls animals with peak levels at 2400 hr and low values during the remaining hours. this rhythm was statistically confirmed by the cosinor method and had an amplitude of 3.37 micrograms/100 ml and the acrophase at 100 hr. a loss of the normal circadian variation was observed in diabetic animals, with a nadir at the onset of light period and high values throughout the remaining hours; cosinor analysis of these data showed no circadian rhythm, delete and a higher mean level than controls. as expected, normal rats presented most of their motor activity during the dark period with 80% of total daily activity; the cosinor method demonstrated a circadian rhythm with an amplitude of 60% of the mean level and the acrophase at 0852 hr. both diabetic and control rats showed a similar activity during the light phase, but diabetic animals had less activity than controls during the night and their percentage of total daily activity was similar in both phases of the ld cycle (50% for each one). with the cosinor method we were able to show the persistence of a circadian rhythm in the motor activity of diabetic rats, but with a mesor and amplitude lower than in controls (amplitude rested at 60% of the mean level) and its acrophase advanced to 0148 hr.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
life after prostate cancer treatment: a mixed methods study of the experiences of men with sexual dysfunction and their partners the purpose of this study was to illuminate the experience of living after radical prostatectomy (rp) for localized prostate cancer (lpc). ten men were interviewed after rp. the interview text was qualitatively analyzed using the content analysis. the men suffered from worry, anxiety, and distress, and longed for life as they had lived it before the diagnosis. changes in bodily functions after rp include urine incontinence (ui) and/or erectile dysfunction (ed) making the patient feel like a changed man with a lost sex life, with changes in his intimate relations with his wife, and with lowered self-esteem. most men choose to cope on their own. coping strategies in our study population included finding new areas of interest and a new focus in the present. in the present study, living after rp meant striving to gain control over, and become reconciled with, the new life situation as a changed man living with an altered self.
importance of the ncp7-like domain in the recognition of pre-let-7g by the pluripotency factor lin28 several recent studies have provided evidence that lin28, a cytoplasmic rna-binding protein, inhibits the biogenesis of members of the let-7 microrna family at the dicer step in both mammals and caenorhabditis elegans. however, the precise mechanism of inhibition is still poorly understood. here we report on an in vitro study, which combined rnase footprinting, gel shift binding assays, and processing assays, to investigate the molecular basis and function of the interaction between the native let-7g precursor (pre-let-7g) and lin28. we have mapped the structure of pre-let-7g and identified some regions of the terminal loop of pre-let-7g that physically interact with lin28. we have also identified a conformational change upon lin28 binding that results in the unwinding of an otherwise double-stranded region at the dicer processing site of pre-let-7g. furthermore, we showed that a mutant pre-let-7g that displays an open upper stem inhibited pre-let-7g dicer processing to the same extent as lin28. the data support a mechanism by which lin28 can directly inhibit let-7g biogenesis at the dicer processing step.
neural correlates of control operations in inverse priming with relevant and irrelevant masks masked stimuli (primes) can affect the preparation of a motor response to subsequently presented target stimuli. reactions to the target can be facilitated (straight priming) or inhibited (inverse priming) when preceded by a compatible prime (calling for the same response) and also when preceded by an incompatible prime. several hypotheses are currently under debate. these are the self-inhibition (si) hypothesis, the object-updating (ou) hypothesis, and mask-triggered inhibition (mti) hypothesis. all assume that the initial activation of the motor response is elicited by the prime according to its identity. this activation inevitably leads to straight priming in some cases and the mechanisms involved are undisputed. the hypotheses differ, however, as to why inverse priming occurs. the self-inhibition (si) hypothesis assumes that the motor activation elicited by a prime is automatically followed by an inhibition phase, leading to inverse priming if three conditions are fulfilled: perceptual evidence for the prime has to be sufficiently strong, it has to be immediately removed by the mask, and the delay between the prime and target has to be long enough for inhibition to become effective. the object-updating (ou) hypothesis assumes that inverse priming is triggered by the mask, provided that it contains features calling for the alternative response (i.e. the one contrasting with the response induced by the prime). the mti hypothesis assumes that the inhibitory phase is triggered by each successive stimulus which does not support the perceptual hypothesis provided by the prime. based mostly on our own experiments, we argue that (1) attempts to manipulate the three factors required by the si hypothesis imply changes of other variables and that (2) indeed, other variables seem to affect priming: prime-mask perceptual interaction and temporal position of the mask. these observations are in favor of the mti hypothesis. a limiting factor for all three hypotheses is that inverse priming is larger for arrows than for other shapes, making it doubtful as to what extent the majority of studies on inverse priming, due to their use of arrows, can be generalized to other stimuli.
psychiatric comorbidity in cocaine users treated in therapeutic community: substance-induced versus independent disorders the authors explored the relationship between social phobia and cocaine dependence in 158 individuals entering a pharmacologic treatment trial for cocaine dependence. twenty-two patients met dsm-iii-r criteria for social phobia. the social phobia group was compared with 22 age- and sex-matched cocaine-dependent control subjects. those with social phobia and cocaine dependence were more likely to have additional psychiatric diagnoses and greater symptom severity, more likely to be polysubstance users, and more likely to have developed alcohol dependence at an early age. the authors discuss treatment implications of these data.
a comparative in vitro efficacy of conventional rotatory and chemomechanical caries removal: influence on cariogenic flora, microhardness, and residual composition objectives the usage of minimally invasive procedures and attention to patient comfort are of great importance, especially for dental treatment in small children. this has led to the development of chemomechanical methods for caries removal. the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of chemomechanical caries removal with that of conventional excavation in reducing the count of the cariogenic flora.   design and setting subjects for this study were chosen from children admitted to dental clinic for restorative procedures under general anaesthesia.   samples and methods twenty-one children (mean age 43.5 +/- 12.0 months) with early childhood caries were included in this study. two primary teeth with comparable degrees of carious destruction were chosen in each child (n = 42) for caries removal with carisolv' or by means of rotary instruments. samples from carious dentine were taken with a sterile scraping instrument, then all softened dentine was removed and a second sample was taken. all samples (n = 84) were serially diluted and plated on two different nutrient agar plates.   results after 24 h of incubation, colony forming units were determined for total bacterial counts and lactobacilli. twelve per cent of the samples from carious dentine contained more than 10(6) bacteria, 23.8% contained more than 10(5) lactobacilli. both methods of caries removal produced a statistically significant reduction in the bacterial counts (p = 0.0001). in at least 90.5% of the samples taken after the removal, the total bacterial count was below 10(2), and in 95.2% lactobacilli fell below 10(2).   conclusion these results indicate that the efficacy of chemomechanical removal of carious dentine in children by means of carisolv' is comparable to the results obtained by conventional methods, and thus might serve as a suitable alternative.
association between the g.296596g > a genetic variant of reln gene and susceptibility to autism in a chinese han population autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with severe cognitive and communication disabilities, that has a strong genetic predisposition.1 reelin, a protein involved in neuronal migration during development, is encoded by a gene located on 7q22,2 within the candidate region on 7q showing increased allele sharing in previous genome scans.3–8 a case/control and family-based association study recently reported a positive association between a trinucleotide repeat polymorphism (ggc) located in the 5′ untranslated region (utr) of the reelin gene and autism.9 we performed a transmission disequilibrium test (tdt) analysis of the 5′utr polymorphism in 167 families including 218 affected subjects (117 trios and 50 affected sib pairs) and found no evidence of linkage/association. our results do not support previous findings and suggest that this ggc polymorphism of the reelin gene is unlikely to be a major susceptibility factor in autism and/or genetic heterogeneity.
sharing costs for better selfish network design we investigate cost-sharing algorithms for multicast transmission. economic considerations point to two distinct mechanisms, marginal cost and shapley value, as the two solutions most appropriate in this context. we prove that the former has a natural algorithm that uses only two messages per link of the multicast tree, while we give evidence that the latter requires a quadratic total number of messages. we also show that the welfare value achieved by an optimal multicast tree is np-hard to approximate within any constant factor, even for bounded-degree networks. the lower-bound proof for the shapley value uses a novel algebraic technique for bounding from below the number of messages exchanged in a distributed computation; this technique may prove useful in other contexts as well.
measuring symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome: development of a framework for clinical trials irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) involves a broad range of physiological and psychological alterations that may affect brain–gut dysregulation, gut function, visceral perception, and mucosal integrity and function. despite advances in our understanding of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the role of effectors and transmitters in the brain–gut axis, a reliable biologic marker of ibs has yet to be identified (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). ibs diagnosis and status depend entirely on an assessment of ibs signs and symptoms. this has made development of optimal end points and study design for evaluation of efficacy of ibs drugs a challenge. this article addresses three main topics: the evolution of primary end points for ibs clinical trials; a potential path forward for ibs end points in new clinical trials; and recommendations for the future development of patient-reported outcome (pro) instruments for use in ibs clinical trials.
differential expression of foxo1 during development and myoblast differentiation of qinchuan cattle and its association analysis with growth traits forkhead box (fox) proteins play critical roles in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation, immunity and aging of cells. most studies on fox proteins are limited to cultured cells and rodent. the aim of the current study is to detect by immunohistrochemistry whether foxo1, foxo3a and foxo4 proteins are localized in the stomach and intestine of the pig. the results showed that foxo4 exists in the mucosa in all parts of the stomach and intestine; foxo3a exists mainly in the lamina propria and muscularis of some parts. however, foxo1 is not detectable in all parts of the stomach and intestine. collectively, the results of the present study indicate that there exists a distinct expression pattern of fox proteins, and that foxo4 is a primary forkhead transcriptional factor localized in the gastrointestinal tracts of the pig.
mercury concentrations in the tissues of bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) and striped dolphins (stenella coeruloalba) stranded on the croatian adriatic coast tissue distributions of metals (mercury, lead, cadmium, zinc, copper, iron, manganese) were determined in six specimens of striped dolphins (stenella coeruleoalba, meyen) stranded on the apulian coasts (southern italy) between february and june 1987. methyl mercury and selenium were also determined in the liver samples. the liver accumulated the highest concentrations of metals, except for cadmium and chromium. metal levels were higher than those found in dolphins living in the atlantic, but lower than those recorded in the same species from the french mediterranean coasts. necroscopic surveys found that all specimens were affected by haemorrhagic gastritis, but the cause was not clear. while it was not possible to related the death of dolphins to a specific cause, or to contaminants, the accumulation of metals is likely to contribute to the health of the organism and represents a risk factor for dolphins.
matrix metalloproteinase gene polymorphisms in patients with coronary artery disease matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the pathology underlying the majority of coronary artery disease. we previously identified several polymorphisms in the gene encoding mmp-9. in this study we tested the hypothesis that variation in the matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene influences the development of atherosclerosis. three common polymorphisms, i.e. −1562c>t, r+279q and +6c>t, were analysed in 1510 white subjects undergoing coronary angiography. analyses of individual polymorphisms showed that the frequencies of the c/t and t/t genotypes of the −1562c>t polymorphism were significantly higher in patients with coronary stenosis than in those with a normal angiogram. logistic regression analyses indicated that individuals carrying the −1562t allele had an approx. 1.5-fold higher risk of developing coronary stenosis (or 1.49, 95% ci 1.039–2.144), which was equivalent to an over 30% reduction in risk of coronary stenosis in individuals not carrying this allele (or 0.670, 95% ci 0.467–0.963). the three polymorphisms studied were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. haplotype analyses showed that the c-g-c haplotype (−1562c, +279q and +6c) was associated with a protective effect against atherosclerosis. individuals carrying this haplotype were at reduced risk of developing coronary stenosis (or 0.695, 95% ci 0.530.92). furthermore, the c-g-c haplotype was associated with less severe coronary atherosclerosis, i.e. carriers of this haplotype were at a lower risk of having coronary stenosis in more than one coronary artery (or 0.796, 95% ci 0.640.99). these data, together with the previous finding that the −1562t allele has a higher transcriptional activity than the −1562c allele, support the notion that genetic variation with an effect on mmp-9 expression influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
efficacy and interindividual variability in motor-cortex plasticity following anodal tdcs and paired-associative stimulation objective to induce prolonged motor cortical excitability reductions by transcranial direct current stimulation in the human.   methods cathodal direct current stimulation was applied transcranially to the hand area of the human primary motor cortex from 5 to 9 min in separate sessions in twelve healthy subjects. cortico-spinal excitability was tested by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. transcranial electrical stimulation and h-reflexes were used to learn about the origin of the excitability changes. neurone specific enolase was measured before and after the stimulation to prove the safety of the stimulation protocol.   results five and 7 min direct current stimulation resulted in motor cortical excitability reductions, which lasted for minutes after the end of stimulation, 9 min stimulation induced after-effects for up to an hour after the end of stimulation, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation. muscle evoked potentials elicited by transcranial electric stimulation and h-reflexes did not change. neurone specific enolase concentrations remained stable throughout the experiments.   conclusions cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation is capable of inducing prolonged excitability reductions in the human motor cortex non-invasively. these changes are most probably localised intracortically.
regulation of intracellular zn homeostasis in two intestinal epithelial cell models at various maturation time points the uptake, intracellular distribution and cytotoxicity of high doses of extracellular zinc was investigated in c6 rat glioma cells. net zinc uptake occurred only above certain thresholds in time and concentration, below them no alterations of the intracellular zinc level were observed. these results were obtained by measurements with the fluorescent dye zinquin and by atomic absorption spectrometry, yielding similar results with both methods. sequestration of zinc in intracellular vesicles was observed by fluorescence microscopy. a protective effect of vesicular sequestration is indicated, because increased levels of intracellular zinc located in vesicles did not necessarily lead to an increase in cytotoxicity. we were able to show that in c6 cells, in contrast to other cell lines, zinc that is released from proteins by the no donor snoc is also sequestered in vesicular structures. these zinc-carrying vesicles showed to be constitutive and are assumed to have a function in the maintainance of the cytosolic content of zn2+ ions.
methionine flux to transsulfuration is enhanced in the long living ames dwarf mouse factors affecting longevity are complex and poorly understood. we have recently found that ames dwarf mice (df/df), which are deficient in growth hormone (gh), prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, live significantly longer than their normal siblings whereas transgenic mice that overexpress gh exhibit reduced life-spans and various indices of premature aging. the production of reactive oxygen species increases with aging and is associated with dna damage to the tissues. however, several cellular oxygen scavenging/detoxifying systems exist that improve the antioxidative defense capacity of cells. we evaluated the activity of enzymes involved in this defense system in liver, kidney, and heart tissue from dwarf, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-bovine gh transgenic, and corresponding groups of normal mice. liver glutathione and ascorbate levels were lower (p<0.0025) in dwarf animals compared to normal and gh transgenic mice. by contrast, the level of catalase activity, which detoxifies hydrogen peroxide, in dwarf liver and kidney was significantly higher when compared to the other groups. animals deficient in gh (dwarf) live longer and exhibit enzyme activities and levels that may combat oxidative stress more efficiently than normal mice and those overexpressing gh.
major metacestodes in cattle slaughtered at wolaita soddo municipal abattoir, southern ethiopia: prevalence, cyst viability, organ distribution and socioeconomic implications objective the study was conducted between october 2005 and april 2006 in awassa town and its surroundings to investigate the status of t. saginata taeniasis, its socio-economic importance and potential risk factors.   methods questionnaire survey was conducted on 120 volunteer individuals selected at random. additionally, retrospective study on taenicidal drugs inventories at 12 pharmaceutical shops was conducted.   results t. saginata taeniasis was a wide spread problem in the town and its surroundings with overall prevalence of 64.2% (77 out of 120) and maximum infection frequencies of five times per year. the prevalence of taeniasis was significantly varied between religion, occupation, raw meat consumption and use of spices with raw meat. accordingly, christian communities (or = 5.2, 95% ci = 1.20-22.50), high-risk groups (or = 4.05, 95% ci = 1.27-12.93), raw meat consumers (or = 7.9, 95% ci = 2.46-5.66), and spices users (or = 11.6, 95% ci = 2.85-47.28) had higher likelihood of acquiring taeniasis than muslim communities, low risk groups, cooked meat eaters and non-spices users, respectively. conversely, prevalence was not varied between sex, age, marital status and educational backgrounds of the respondents. respondents' preferences to available taenicidal drugs had strong linear relationship with drug dose sold (r2 = 0.92), and showed that niclosamide (46.8%) was the drug of first choice while praziquantel (13%) was the least preferred drug. the taenicidal drug doses and treatment cost from 2002 to 2005 were estimated to be 4,913,346 adult doses and 820,343 usd (7,219,021 eth. birr as per rate of 2006).   conclusion taeniasis was a wide spread problem with higher prevalence and frequent infections in the town and its surroundings. sociocultural conditions and occupation were the major risk factors for the occurrence of the disease. hence, owing to its public health and economic importance, taeniasis deserves serious attention in order to safeguard the public health.
retrieval of images using mean-shift and gaussian mixtures based on weighted color histograms this paper presents a novel bag of features (bof) method for image classification. the bof approach describes an image as a set of local descriptors using a histogram, where each bin represents the importance of a visual word. this indexing approach has been frequently used for image classification, and we have seen several implementations, but crucial representation choices — such as the weighting schemes — have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. in our work, we propose a fuzzy model as an alternative to known weighting schemes in order to create more representative image signatures. furthermore, we use the fuzzy signatures to train the gaussian naïve bayesian network and classify images. experiments with corel-1000 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the known implementations.
the validity and reliability of an arabic version of the stop-bang questionnaire for identifying obstructive sleep apnea this study compared the predictive abilities of the stop-bang and epworth sleepiness scale (ess) for screening sleep clinic patients for obstructive sleep apnea (osa) and sleep-disordered breathing (sdb). forty-seven new adult patients without previous diagnoses of osa or sdb were administered the stop-bang and ess and were assigned to osa or sdb risk groups based on their scores. stop-bang responses were scored with two body mass index cut points of 35 and 30 kg/m(2) (sb35 and sb30). the tools' predictive abilities were determined by comparing patients' predicted osa and sdb risks to their polysomnographic results. the sb30 correctly identified more patients with osa and sdb than the ess alone. the ess had the highest specificity for osa and sdb.
synergy between the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin and the human recombinant alpha-galactosidase a in cultured fibroblasts from patients with fabry disease in spite of the progress in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases (lsds), in some of these disorders the available therapies show limited efficacy and a need exists to identify novel therapeutic strategies. we studied the combination of enzyme replacement and enzyme enhancement by pharmacological chaperones in pompe disease (pd), a metabolic myopathy caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal acid α-glucosidase. we showed that coincubation of pompe fibroblasts with recombinant human α-glucosidase and the chaperone n-butyldeoxynojirimycin (nb-dnj) resulted in more efficient correction of enzyme activity. the chaperone improved α-glucosidase delivery to lysosomes, enhanced enzyme maturation, and increased enzyme stability. improved enzyme correction was also found in vivo in a mouse model of pd treated with coadministration of single infusions of recombinant human α-glucosidase and oral nb-dnj. the enhancing effect of chaperones on recombinant enzymes was also observed in fibroblasts from another lysosomal disease, fabry disease, treated with recombinant α-galactosidase a and the specific chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (dgj). these results have important clinical implications, as they demonstrate synergy between pharmacological chaperones and enzyme replacement. a synergistic effect of these treatments may result particularly useful in patients responding poorly to therapy and in tissues in which sufficient enzyme levels are difficult to obtain.
relationships between feeding behaviour and feed intake in dairy cows during early lactation the suitability of a statistical model for describing within-day feeding behavior, and potential relationships between model parameters and commonly measured experimental variables were examined. forty multiparous, midlactation holstein cows were fed using a real-time control system to record the date of each visit to a feeder, entrance time, exit time, and feed consumed over a 6-wk period. daily feed consumption, number of visits, meal duration, and within-visit rate of food intake were then calculated. two peaks in within-day rates of feed intake were indicated, suggesting that feeding activity was randomly distributed around each peak, that is, binormal. parameters describing the distributions (means, standard deviations, and the percentage of total feeding activity associated with each peak) were estimated. an adjusted average of 91% of the variation in within-day feeding activity was explained by the binormal model. relationships between model parameters and commonly measured experimental variables were also identified; behavioral traits were correlated with total feed intake. feeding activity patterns in literature data were also amenable to reanalysis by the binormal model. lactating cows consistently exhibited a distinct diurnal pattern in feeding activity; they were most active near sunrise and again near sunset (crepuscular). effects of various management operations (e.g., feeding and milking times and frequencies, and lighting) on within-day feeding patterns remain to be established, although a statistical model for evaluating them is now available. the patterns may have important implications for scheduling management activities to maximize feed intake and production.
the impact of childhood emotional abuse and experiential avoidance on maladaptive problem solving and intimate partner violence the problem of domestic violence is widespread, with research indicating men and women both perpetrate a substantial amount of aggression. however, aggression perpetrated by women is a relatively understudied area compared to aggression perpetrated by men. additionally, research is needed to determine the correlates of aggression perpetration among women, as this can inform more effective treatment programs. thus, the current study sought to examine the association between trait anger and impulsivity and the perpetration of physical and psychological intimate partner violence (ipv) and general aggression among women arrested for domestic violence (n = 80). findings indicated that both trait anger and impulsivity were significantly associated with aggression perpetration and trait anger mediated the relationship between impulsivity and aggression perpetration. directions for future research and violence intervention programs are discussed.
hdac inhibitor sodium butyrate-mediated epigenetic regulation enhances neuroprotective function of microglia during ischemic stroke in the healthy adult brain, neurogenesis normally occurs in the subventricular zone (svz) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (dg). cerebral ischemia enhances neurogenesis in neurogenic and non‐neurogenic regions of the ischemic brain of adult rodents. this study demonstrated that post‐insult treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate (sb), stimulated the incorporation of bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (brdu) in the svz, dg, striatum, and frontal cortex in the ischemic brain of rats subjected to permanent cerebral ischemia. sb treatment also increased the number of cells expressing polysialic acid–neural cell adhesion molecule, nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, phospho‐camp response element‐binding protein (creb), and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) in various brain regions after cerebral ischemia. furthermore, extensive co‐localization of brdu and polysialic acid–neural cell adhesion molecule was observed in multiple regions after ischemia, and sb treatment up‐regulated protein levels of bdnf, phospho‐creb, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. intraventricular injection of k252a, a tyrosine kinase b receptor antagonist, markedly reduced sb‐induced cell proliferation detected by brdu and ki67 in the ipsilateral svz, dg, and other brain regions, blocked sb‐induced nestin expression and creb activation, and attenuated the long‐lasting behavioral benefits of sb. together, these results suggest that histone deacetylase inhibitor‐induced cell proliferation, migration and differentiation require bdnf–tyrosine kinase b signaling and may contribute to long‐term beneficial effects of sb after ischemic injury.
tms modulation of visual and auditory processing in the posterior parietal cortex although the importance of the posterior parietal and prefrontal regions in spatial localization of visual stimuli is well established, their role in auditory space perception is less clear. using positron emission tomography (pet) during auditory and visual spatial localization in the same subjects, modality-specific areas were identified in the superior parietal lobule, middle temporal and lateral prefrontal cortices. these findings suggest that, similar to the visual system, the hierarchical organization of the auditory system extends beyond the temporal lobe to include areas in the posterior parietal and prefrontal regions specialized in auditory spatial processing. our results may explain the dissociation of visual and auditory spatial localization deficits following lesions involving these regions.
risk factors for prostate cancer detection after a negative biopsy: a novel multivariable longitudinal approach. objectives to assess the current incidence of prostate carcinoma detection in serial biopsies in a prostate-specific antigen-based screening population after a diagnosis of isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (hg-pin) in needle biopsy tissue.   methods we retrospectively identified 190 men with a diagnosis of isolated hg-pin in needle biopsy tissue. most men (86%) were diagnosed from 1996 to 2000. logistic regression analysis was used to predict the presence of carcinoma in these 190 men and in a control group of 1677 men with only benign prostatic tissue in needle biopsy tissue.   results the cumulative risk of detection of carcinoma on serial sextant follow-up biopsies was 30.5% for those with isolated hg-pin compared with 26.2% for the control group (p = 0.2). patient age (p = 0.03) and serum prostate-specific antigen level (p = 0.02) were significantly linked to the risk of cancer detection, but suspicious digital rectal examination findings (p = 0.1), the presence of hg-pin (p = 0.2), and the histologic attributes of pin were not (all with nonsignificant p values). hg-pin found on the first repeat biopsy was associated with a 41% risk of subsequent detection of carcinoma compared with an 18% risk if benign prostatic tissue was found on the first repeat biopsy (p = 0.01).   conclusions the results of our study have shown that the current level of risk for the detection of prostate carcinoma in a screened population is 30.5% after a diagnosis of isolated hg-pin in a needle biopsy. this risk level is lower than the previously reported risk of 33% to 50%. hg-pin is a risk factor for carcinoma detection only when found on consecutive sextant biopsies. the data presented here should prompt reconsideration of repeat biopsy strategies for hg-pin, and re-evaluation of the absolute necessity of repeat biopsy for all patients with hg-pin.
evaluation of argos telemetry accuracy in the high-arctic and implications for the estimation of home-range size study of animal movements is key for understanding their ecology and facilitating their conservation. the argos satellite system is a valuable tool for tracking species which move long distances, inhabit remote areas, and are otherwise difficult to track with traditional vhf telemetry and are not suitable for gps systems. previous research has raised doubts about the magnitude of position errors quoted by the satellite service provider cls. in addition, no peer-reviewed publications have evaluated the usefulness of the cls supplied error ellipses nor the accuracy of the new kalman filtering (kf) processing method. using transmitters hung from towers and trees in southeastern peru, we show the argos error ellipses generally contain <25% of the true locations and therefore do not adequately describe the true location errors. we also find that kf processing does not significantly increase location accuracy. the errors for both ls and kf processing methods were found to be lognormally distributed, which has important repercussions for error calculation, statistical analysis, and data interpretation. in brief, “good” positions (location codes 3, 2, 1, a) are accurate to about 2 km, while 0 and b locations are accurate to about 5–10 km. however, due to the lognormal distribution of the errors, larger outliers are to be expected in all location codes and need to be accounted for in the user’s data processing. we evaluate five different empirical error estimates and find that 68% lognormal error ellipses provided the most useful error estimates. longitude errors are larger than latitude errors by a factor of 2 to 3, supporting the use of elliptical error ellipses. numerous studies over the past 15 years have also found fault with the cls-claimed error estimates yet cls has failed to correct their misleading information. we hope this will be reversed in the near future.
talin, vinculin and nestin expression in orofacial muscles of dystrophin deficient mdx mice we describe the expression and distribution patterns of nestin, desmin and vimentin in intact and regenerating muscle spindles of the rat hind limb skeletal muscles. regeneration was induced by intramuscular isotransplantation of extensor digitorum longus (edl) or soleus muscles from 15-day-old rats into the edl muscle of adult female inbred lewis rats. the host muscles with grafts were excised after 7-, 16-, 21- and 29-day survival and immunohistochemically stained. nestin expression in intact spindles in host muscles was restricted to schwann cells of sensory and motor nerves. in transplanted muscles, however, nestin expression was also found in regenerating “spindle fibers”, 7 and 16 days after grafting. from the 21st day onwards, the regenerated spindle fibers were devoid of nestin immunoreactivity. desmin was detected in spindle fibers at all developmental stages in regenerating as well as in intact spindles. vimentin was expressed in cells of the outer and inner capsules of all muscle spindles and in newly formed myoblasts and myotubes of regenerating spindles 7 days after grafting. our results show that the expression pattern of these intermediate filaments in regenerating spindle fibers corresponds to that found in regenerating extrafusal fibers, which supports our earlier suggestion that they resemble small-diameter extrafusal fibers.
peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness profile determined with high speed, ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography high-density scanning. aimsto establish four normal retinal nerve fibre layer (rnfl) thickness radial profiles based on third-generation optical coherence tomography (oct) and to compare them with previously reported histologic measurements.methodsa total of 20 normal eyes were studied. a circular scan was adjusted to the size of the optic disc and three scans were performed with this radius and every 200 μm thereafter, up to a distance of 1400 μm. four different radial sections (superotemporal, superonasal, inferonasal, and inferotemporal) were studied to establish rnfl thickness oct profiles. additionally, two radial scans orientated at 45 and 135° crossing the optic disc centre were performed in six of 20 eyes, and rnfl thickness was measured at disc margin.resultsquadrant location and distance from disc margin interaction in rnfl thickness was statistically significant (p<0.001). the rnfl thickness decreased (p<0.001) as the distance from the disc margin increased for all sections. the measurements automatically generated by the oct built-in software were thinner (p<0.001) than histologic ones close to the disc margin.conclusionsfour normal oct rnfl profiles were established and compared with histological data obtained from the same area. rnfl measurements assessed by oct 3 were significantly thinner close to the optic disc margin.
mechanism of substrate recognition and plp-induced conformational changes in ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase from arabidopsis thaliana. three-dimensional structures are reported for a mutant (betak87t) tryptophan synthase alpha2beta2 complex with either the substrate l-serine (betak87t-ser) or product l-tryptophan (betak87t-trp) at the active site of the beta-subunit, in which both amino acids form external aldimines with the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate. we also present structures with l-serine bound to the beta site and either alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate (betak87t-ser-gp) or indole-3-propanol phosphate (betak87t-ser-ipp) bound to the active site of the alpha-subunit. the results further identify the substrate and product binding sites in each subunit and provide insight into conformational changes that occur upon formation of these complexes. the two structures having ligands at the active sites of both alpha- and beta-subunits reveal an important new feature, the ordering of alpha-subunit loop 6 (residues 179-187). closure of loop 6 isolates the active site of the alpha-subunit from solvent and results in interaction between alphathr183 and the catalytic residue alphaasp60. other conformational differences between the wild type and these two mutant structures include a rigid-body rotation of the alpha-subunit of approximately 5 degrees relative to the beta-subunit and large movements of part of the beta-subunit (residues 93-189) toward the rest of the beta-subunit. much smaller differences are observed in the betak87t-ser structure. remarkably, binding of tryptophan to the beta active site results in conformational changes very similar to those observed in the betak87t-ser-gp and betak87t-ser-ipp structures, with exception of the disordered alpha-subunit loop 6. these large-scale changes, the closure of loop 6, and the movements of a small number of side chains in the alpha-beta interaction site provide a structural base for interpreting the allosteric properties of tryptophan synthase.
the effects of sexual experience and estrus on male-seeking motivated behavior in the female rat choice of a male or female social contact was studied in intact female rats in a runway-choice apparatus during estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation. the male was chosen significantly more often during proestrus/estrus than during the diestrous days of the cycle. during pregnancy this preference in choice declined only to reappear gradually during the lactation period. the shifts in the level of motivation to seek out the male support previous studies and point to the significance of estrogen in producing the preference for the male.
parkin somatic mutations link melanoma and parkinson's disease. the parkin was first identified as a gene implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. deregulation of the parkin gene, however, has been observed in various human cancers, suggesting that the parkin gene may be important in tumorigenesis. to gain insight into the physiologic role of parkin, we generated parkin−/− mice lacking exon 3 of the parkin gene. we demonstrated here that parkin−/− mice had enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and developed macroscopic hepatic tumors with the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. microarray analyses revealed that parkin deficiency caused the alteration of gene expression profiles in the liver. among them, endogenous follistatin is commonly upregulated in both nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues of parkin-deficient mice. parkin deficiency resulted in suppression of caspase activation and rendered hepatocytes resistant to apoptosis in a follistatin-dependent manner. these results suggested that parkin deficiency caused enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, resulting in hepatic tumor development, partially through the upregulation of endogenous follistatin. the finding that parkin-deficient mice are susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis provided the first evidence showing that parkin is indeed a tumor suppressor gene.
load handling and repetitive movements are associated with chronic low back pain among jute mill workers in india a cross-sectional study of 150 adult bengalee hindu male jute mill workers of belur, a suburb of kolkata, west bengal, india, was undertaken to study the relationship of age, body mass index (bmi) and waist circumference (wc) with systolic (sbp), diastolic (dbp) and mean arterial (map) blood pressure. the mean age and the bmi of the subjects were 40.7 years (s.d. = 15.2) and 23.2 kg/m2 (s.d. = 3.2), respectively. the mean sbp, dbp and map were 124.7 mmhg (s.d. = 7.8), 81.5 mmhg (s.d. = 5.7) and 95.9 mmhg (s.d. = 6.1), respectively. age had similar significant (p < 0.001) correlations with bmi and wc. age and wc were significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with all the three blood pressure variables. in general, the correlations of bmi with sbp (r = 0.24, p < 0.01), dbp (r = 0.15, n.s.) and map (r = 0.19, p < 0.05) were weaker. age controlled multiple regression analyses demonstrated that bmi did not have a significant effect of any blood pressure variable. however, wc had a significant impact (p < 0.0001) on sbp (t = 7.068), dbp (t = 5.190) and map (t = 6.387), even after adjusting for the effect of age. moreover, even after age adjustment, percent variations in sbp (20.7%), dbp (12.5%) and map (17.2%) explained by wc were high. this significant impact (p < 0.0001) of wc on sbp (t = 9.426), dbp (t = 8.349) and map (t = 9.642) remained even after controlling for the combined effects of age and bmi.
exogenous orienting of crossmodal attention in 3-d space: support for a depth-aware crossmodal attentional system two experiments were conducted to explore whether attentional selection occurs in depth, or whether attentional focus is “depth blind,” as suggested by ghiradelli and folk (1996). in experiment 1, observers viewed stereoscopic displays in which one of four spatial locations was cued. two of the locations were at a near-depth location and two were at a far-depth location, and a single target was presented along with three distractors. the results indicated a larger cost in reaction time for switching attention inx,y and depth than inx,y alone, supporting a “depth-aware” attentional spotlight. in experiment 2, no distractors were present, similar to the displays used by ghiradelli and folk. in this experiment, no effect for switching attention in depth was found, indicating that the selectivity of attention in depth depends on the perceptual load imposed on observers by the tasks and displays.
astragalus membranaceus extract attenuates inflammation and oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells via nf-κb activation and nrf2 response astragalus membranaceus, also known as huang qi, a traditional chinese medicine, is often used in formulas for deficiency of vital energy characterized by limb weakness, pale face, and dizziness. previous studies have shown that astragalus membranaceus could attenuate intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by hemorrhagic shock in rats; however, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. using a hemorrhagic shock rat model to examine the effect of astragalus membranaceus on intestinal mucosa injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion, we found that treatment (20 g crude drugs/kg, i.v.) produced antioxidative effects in the intestinal mucosa of rats after ischemia-reperfusion (p < 0.05). we also found that astragalus membranaceus could partly attenuate intestinal mucosa ischemia-reperfusion injury (chiu's score, apoptosis index p < 0.05). these results suggest that astragalus membranaceus reduces intestinal mucosa injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats, at least in part, through its anti-oxidative effects.
combined volumetry and dti in subcortical structures of mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease patients. purpose to compare the regional diffusivity of water in the brains of normally aging elderly people and patients with mild cognitive impairment (mci) or alzheimer disease.   materials and methods magnetic resonance images were obtained in 21 patients with alzheimer disease, 19 patients with mci, and 55 normally aging elderly control subjects without evidence of cognitive impairment. regions of interest were drawn to compare the apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) and the anisotropy index (ai) in frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, anterior, and posterior cingulate white matter (wm), and the thalami and hippocampi.   results hippocampal adc was higher in mci and alzheimer disease patients than in control subjects. adc of the temporal stem and posterior cingulate, occipital, and parietal wm was higher in alzheimer disease patients than in control subjects. except for occipital ai, which was lower in mci patients than in control subjects, there were no differences in ai among the three groups for any of the regions.   conclusion hippocampal adc was significantly different between control subjects and mci patients, many of whom likely have preclinical alzheimer disease. elevation in hippocampal adc may reflect early ultrastructural changes in the progression of alzheimer disease.
cardiopulmonary toxicity of peat wildfire particulate matter and the predictive utility of precision cut lung slices an intensive field study was conducted in sumatra, indonesia, during a peat fire episode to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of particulate emissions in peat smoke and to provide necessary data for source-receptor analyses. ambient air sampling was carried out at three different sites located at varying distances from the peatfires to determine changes in mass and number concentrations of pm2.5 and its chemical composition (carbonaceous and nitrogenous materials, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, water-soluble inorganic and organic ions, and total and water-soluble metals). the three sites represent a rural site directly affected by the local peat combustion, a semirural site, and an urban site situated downwind of the peat fires. the mass concentration of pm2.5 and the number concentration of airborne particles were as high as 1600 microg/m3 and 1.7 x 10(5) cm(-3), respectively, in the vicinity of peat fires. the major components of pm2.5 in peat smoke haze were carbonaceous particles, particularly organic carbon, no3-, and so4(2-), while the less abundant constituents included ions such as nh4+, no2-, na+, k+, organic acids, and metals such as al, fe, and ti. source apportionment by chemical mass balance receptor modeling indicates that peat smoke can travel long distances and significantly affect the air quality at locations downwind.
incidence of tooth loss in adults: a 4-year population-based prospective cohort study objective to assess the relative contribution of caries and periodontal disease to tooth loss over 24 years in a cohort deprived of regular dental care.   material & methods the study population consisted of 98 subjects from a tea estate on west java, indonesia, that had been part of a prospective longitudinal study and provided full datasets of clinical assessments between 1987, 1994 and 2002. in 2011, complete sets of dental radiographs were made which was combined with the survey forms and clinical slides from the previous assessments in order to estimate reasons for tooth loss.   results thirty-seven subjects lost no teeth, whereas 61 subjects lost 185 teeth. in this group, 45.9% lost ≤2 teeth, 32.8% lost 3 to 4 teeth and 19.7% lost ≥5 teeth. the majority of teeth were lost due to caries. in five subjects, tooth loss could be attributed solely to periodontitis, whereas in four subjects teeth were lost due to both caries and periodontits. analyses of the predictor variables age, gender, smoking, education, presence of caries and severe periodontitis showed that male gender and caries were significantly associated with tooth loss.   conclusion the majority of teeth in this population were lost due to caries.
nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a south european population: epidemiological data and clinical aspects in portugal information concerning the descriptive and analytical epidemiology of npc that has been reported mainly since the first international symposium on the subject in singapore in 1964 are reviewed. npc is rare in most countries in the world, with an age-adjusted incidence rate of less than 1 per 100,000, and the incidence rate is twice as high in males as in females. chinese of southern origin have a uniquely high risk, the incidence rates per 100,000 being 10--20 in males and 5--10 in females. the greater the admixture of southern chinese blood in a given ethnic group, the more likely it is that the npc incidence rate in that group will be raised. the incidence in both sexes begins to rise after the ages of 20--24 and reaches a plateau at between 45 and 54. when the logarithm of mortality and morbidity is plotted against the logarithm of the age, the power of the age that provides the best fit to a straight line on a log-log graph is approximately two to four. these figures are lower than for other cancers. seroepidemiological case-control studies indicate that both different birthplace and abnormal response to ebv antigen significantly enhance the risk for npc; when these two factors are combined, the relative risk appears to rise further. the effect of other environmental chemicals, such as from cigarette smoking, shown to be significant in several retrospective studies, could explain in part epidemiological phenomena such as sex difference in incidence. the definitive reason for the uniquely high risk in southern chinese should be further investigated by taking into account the interactions of host factors (birthplace, hla, etc.) and environmental factors (ebv, chemical carcinogens including nitrosamines, excessive intake of salted fish, nutritional deficiencies, etc.).
tnf-alpha -induced endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression is cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase dependent. the present study was undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that multiple oxygen radical generating systems contribute to the tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha-stimulated transcriptional activation of the vascular cell adhesion molecule (vcam)-1 in endothelial cells. experimental evidence has implicated the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase and a phagocyte type nadph-oxidase as a source of oxygen radicals in these cells. we show here that endothelial cells exhibit cytochrome p450 activity by measuring the o-dealkylation of the exogenous substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin, but components of the phagocyte-type nadph oxidase could not be demonstrated in endothelial cells. in that latter respect it was surprising that the nadph oxidase inhibitor apocynin completely prevented the accumulation of vcam-1 mrna. however, we found that apocynin also acts as an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 activity in endothelial cells. therefore the inhibitory effect of apocynin on the induction of vcam-1 may no longer be used to demonstrate a role for the nadph oxidase in this process. furthermore, different cytochrome p450 inhibitors co2+, metyrapone, skf525a decreased the endothelial vcam-1 expression stimulated by tnfalpha. also under hypoxic conditions the expression of vcam-1 was reduced. on this basis we assume that the oxygen dependent step in the intracellular signalling cascade underlying the tnfalpha stimulated transcriptional activation of vcam-1 resides in the activity of a cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase. the finding that the phospholipase a2 inhibitor bromophenacylbromide inhibited the expression of vcam-1 may indicate that arachidonic acid serves as a substrate for the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase reaction, but further research is needed to elucidate the particular cytochrome p450 family member mediating the expression of vcam-1.
polar localization of a dihydropyridine receptor on living fucus zygotes. abstract using an ultrasensitive extracellular vibrating electrode, i have studied the membrane-generated electrical currents around the egg of the brown alga, pelvetia, between fertilization and germination. during this period, the egg chooses an elongation axis and moves wall-precursor vesicles to the prospective growth region where they are secreted. this results in visible ooplasmic segregation which appears under the light microscope as a 1- to 2-μm-thick clear band at the cortex of the growth region. a steady electrical current enters a small region of the membrane and leaves the remainder of the egg's surface as early as 30 min after fertilization. this early spatial current pattern is unstable and shifts position, often with more than one inward current region. however, current enters mainly on the side where germination will occur and is usually largest at the prospective cortical clearing region. the average measured early current density is 0.06 μa/cm2 at 50 μm from the egg's surface, implying a surface current density of between 0.2 and 1 μa/cm2 due to the extrapolation uncertainty. at germination the current increases about twofold, resulting in a total transcellular current on the order of 100 pa. unilateral growth-orienting light reversal stimulates inward current on the new dark side, and subsequent morphological polarity reversal is preceded by electrical polarity reversal. the steady current tends to increase when the external ca2+ concentration is increased or the external na+ concentration is decreased, suggesting that the current is carried in part by ca2+. this current will generate a transcellular electrical field which may be the force driving the observed ooplasmic segregation.
identification of a putative pathway for the muscle homing of stem cells in a muscular dystrophy model the protein product of the human duchenne muscular dystrophy locus (dmd) and its mouse homolog (mdmd) have been identified by using polyclonal antibodies directed against fusion proteins containing two distinct regions of the mdmd cdna. the dmd protein is shown to be approximately 400 kd and to represent approximately 0.002% of total striated muscle protein. this protein is also detected in smooth muscle (stomach). muscle tissue isolated from both dmd-affected boys and mdx mice contained no detectable dmd protein, suggesting that these genetic disorders are homologous. since mdx mice present no obvious clinical abnormalities, the identification of the mdx mouse as an animal model for dmd has important implications with regard to the etiology of the lethal dmd phenotype. we have named the protein dystrophin because of its identification via the isolation of the duchenne muscular dystrophy locus.
knowledge about the relation between tobacco and disease and the attitude toward advising the cessation of its consumption among a group of spanish dental students background ireland has some of the strictest smoking regulations in the world. little is known of the attitudes of student irish dental healthcare workers towards tobacco control and tobacco use cessation. this study aimed at determining the knowledge and attitudes of these students towards the deleterious effects of tobacco in the mouth and towards tobacco use cessation in dental practice.   method a questionnaire survey was distributed to 654 students (including newly qualified) on dentistry, dental hygiene and dental nursing programmes in irish dental schools. information sought included college, course, year of study, sex, age, nationality, smoking status, knowledge of effects of tobacco in the mouth and attitudes towards tobacco use cessation in dental practice and towards the irish smoking bans.   main findings there was a 90% response rate. in all, 12% of dental students, 25% of dental hygiene students and 31% of dental nursing students were current smokers. newly qualified dental hygienists were as knowledgeable about tobacco effects in the mouth as newly qualified dentists. overall, the majority in each student category believed that all three groups could be effective tobacco counsellors and should provide tobacco use cessation counselling to patients, although less than half of evening course dental nursing students felt that dental nurses could be effective counsellors or should provide counselling. there was overwhelming support for the irish smoking ban. only a minority of dental students and dental nursing students had received instruction in tobacco use cessation counselling.   conclusions there are strong positive attitudes to tobacco use cessation counselling in dental practice among these young dental healthcare students. this is true even amongst those who have not received specific instruction in tobacco use cessation counselling.
effects of restricted feeding of prepubertal ewe lambs on growth performance and mammary gland development. the effects of rapid weight gain to puberty on reproduction, mammary development and milk production in ewes lambing at 13 mo of age were investigated on three trials. a total of 64 dorset and 93 suffolk ewe lambs were weaned at 42 d of age and their mean weight was 16 kg. these ewes were assigned, within breed groups, to either a finishing diet or a growing diet. onset of puberty was determined by daily checks for estrus and ewes were bred beginning at 7 mo of age. in trial 2, mammary gland development was determined in eight suffolk ewes from each diet. ewes on the finishing diet were younger at puberty than those on the growing diet (199 vs 206 d, p<0.05) but required more services per conception (1.3 vs 1.1, p<0.05). dietary conception rate and lambing rate means were similar. mean 4-h milk yield was lower (p<0.10) for ewes on the finishing diet (283 g) than for those on the growing diet (310 g). mammary gland fat pad area was higher (p<0.05) for ewes on the finishing diet compared with those fed for growth. gross and adjusted duct areas were higher in ewes on the growing diet, but differences were not significant. at puberty, negative correlation coefficients for milk yield with performance traits were as follows: daily weight gain, -0.184 (p<0.08); weight-to-height ratio -0.262 (p<0.01); body condition score, -0.189 (p<0.07); and body weight, -0.212 (p<0.05). results of this study indicate that rapid weight gain to puberty impairs mammary gland development and milk production in ewe lambs.
distribution of primary immunodeficiency disorders diagnosed in the children's medical center in iran. background advances in immunologic techniques in recent years have led to increased recognition of primary immunodeficiency disorders, with iga deficiency the most common phenotype reported by most registries. there have also been reports of increased associated incidence of autoimmunity, allergy, and other diseases.   objectives we wished to determine the percentage of different primary immunodeficiency disorders seen in a pediatric tertiary hospital and to determine the association of primary immunodeficiency disorders with other diseases that are not part of classic immunodeficiency disorders.   methods we performed a retrospective review of the patients referred to our allergy/immunology clinic for immunologic evaluation of recurrent infections during an 8-year period. we also reviewed pathology reports with postmortem diagnosis of immunodeficiencies not identified while patients were alive.   results of the 91 patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders evaluated, the majority had predominantly antibody deficiencies (67%). the most common phenotype was specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins (23.1%), defined as inability to mount an adequate response to pneumococcal polysaccharides followed by igg2 subclass deficiency (17.6%). these two phenotypes were diagnosed mostly in the last 2 years of the survey. associated diseases, found in 40% of patients, were mostly allergic conditions followed by syndromic/chromosomal disorders.   conclusion the study reveals that specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins followed by igg2 subclass deficiency was the most frequently diagnosed primary immunodeficiency disorder in our patient population. it also indicates that immunodeficiency disorders should be considered in patients with other abnormalities like allergic and syndromic/chromosomal disorders that present with recurrent infections.
deepproblog: neural probabilistic logic programming given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. in this paper, we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge for neural networks, such as knowing how a program should traverse a sequence, but not what local actions should be performed at each step. to this end, we present an end-to-end differentiable interpreter for the programming language forth which enables programmers to write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. we can optimise this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user-specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. we show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex behaviours such as sequence sorting and addition. when connected to outputs of an lstm and trained jointly, our interpreter achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for end-to-end reasoning about quantities expressed in natural language stories.
cocaine locomotor activation, sensitization and place preference in six inbred strains of mice a meta-analysis was conducted on the data obtained from published articles that have used the conditioned place preference (cpp) paradigm to assess the rewarding effects of morphine, heroin, amphetamine and cocaine in rats. using a histogram analysis of the data, significant dose-effect curves were evident with all of the drugs examined, except for cocaine. analysis of the data also revealed that several methodological variables moderated the effect size for cpp, at least with some of the drugs examined. in particular, the following methodological variables significantly moderated cpp effect size: strain of rat used; housing condition (single or group cages); type of apparatus (2 or 3 compartments); preconditioning test (present or absent); route of drug administration; intervening saline trials (present or absent); conditioning trial duration; and drug compartment (nonpreferred, counterbalanced or white). no significant effect size differences were evident using sex, number of drug trials, or test duration as moderator variables in the analyses. these meta-analytic results may be useful to investigators for maximizing the effect size of drug-induced cpp.
changes in prefrontal and amygdala activity during olanzapine treatment in schizophrenia introduction patients with schizophrenia show deficits in facial affect and facial identity recognition and exhibit structural and neurophysiological abnormalities in brain regions known to mediate these processes. functional neuroimaging studies of neural responses to emotional facial expressions in schizophrenia have reported both increases and decreases in medial temporal lobe (mtl) activity in schizophrenia. some of this variability may be related to the tasks performed and the baseline conditions used. here we tested whether mtl responses to human faces in schizophrenia are abnormal when unconstrained by a cognitive task and measured relative to a low-level baseline (fixation) condition.   methods 15 patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while passively viewing human faces displaying fearful, happy, and neutral emotional expressions.   results relative to control subjects, the patients demonstrated (1) significantly greater activation of the left hippocampus while viewing all three facial expressions and (2) increased right amygdala activation during the initial presentation of fearful and neutral facial expressions.   conclusions in schizophrenia, hippocampal and amygdala activity is elevated during the passive viewing of human faces.
systematic prediction of scaffold proteins reveals new design principles in scaffold-mediated signal transduction budding yeast contain at least four distinct mapk (mitogen activated protein kinase) cascades that transduce a variety of intracellular signals: mating-pheromone response, pseudohyphal/invasive growth, cell wall integrity, and high osmolarity adaptation. although each mapk cascade contains a conserved set of three protein kinases, the upstream activation mechanisms for these cascades are diverse, including a trimeric g protein, monomeric small g proteins, and a prokaryotic-like two-component system. recently, it became apparent that there is extensive sharing of signaling elements among the mapk pathways; however, little undesirable cross-talk occurs between various cascades. the formation of multi-protein signaling complexes is probably centrally important for this insulation of individual mapk cascades.
service utilization by hospitalized suicide attempters with schizophrenia or depression in montreal. utilization of health care services has been found to differ between psychiatric disorders. however, the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with mental disorders is not known. this study systematically investigated the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum versus mood disorders with or without comorbid substance use disorders both before and after attempted suicide. all consecutive medically treated suicide attempters in helsinki from january 15, 1997, to january 14, 1998, were identified (n = 1,198). data were gathered on all their health care contacts within the 12 months before and after the index attempt. whereas the clear majority of all suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders had a treatment contact during the 30 days following the attempt, half of those with pure substance use disorders were without any contact with health care. comorbid substance use made treatment less likely after attempted suicide among both psychiatric disorder groups; those with schizophrenia spectrum and comorbid substance use disorders were seven times more often left without aftercare recommendation than those without substance use comorbidity. comorbid substance use disorders among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum disorders decrease the likelihood of active aftercare, despite high suicide risk.
selection of normal spermatozoa with a vacuole‐free head (x6300) improves selection of spermatozoa with intact dna in patients with high sperm dna fragmentation rates purposewe used computer assisted sperm selection (msome) during cycles of intracytoplasmic sperm injection to test whether this technique improves results over traditional icsi protocols. we also used the tunel assay to test whether msome could deselect physiologically abnormal spermatozoa.methodsindividual spermatozoa were examined with msome. normal and abnormal spermatozoa were tested for the level of dna fragmentation using tunel assay. in a prospective, randomized trial, patients were selected for standard icsi, or imsi techniques. we tested the two groups for biological and clinical parameters.results64.8% of spermatozoa, otherwise selectable for icsi, were characterized by abnormalities after computer-assisted sperm analysis. these sperm were also characterized by an increase in the level of dna fragmentation. we noted an increase in embryo quality, pregnancy and implantation rates after computerized sperm selection during icsi procedures.conclusionscomputerised selection of spermatozoa during icsi procedures deselects physiological abnormal spermatozoa and improves clinical results.
zero erucic acid trait of rapeseed (brassica napus l.) results from a deletion of four base pairs in the fatty acid elongase 1 gene genomic fatty acid elongation 1 (fae1) clones from high erucic acid (hea) brassica napus, brassica rapa and brassica oleracea, and low erucic acid (lea) b. napus cv. westar, were amplified by pcr and expressed in yeast cells under the control of the strong galactose-inducible promoter. as expected, yeast cells expressing the fae1 genes from hea brassica spp. synthesized very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids that are not normally found in yeast, while fatty acid profiles of yeast cells expressing the fae1 gene from lea b. napus were identical to control yeast samples. in agreement with published findings regarding different hea and lea b. napus cultivars, comparison of fae1 protein sequences from hea and lea brassicaceae revealed one crucial amino acid difference: the serine residue at position 282 of the hea fae1 sequences is substituted by phenylalanine in lea b. napus cv. westar. using site directed mutagenesis, the phenylalanine 282 residue was substituted with a serine residue in the fae1 polypeptide from b. napus cv. westar, the mutated gene was expressed in yeast and gc analysis revealed the presence of very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids (vlcmfas), indicating that the elongase activity was restored in the lea fae1 enzyme by the single amino acid substitution. thus, for the first time, the low erucic acid trait in canola b. napus can be attributed to a single amino acid substitution which prevents the biosynthesis of the eicosenoic and erucic acids.
lyophilization to improve drug delivery for chitosan-calcium phosphate bone scaffold construct: a preliminary investigation. our contemporary understanding of bone healing has evolved due to knowledge gleaned from a continuous interaction between basic laboratory investigations and clinical observations following procedures to augment healing of fractures, osseous defects, and unstable joints. the stages of bone healing parallel the early stages of bone development. the bone healing process is greatly influenced by a variety of systemic and local factors. a thorough understanding of the basic science of bone healing as well as the many factors that can affect it is critical to the management of a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. in particular, the evolving management of spinal disorders can greatly benefit from the advancement of our understanding of the principles of bone healing.
cytoplasmic condensation is both necessary and sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death a common event that occurs during apoptosis is a loss of cell volume, but little information is available on its role in the cell death process. lymphocytes undergo apoptosis in response to glucocorticoids and exhibit cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, internucleosomal dna fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. interestingly, only cells that exhibit a loss in cell volume degrade their dna. to determine if physical shrinkage was sufficient to initiate apoptosis, s49 neo lymphocytes were cultured in hypertonic medium. the normal osmolarity (approximately 300 mosm) of tissue culture medium was increased to either 550 or 800 mosm, using impermeant sugars such as mannitol and sucrose or nacl. these hypertonic conditions led to a rapid killing of s49 neo cells. evaluation of the mode of cell death revealed that these hypertonic conditions resulted in apoptosis. unlike glucocorticoid-induced cell death, hypertonically induced apoptosis did not require protein synthesis. when s49 neo cells were cultured under hypotonic conditions, the cells swelled but apoptosis did not occur. analysis of several cell types revealed that all lymphoid cells examined (s49 neo, cem-c7, primary thymocytes) undergo apoptosis in response to hypertonic conditions, whereas several other cell types (l cells, cos, hela, gh3) did not. although these nonlymphoid cells showed a similar initial reduction in cell volume in response to hypertonic conditions, they subsequently maintained volume or regulated back to a near normal cell volume. these data indicate that thymic lymphoid cells have the machinery in place for rapid induction of apoptosis in response to physical shrinkage, whereas other cell types resist shrinkage-induced apoptosis by the activation of cell volume regulatory mechanisms.
cell-penetrating peptides as transporters for morpholino oligomers: effects of amino acid composition on intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity certain proteins contain subunits that enable their active translocation across the plasma membrane into cells. in the specific case of hiv-1, this subunit is the basic domain tat(49-57) (rkkrrqrrr). to establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. all truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. in contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (r9) was 20-fold more efficient than tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by michaelis-menton kinetic analysis. the d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (n-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to tat(49-57) and even to r9. overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared.
enzymatic activity of glutathione s-transferase and dental fluorosis among children receiving two different levels of naturally fluoridated water we studied the effects of combined exposure to arsenic and fluoride on (i) brain biogenic amines, oxidative stress and its correlation with glutathione and linked enzymes; (ii) alterations in the structural integrity of dna; and (iii) brain and blood arsenic and fluoride levels. efficacy of alpha-tocopherol in reducing these changes was also determined. male mice were exposed to sodium meta arsenite (50 ppm) and sodium fluoride (50 ppm) individually and in combination for ten weeks. animals were given vitamin e supplementation (5 mg/kg, i.m., alternate days) throughout the experiment. exposure to arsenic and fluoride significantly decreased the levels of brain biogenic amines. however; acetyl cholinesterase (ache) and monoamine oxidase (mao) activities showed an increase on fluoride exposure. there was also an increase in reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive species level, glutathione s-transferase and glutathione peroxidase activities and decreased superoxide dismutase activity, gsh:gssg ratio, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. combined exposure to these toxicants produced more pronounced effects on ache, mao, sod and catalase activities. infrared spectra showed less toxicity during combined exposure as the characteristic peaks of cytosine and alpha-helical structure of dna were observed in normal and arsenic plus fluoride-exposed animals. vitamin e reduced brain fluoride level and tissue oxidative stress but had no effect on arsenic. combined exposure to arsenic and fluoride does not necessarily lead to more pronounced toxicity and interestingly exhibit some antagonistic effects. vitamin e supplementation may be of added value in reverting some of the toxic effects.
favorable outcome of primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma patients treated with sequential rchop-rice regimen without radiotherapy between 1981 and 1986, 126 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma were treated with macop-b (methotrexate/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone/bleomy cin). all had advanced-stage lymphoma (ann arbor stage iii or iv or stage i or ii if the tumor mass was greater than 10 cm or b symptoms were present). the complete response (cr) rate was 84% and the toxic death rate was 6%. actuarial overall survival at 3 years was 67% and at 8 years 62%; the failure-free survival at 8 years was 52%. the follow-up for macop-b is 39 to 106 months (median 76) for living patients. a multivariate prognostic factor analysis for this group of patients identified age greater than 60 years. b symptoms, more than one extranodal site of disease, and more than three nodal sites of disease as the four significant prognostic variables. from june 1986, 108 patients were enrolled on a modification of macop-b called vacop-b (etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone/bleomycin ). their cr rate was 81%, and the toxic death rate was lower, at 3%. the 60% overall survival at 3 years is not statistically significantly different from that of macop-b. the incidence of moderate or severe mucositis and cushingoid changes was much lower with vacop-b. the mopp/abv (mechlorethamine/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone- doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine) hybrid chemotherapy regimen for advanced-stage hodgkin's disease was standard therapy from april 1981 to june 1988 for untreated patients aged 16 to 65. advanced stage was defined as stages iib, iiib, iii2a, iva, ivb, or stages iia or iiia with greater than four splenic nodules or a mediastinal mass greater than one third of the transthoracic diameter.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
salmonella on pig carcasses: positive pigs and cross contamination in the slaughterhouse swine slaughter is an open process with many opportunities for the contamination of the pork carcass with potentially pathogenic bacteria; however, it does not contain any point where hazards are completely eliminated. data on the prevalence of various pathogenic bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter coli/jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica) in pigs, their growth and survival characteristics and ability to become established on the slaughter line are presented. the presentation covers the processing steps from lairage to chilling and is based on swine slaughter practices in denmark, norway and sweden. the major contamination points during swine slaughter are pig-related, such as faecal and pharyngeal, and environmental. haccp (hazard analysis critical control point) and gmp (good manufacturing practice) in swine slaughter must be focused on limiting this spread. the pathogenic bacteria show differences in their general mechanism of distribution. the major contamination source of campylobacter spp., salmonella spp. and y. enterocolitica is the pig, and the contamination of carcasses with these bacteria may be limited, provided that only strict slaughtering procedures are used. other organisms such as aeromonas spp., l. moncytogenes/listeria spp. and s. aureus can be endemic in the processing environment. since endemic bacteria can be controlled by proper cleaning and disinfection, these organisms are useful as indicators for the success of gmp rules. the following affiliation to cps or ccps made for specific steps during slaughter and dressing may serve as a guidance: (i) lairage (cp), (ii) killing (cp), (iii) scalding (cp), (iv) dehairing (cp), (v) singeing/flaming (cp), (vi) polishing (cp), (vii) circumanal incision and removal of the intestines (ccp), (viii) excision of the tongue, pharynx, and in particular the tonsils (ccp), (ix) splitting (cp), (x) post mortem inspection procedures (ccp) and (xi) deboning of the head (ccp).
the effect of evening primrose oil for the prevention of xerotic cheilitis in acne patients being treated with isotretinoin: a pilot study fats are prevalent in western diets; they have known deleterious effects on muscle insulin resistance and may contribute to bone loss. however, relationships between fatty acids and locomotor system dysfunctions in elderly population remain controversial. the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of fatty acid quality on the age related evolution of the locomotor system and to understand which aging mechanisms are involved. in order to analyze age related complications, the samp8 mouse strain was chosen as a progeria model as compared to the samr1 control strain. then, two months old mice were divided in different groups and subjected to the following diets : (1) standard "growth" diet - (2) "sunflower" diet (high ω6/ω3 ratio) - (3) "borage" diet (high γ-linolenic acid) - (4) "fish" diet (high in long chain ω3). mice were fed ad libitum through the whole protocol. at 12 months old, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were harvested for bone studies, fat and muscle mass measures, inflammation parameters and bone cell marker expression. we demonstrated for the first time that borage and fish diets restored inflammation and bone parameters using an original model of senile osteoporosis that mimics clinical features of aging in humans. therefore, our study strongly encourages nutritional approaches as relevant and promising strategies for preventing aged-related locomotor dysfunctions.
head group-independent interaction of phospholipids with bile salts. a fluorescence and epr study. using complementary physical-chemical methods including turbidimetry, quasielastic light scattering, gel filtration, and phase analysis, we examined the interactions between dilute concentrations of the common bile salt, taurochenodeoxycholate (tcdc), and uni- and multilamellar vesicles (mlvs) composed of defined molecular species of lecithin (l) and varying contents of cholesterol (ch). dissolution rates of mlvs with micellar tcdc, as assessed by turbidimetry, were more rapid with vesicles composed of sn-1 palmitoyl species, typical of biliary l, compared with those composed of the more hydrophobic sn-1 stearoyl species. incorporation of ch retarded mlv dissolution rates in proportion to the ch content, and only at high ch contents were dissolution rates appreciably influenced by the sn-2 fatty acid composition of l. when mlvs contained ch in amounts characteristic of intracellular membranes (ch/l approximately 0.1), the dissolution rates of the individual l species by tcdc accurately predicted the steady state l composition of human bile. tcdc interacted with small unilamellar l/ch vesicles (suvs) at concentrations well below, as well as appreciably above, its critical micellar concentration. in accordance with the tcdc-egg yolk l-h2o phase diagram, perimicellar concentrations of tcdc interacted with suvs to form aggregates that were approximately twice the size of the suvs. these were consistent with the formation of a dispersed hexagonal (rod-like) phase, which co-existed with aqueous bile salt (bs) monomers and either micellar or unilamellar suv phases. micellar tcdc completely solubilized suvs as mixed micelles, putatively via this transient hexagonal phase. with modest ch-supersaturation, dissolution was followed by the reemergence of a new vesicle population that coexisted metastably with mixed micelles. with high ch supersaturation, tcdc extracted l and ch molecules from suvs in different proportions to form ch-supersaturated mixed micelles and ch-enriched suvs, in accordance with the metastable phase diagram. these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that sn-1 palmitoyl l species are subselected for bile, in part, by physical-chemical interactions of intracellular bs concentrations with ch-poor membranes and that the subsequent evolution of ch-rich vesicles and ch-saturated mixed micelles occurs via a transitional hexagonal (rod) phase. these liquid-crystalline states are likely to be transient in ch-unsaturated biles, but may persist in ch-supersaturated human biles because of their high ch contents which retard or inhibit these phase transitions.
effect of k-252a and abscisic acid on the efflux of citrate from soybean roots. in many plants, efflux of organic anions from roots has been proposed as one of the major al resistance mechanisms. however it remains unknown how plants regulate efflux of organic anions in response to al. in this study, the regulatory mechanisms of al-responsive malate efflux in wheat (triticum aestivum) were characterized focusing on the role of protein phosphorylation. al-resistant wheat (cv atlas) initiated malate efflux at 5 min after addition of al, and this response was sensitive to temperature. k-252a, a broad range inhibitor of protein kinases, effectively blocked the al-induced malate efflux accompanied with an increased accumulation of al and intensified al-induced root growth inhibition. a transient activation of a 48-kd protein kinase and an irreversible repression of a 42-kd protein kinase were observed preceding the initiation of malate efflux, and these changes were canceled by k-252a. malate efflux was accompanied with a rapid decrease in the contents of organic anions in the root apex, such as citrate, succinate, and malate but with no change in the contents of inorganic anions such as chloride, nitrate, and phosphate. these results suggest that protein phosphorylation is involved in the al-responsive malate efflux in the wheat root apex and that the organic anion-specific channel might be a terminal target that responds to al signaling mediated by phosphorylation.
the two-component adjuvant ic31® boosts type i interferon production of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells via ligation of endosomal tlrs plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) are unique with respect to their capacity to produce unsurpassed amounts of ifn-α and coexpress tlr7 and tlr9, mediating ifn-α production. although tlrs are critical receptors of innate immunity, little is known about the immunological effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation. we have analyzed the effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation on ifn-α production by leukocytes and pdcs. our experiments revealed that both synthetic (resiquimod and loxoribine) and natural (ssrna40) tlr7 ligands abrogate cpg-a- and cpg-c-oligodeoxynucleotide (odn)-induced ifn-α production by human leukocytes. because tlr7 ligands themselves represent important ifn-α inducers, we demonstrated that substimulatory tlr7 ligand concentrations significantly inhibited cpg-a-induced ifn-α. delayed addition of tlr7 ligands still resulted in complete suppression of cpg-a-odn-induced ifn-α production, suggesting that the inhibition is unlikely to be caused by a kinetic uptake advantage. unlike for cpg-a and cpg-c, tlr7 ligands did not inhibit cpg-b-odn-induced ifn-α production. experiments with purified human pdcs demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation were mediated directly by pdcs. suppression of ifn-α production was not related to increased cell death and was also detectable in enriched mouse pdcs. analyses of pdcs suggested that the tlr7 signal regulates the outcome of tlr7 ligand/cpg-a-odn costimulation and can either inhibit (ifn-α) or promote (il-8/cd40) cytokine and surface marker expression. our data reveal for the first time a strong inhibitory effect of tlr7 stimulation on ifn-α production induced by cpg-a- and cpg-c-odns. these findings provide novel insight into the effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation and may support the development of novel tlr9 inhibitors.
the production of determiners: evidence from french in five picture-word interference experiments we explore the gender congruity effect observed in dutch in two languages, spanish and catalan. participants' performance was not affected by the relationship between the gender of the picture and the gender of the word. the results show that the gender congruity effect is not a universal effect, but varies from language to language, depending on crucial characteristics of the gender/determiner selection system used to process a given language. consistent with the crosslinguistic hypothesis presented by miozzo and caramazza we argue that the retrieval of the noun's gender is enough to specify the determiner's phonological form in dutch, but not in catalan or spanish, and this is the cause of the failure to replicate the dutch results in these two languages.
comparison between skeletal, and facial measurements of vertical dimension in edentulous patients in a group of nine dentate students with a mean age of 23.1 years, a comparison of their interocclusal distances was determined using tooth and chin reference points. this determination was made with two reference leds, one attached to a lower tooth and the other attached to a point on the chin. these two leds were registered simultaneously using the selspot system and analyzed with the use of a computer. three different methods were used to establish the interocclusal distance: a phonetic method, a relaxation method, and a swallowing method. independent of the method selected, there was a greater interocclusal distance recorded by the tooth-attached reference led. this study indicates that, in the clinical determination of interocclusal distance, where a chin reference is used the dentist should be aware of this difference--especially when lip activity is involved.
a comparative study with rosuvastatin in subjects with metabolic syndrome: results of the comets study. emerging data suggest that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg-coa) reductase inhibitors (statins) offer important benefits for the large population of individuals at high risk for coronary heart disease. this population encompasses a sizable portion of individuals who are also at high risk for drug-drug interactions due to their need for multiple medications. in general, statins are associated with a very small risk for myopathy (which may progress to fatal or nonfatal rhabdomyolysis); however, the potential for drug-drug interactions is known to increase this risk in specific high-risk groups. the incidence of myopathy associated with statin therapy is dose related and is increased when statins are used in combination with agents that share common metabolic pathways. of particular concern is the potential for interactions with other lipid-lowering agents such as fibrates and niacin (nicotinic acid), which may be used in patients with mixed lipidemia, and with immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine, which are commonly used in patients after transplantation. clinicians should be alert to the potential for drug-drug interactions to minimize the risk of myopathy during long-term statin therapy in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease.
hmga2 is a direct target gene of runx1 and regulates expansion of myeloid progenitors in mice. we present model-based analysis of chip-seq data, macs, which analyzes data generated by short read sequencers such as solexa's genome analyzer. macs empirically models the shift size of chip-seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. macs also uses a dynamic poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome, allowing for more robust predictions. macs compares favorably to existing chip-seq peak-finding algorithms, and is freely available.
herpes zoster by reactivated vaccine varicella zoster virus in a healthy child background the oka strain of live attenuated varicella vaccine is immunogenic and highly protective, but there has been concern about the risk of zoster after immunization.   methods we examined the incidence of zoster, risk factors for it, and measures of immune response in children with leukemia who received the vaccine and in appropriate controls.   results after a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, zoster was documented in 13 of the 548 vaccinated children with leukemia (2.4 percent). in a subgroup of 96 vaccinated children matched prospectively with 96 children with leukemia who had had natural varicella infections, there were 4 cases of zoster among the vaccinated children and 15 among the controls, for crude incidence rates of 0.80 and 2.46 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (p = 0.01). of the total of 13 vaccinated children who had zoster, 11 had a skin rash due to varicella-zoster virus, either from the vaccine itself or from breakthrough varicella after household exposure in the period between immunization and the documentation of zoster. in the 268 children who had any type of rash caused by varicella-zoster virus after vaccination, as compared with those who did not have a rash, the relative risk of subsequent zoster was 5.75. for the 21 vaccinated children who received bone marrow transplants, as compared with those who did not, the relative risk of zoster was 7.5. cell-mediated immunity as assessed by lymphocyte stimulation was lower in 4 children in whom zoster later developed than in 29 controls who had been vaccinated but who did not have zoster (mean stimulation index, 5.1 vs. 23.8; p = 0.0001).   conclusions in children with leukemia who receive the live attenuated varicella vaccine, the subsequent incidence of zoster is lower than in children who have natural varicella infections.
in vitro vla-4 blockade results in an impaired nk cell-mediated immune surveillance against melanoma. background natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against α₄ integrin used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms). four cases of melanomas occurring in patients prescribed natalizumab to treat ms were recently reported. although some fundamental data suggested that α₄β1 integrin could be linked to the invasiveness of melanoma, none showed any relation with the transformation of melanocytes.   observations we performed a prospective follow-up of a cohort of patients with ms treated with natalizumab to assess the evolution of nevi under treatment. clinical dermatologic examination and videodermoscopy were performed every 6 months. nevi were compared side-by-side with baseline photographs, and histologic analysis was proposed based on clinical and dermoscopic criteria. forty-four patients were included, and 248 nevi were examined and followed up. the mean duration of follow-up was 14 months (range, 6-20 months). seventeen lesions (6.8%) showed modifications over time. only 12 (4.8%) presented substantial dermoscopic changes. five lesions were removed. all of them were classified as benign after histologic examination.   conclusions our results showed the same rate of clinical and dermoscopic changes of nevi during treatment with natalizumab compared with the spontaneous evolution of nevi reported in literature. in accordance with fundamental data, those results suggest that the inhibition of the α₄ integrin does not promote the transformation of melanocytic lesions.
toward eliminating catheter-associated urinary tract infections in an academic health center. background and objectives: it is common practice to catheterize the bladder in the presence of epidural analgesia and to leave the bladder catheter in situ to avoid postoperative urinary retention. however, bladder catheterization carries the risk for urinary tract infection (uti). the objective of this randomized control trial was to assess whether the incidence of uti will differ among patients receiving standard care and patients who have the bladder catheterization discontinued on the morning after surgery with the epidural still functioning. methods: patients at low risk for postoperative urinary retention, scheduled for thoracic and abdominal surgery and receiving continuous thoracic epidural analgesia, were randomized on the morning after surgery to 2 groups: in the early removal group (n = 105), the bladder catheter was removed on the same morning after surgery, whereas in the standard group (sg) (n = 110), the bladder catheter was removed when epidural analgesia was discontinued (3-5 days). urinary bladder volume was assessed by ultrasound. primary and secondary outcomes were the incidence of uti and rate of recatheterization. results: two hundred fifteen patients were randomized. there were 17 uti cases in total, with 15 (14%) in the sg and 2 (2%) in the early removal group (p = 0.004). the incidence of recatheterizations was not different between the 2 groups (p = 0.09) and did not correlate with the site of epidural insertion. when matched for the types of surgery, the duration of hospital stay was longer in the patients who contracted uti (p = 0.004). there were more patients older than 65 years in the sg. conclusions: leaving the bladder catheter as long as the epidural analgesia is maintained results in a higher incidence of uti and prolonged hospital stay. removal of the bladder catheter on the morning after surgery does not lead to higher rate of catheterizations.
mental health problems among conflict-affected adults in grozny, chechnya: a qualitative study historically, organized violence has been a chronic pervasive problem in haiti. we set out to elicit haitians’ views on its effects to guide the development of interventions. in march 2006 we studied a population in the slum area of cap-haitien, haiti’s second largest city, and the nearby towns of milot and limbe. a convenience sample of adults was asked to free list all current problems affecting victims of organized violence. two major categories emerged: psychological problems and financial problems. the psychological problems of “feeling startled and loss of self control,” “sadness/grief,” “continuing to suffer from reliving/reexperiencing past events,” “problems in the head/mental problems,” “deep suffering in the heart,” and “thinking too much” emerged as themes from key-informant interviews. these may correspond to constructs of depression, dysthymia, and anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder in psychiatric nosology. the development of effective interventions can therefore consider those known to be effective for these problems in other settings. however in selecting interventions, considerations must also include local acceptability, perceived causes of problems, and their social effects.
polychaete richness and abundance enhanced in anthropogenically modified estuaries despite high concentrations of toxic contaminants we examine macrofaunal and physico-chemical responses to organic enrichment beneath salmon farms in contrasting flow environments, and reveal pronounced flow-related differences in the magnitude and spatial extent of effects. total macrofaunal abundances at high flow sites were nearly an order of magnitude greater than at comparable low flow sites, representing a significant benthic biomass. these very high abundances occurred in conjunction with moderate-to-high species richness, and were evident in the absence of appreciable organic matter accumulation. biological responses to increasing sulfide were variable; however a significant biological threshold was evident at 1500 μm. macrofaunal responses at high flow sites differed substantially from the pearson-rosenberg model. the atypical ecological conditions were attributed to (i) limited accumulation of fine sediments, (ii) maintenance of aerobic conditions in near-surface sediments, and (iii) an abundant food supply. thus, enhanced resilience to organic waste at well-flushed sites appears related to both biological and physical processes.
activation of risk and safe pathways is not involved in the effects of cx43 deficiency on tolerance to ischemia–reperfusion injury and preconditioning protection activation of several protein kinases occurs during myocardial ischaemia and during subsequent reperfusion. in contrast to the intensive investigation into the significance of kinase activation in cardioprotection, relatively little is known about the role of the phosphatases in this regard. the aim of this study was to re-evaluate the putative roles of pp1 and pp2a in ischaemia/reperfusion and in triggering ischaemic preconditioning. isolated perfused working rat hearts were subjected to sustained global (15 or 20 min) or regional ischaemia (35 min), followed by reperfusion. hearts were preconditioned using global ischaemia (1 × 5 or 3 × 5 min, alternated with 5 min reperfusion). to inhibit both pp1 and pp2a cantharidin (5 μm) was used. to inhibit pp2a only, okadaic acid (7.5 nm) was used. the drugs were administered during the preconditioning protocol, before onset of sustained ischaemia (pretreatment) or during reperfusion. endpoints were mechanical recovery during reperfusion, infarct size and activation of pkb/akt, p38 mapk and erk p42/p44, as determined by western blot. pretreatment of hearts with okadaic acid or cantharidin caused a significant reduction in mechanical recovery after 15 or 20 min global ischaemia. administration of the drugs during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol abolished functional recovery during reperfusion and significantly increased infarct size. administration of the drugs during reperfusion had no deleterious effects and increased functional recovery in 3 × pc hearts. to find an explanation for the differential effects of the inhibitors depending on the time of administration, hearts were freeze-clamped at different time points during the perfusion protocol. administration of cantharidin before 5 min ischaemia activated all kinases. subsequent reperfusion for 5 min without the drug maintained activation of the kinases until the onset of sustained ischaemia. cantharidin given during preconditioning was associated with activation of p38mapk and pkb/akt during reperfusion after sustained ischaemia. however, administration of the drug during reperfusion only after sustained ischaemia caused activation of both pkb/akt and erk p42/p44. phosphatase inhibition immediately prior to the onset of sustained ischaemia or during preconditioning abolishes protection during reperfusion, while inhibition of these enzymes during reperfusion either had no effect or enhanced the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. it is proposed that inhibition of phosphatases during reperfusion may prolong the period of risk activation and hence protect the heart.
inhibition of unfolding and aggregation of lens protein human gamma d crystallin by sodium citrate. data are reported for tm, the temperature midpoint of the thermal unfolding curve, of ribonuclease a, versus ph (range 2–9) and salt concentration (range 0–1 m) for two salts, na2so4 and nacl. the results show stabilization by sulfate via anion‐specific binding in the concentration range 0–0.1 m and via the hofmeister effect in the concentration range 0.1–1.0 m. the increase in tm caused by anion binding at 0.1 m sulfate is 20° at ph 2 but only 1° at ph 9, where the net proton charge on the protein is near 0. the 10° increase in tm between 0.1 and 1.0 m na2so4, caused by the hofmeister effect, is independent of ph. a striking property of the nacl results is the absence of any significant stabilization by 0.1 m nacl, which indicates that any debye screening is small. ph‐dependent stabilization is produced by 1 m nacl: the increase in tm between 0 and 1.0 m is 14° at ph 2 but only 1° at ph 9. the 14° increase at ph 2 may result from anion binding or from both binding and debye screening. taken together, the results for na2so4 and nacl show that native ribonuclease a is stabilized at low ph in the same manner as molten globule forms of cytochrome c and apomyoglobin, which are stabilized at low ph by low concentrations of sulfate but only by high concentrations of chloride.
paralympic athletes with cerebral palsy display altered pacing strategies in distance‐deceived shuttle running trials the studies of amann et al. (2006, 2007) conclude that feedback from fatiguing skeletal muscle during exercise at different reduces central motor output to the working muscles “in order to reinvent excessive development of peripheral muscle fatigue beyond a critical threshold or sensory tolerance limit” (amann et al. 2006, p. 950). we suggest that their findings can be better explained by hypoxia-induced changes in central motor output acting in an anticipatory manner.
infantile anorexia and co-parenting: a pilot study on mother–father–child triadic interactions during feeding and play objective the aim of this study was to examine the differences among three subtypes of feeding disorders (fd), defined through the criteria of the dc:0-3r: "infantile anorexia" (ia), "feeding disorder associated with insults to the gastrointestinal tract" (fdigt), and "sensory food aversions" (sfa), by exploring mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes.   method the sample consisted of 146 italian mother-child pairs, of which 51 children with ia, 47 children with fdigt, and 48 mothers and their children with sfa. all dyads were videotaped during feeding; mothers completed questionnaires assessing their psychological profiles and eating attitudes, as well as their children's temperament and emotional/behavioral functioning.   results analyses revealed significant differences between the diagnostic groups of fd in relation to mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes.   discussion both interactional and individual variables may contribute differently to specific fd and outcomes during childhood. definitions by fd subtypes, using operational diagnostic criteria, and the assessment of mother-child interactions are relevant to target interventions strategies to treat specific disorders.
high responsivity to threat during the initial stage of perception in repression: a 3 t fmri study. this research project posits a model of repression that incorporates both repressive personality and repressive social behavior. the 1st parameter of the model specifies the motivation for repressors' distancing of themselves from emotional events. experiment 1 demonstrates that repressors are hypersensitive--in their cognitive attention--to both negative and positive emotional events. the 2nd parameter of the model specifies the conditions under which repressors distance themselves from emotional events. experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that repressors psychologically distance themselves when the situation threatens their self-evaluation and provides opportunity for them to attend to and process self-relevant and non-self-relevant information. this 2-factor model extends the current conceptualization of repression in that it identifies motivation (dispositional emotional sensitivity) and context (situational threats to self-evaluation and distraction availability) for repressors' distancing of themselves from negative and positive emotional events.
a tract-based spatial statistics study in anorexia nervosa: abnormality in the fornix and the cerebellum the eating disorder anorexia nervosa (an) is associated with high anxiety. the brain mechanisms that drive those behaviors are unknown. in this study we wanted to test whether brain white matter (wm) integrity is altered in an, and related to heightened anxiety. sixteen adult women with an (mean age 24 ± 7 years) and 17 healthy control women (cw, mean age 25 ± 4 years) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (dti) of the brain. the dti brain images were used to calculate the fractional anisotropy (fa) of wm tracts, which is a measure for wm integrity. an individuals compared to cw showed clusters of significantly reduced fa (p<0.05, corrected) in the bilateral fimbria-fornix and the fronto-occipital fasciculus, as well as the posterior cingulum wm. in the an group, harm avoidance was predicted by fa in the left and right fimbria-fornix. those findings were not due to wm volume deficits in an. this study indicates that wm integrity is abnormal in an in limbic and association pathways, which could contribute to disturbed feeding, emotion processing and body perception in an. the prediction of harm avoidance in an by fimbria-fornix wm integrity suggests that this pathway may be mechanistically involved in high anxiety in an.
distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) protein and mrna in the normal adult rat cns: evidence for anterograde axonal transport the site and regulation of neurotrophic factor release from neurons is poorly understood. we used a combination of model cell lines and primary culture systems to study the polarity of bdnf sorting and the regulation of its release from hippocampal neurons. transfection and expression of a human bdnf cdna in a mouse pituitary cell line, att20, resulted in the colocalization of bdnf with the secretory granule marker, chromogranin a. furthermore, stimulation of these cells with 56 mm kcl or with 5 mm 8-bromo-camp increased the release of bdnf approximately 10-to 15-fold within 30 min. to study bdnf release from primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, cells were infected with a defective herpes simplex viral (hsv) vector expressing human bdnf. depolarizing conditions increased the release of bdnf 5-fold from these cells, further verifying that secretion is regulated. immunocytochemical analysis using highly specific antibodies determined that endogenous bdnf was predominantly localized to the somatodentritic domain of hippocampal neurons. these findings support the view that bdnf functions as a target-derived signal for afferents to hippocampal pyramidal cells and that it may serve as a regulator of hippocampal plasticity.
[relationship between cigarette smoking and the carbon monoxide concentration in the exhaled breath with perioperative respiratory complications]. objective to determine the impact of smoking on the rate of pulmonary and upper respiratory complications following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.   methods we retrospectively identified all patients who underwent laparoscopic gynecologic surgery at one institution between january 2000 and january 2009. pulmonary and upper respiratory complications were defined as atelectasis, pneumonia, upper respiratory infection, acute respiratory failure, hypoxemia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum occurring within 30 days after surgery   results nine hundred three patients underwent attempt at laparoscopic surgery. fifty-four were excluded because of conversion to laparotomy and 31 because of insufficient data. of the 818 patients included, 356 (43%) had cancer. a total of 576 (70%) patients were never smokers, 156 (19%) were past smokers, and 86 (10%) were current smokers (smoked within 6 weeks before surgery). these three groups were similar with regard to median body mass index, operative time, and length of hospital stay. compared to never and past smokers, current smokers were more likely to undergo high-complexity laparoscopic procedures (10.4%, 15.4%, and 19.8%, respectively; p=0.015) and had younger median age 49 years, 51 years, and 46 years, respectively; p=0.035. nineteen (2.3%) patients experienced pulmonary complications - symptomatic atelectasis (n=9), pneumonia (n=5), acute respiratory failure (n=2), hypoxemia (n=1), pneumomediastinum (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=2). the rate of pulmonary complications was 2.1% (12 of 564 patients) in never smokers, 4.5% (7 of 156 patients) in past smokers, and zero in current smokers.   conclusion in this cohort, smoking history did not appear to impact postoperative pulmonary and upper respiratory complications. in smokers scheduled for operative procedures, laparoscopy should be considered when feasible.
is there any relationship between medication compliance and affective temperaments in patients with type 2 diabetes? background in non-diabetic populations, anxious and depressive affective temperaments are associated with stress and distress disorders (anxious and depressive). in type 2 diabetes, distress with diabetes and distress disorders have been associated with metabolic control. there are few studies undertaken on temperament and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. the aim of our study was to examine the independent association between affective temperaments and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.   methods the sample included 90 patients with type 2 diabetes from two outpatient clinics aged 53.54 (sd ± 8.05) years and with 66.7% female gender. depression was evaluated by using the madrs observer rating scale (mean value: 16.38 ± 11).   results patients with excessive depressive and anxious temperaments had more depressive symptoms, worse psychological adjustment to diabetes and worse metabolic control. in logistic regression (crude model), only depressive temperament was independently associated with metabolic control.   conclusions affective temperaments are associated with psychological adjustment to diabetes and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. patients above threshold on depressive temperament should be considered for greater scrutiny and psycho-education by the diabetes clinic staff.
improved treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis with fluconazole plus probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr‐1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc‐14 vulvovaginal candidasis (vvc) is a common disease. the majority of cases is caused by candida albicans, but in recent years an increase has been observed in the frequency of non‐albicans candida infections, especially due to c. glabrata and c. tropicalis. the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of non‐albicans candida infections in patients suffering from vvc. therefore, the statistical data of culture‐confirmed vvc ascertained at the institute of hygiene (medical university graz) have been studied. altogether, 10 463 samples from patients with vulvovaginal complaints were analysed in the years 2000–2004, a number of 3184 proved to be culture‐positive for yeast. candida albicans was the most prevalent cause in 87.9% of all cases. non‐albicans candida yeast were detected in 12.1%, mainly c. glabrata and saccharomyces cerevisiae. during a 1‐year period 185 patients showed more than one episode of vvc. patients aged 21–40 years were significantly more prone to suffer from vvc compared with other age‐related groups.
cortical speech-evoked response patterns in multiple auditory fields are correlated with behavioral discrimination ability. the rat auditory cortex is divided anatomically into several areas, but little is known about the functional differences in information processing between these areas. to determine the filter properties of rat posterior auditory field (paf) neurons, we compared neurophysiological responses to simple tones, frequency modulated (fm) sweeps, and amplitude modulated noise and tones with responses of primary auditory cortex (a1) neurons. paf neurons have excitatory receptive fields that are on average 65% broader than a1 neurons. the broader receptive fields of paf neurons result in responses to narrow and broadband inputs that are stronger than a1. in contrast to a1, we found little evidence for an orderly topographic gradient in paf based on frequency. these neurons exhibit latencies that are twice as long as a1. in response to modulated tones and noise, paf neurons adapt to repeated stimuli at significantly slower rates. unlike a1, neurons in paf rarely exhibit facilitation to rapidly repeated sounds. neurons in paf do not exhibit strong selectivity for rate or direction of narrowband one octave fm sweeps. these results indicate that paf, like nonprimary visual fields, processes sensory information on larger spectral and longer temporal scales than primary cortex.
childhood dysglycemia: prevalence and outcome in a referral hospital transient hyperglycemia occurs as a part of stress response in acute illnesses and is brought about by elevated levels of counter regulatory hormones. it is frequently encountered but the exact prevalence and implications, especially in childhood have not been studied in detail. 758 children (1 month to 6 years) with acute illness were screened for hyperglycemia; of these 36 children were found to have a glucose level of ≥150 mg/dl at admission and were designated hyperglycemics. the overall prevalence of hyperglycemia was 4.7 per cent. the disease-wise prevalence in neurological disorders, septicemia, respiratory illnesses and diarrhoea was 7.9, 7.6, 4.2 and 3.0 per cent respectively. family history of diabetes did not predispose towards developing transient hyperglycemia. the demographic profile (age, sex, nutrition status and disease pattern) and severity of illness (as assessed by temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, duration of illness and hospitalization, treatment modalities required, hypoxia and acidosis) did not affect the prevalence, extent and the rate of normalization of hyperglycemia. the mortality in hyperglycemics was double (13.9%) as compared to 6.9% in non-hyperglycemics, although the difference was insignificant, statistically (o.r=2.17, ci=0.81–5.82, p>0.05). it was, therefore, concluded that transient hyperglycemia occurs in 4–5% of patients with acute pediatric illnesses. however, it does not significantly correlate with the clinical profile and severity of the illness, and has no immediate prognostic significance.

oxytocin increases autonomic cardiac control: moderation by loneliness background in nonhuman mammals, the neuropeptide oxytocin has repeatedly been shown to increase social approach behavior and pair bonding. in particular, central nervous oxytocin reduces behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to social stress and is suggested to mediate the rewarding aspects of attachment in highly social species. however, to date there have been no studies investigating the effects of central oxytocin mechanisms on behavior and physiology in human couple interaction.   methods in a double-blind placebo-controlled design, 47 heterosexual couples (total n = 94) received oxytocin or placebo intranasally before a standard instructed couple conflict discussion in the laboratory. the conflict session was videotaped and coded for verbal and nonverbal interaction behavior (e.g., eye contact, nonverbal positive behavior, and self-disclosure). salivary cortisol was repeatedly measured during the experiment.   results oxytocin significantly increased positive communication behavior in relation to negative behavior during the couple conflict discussion (f = 4.18, p = .047) and significantly reduced salivary cortisol levels after the conflict compared with placebo (f = 7.14, p = .011).   conclusions these results are in line with animal studies indicating that central oxytocin facilitates approach and pair bonding behavior. our findings imply an involvement of oxytocin in couple interaction and close relationships in humans.
