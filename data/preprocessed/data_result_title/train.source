radiation-induced tumors of the central nervous system occurring in childhood and adolescence four unusual lesions in three patients and a review of the literature this is the second follow-up study of 2,215 persons who during childhood between 1940 and 1959 had been given x-ray therapy for tinea capitis and of 1,395 persons well matched for age, sex, and race who were treated for the same disease during the same period without the use of x-ray therapy. the major finding of the study was an excess incidence in the irradiated cases of tumors of the head and neck including the skin, brain, thyroid, and parotid. however, between the groups there was no difference in death due to malignant neoplasms or any other cause. among white patients, a 40% excess of treated psychiatric disorders was observed in the irradiated group, but there was no difference among blacks.
toxinotyping of necrotic enteritis-producing and commensal isolates of clostridium perfringens from chickens fed organic diets abstract necrotic enteritis is an enteric disease of avian species caused by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium perfringens. the disease is regularly controlled in the broiler chicken industry with antimicrobials in feed but is reemerging in areas such as europe where there is a ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters. to study prospective therapies, researchers must be able to reproduce this disease in a controlled environment, but this is not always possible because of differences in the pathogenicity of c. perfringens strains. our objective was to test the potential of five isolates (snecp43, 44, 47, 49, and 50), taken from field cases of necrotic enteritis, at recreating the disease in a controlled challenge experiment. snecp43 and 50 were derived from a common clone, with snecp50 passed in vivo and snecp43 subcultured in vitro. four hundred birds were divided into 16 pens, with three pens each receiving one of five treatments, with one control pen. day-old birds were raised on a high wheat-based diet to promote necrotic enteritis development and were challenged with between 3.4 × 109 and 3.2 × 1011 colony-forming units (cfu) of c. perfringens in feed for a period of 24 hr starting on day 13 of the challenge experiment. lesion scores were assessed on two birds per pen sacrificed on day 17 and on any dead birds during the 25-day study. growth performance was assessed up to 25 days, and mortality recorded throughout. only snecp50 produced necrotic enteritis mortalities significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from the control. the five isolates were also typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to assess their genetic relatedness. all epidemiologically unrelated isolates were deemed genetically unrelated, whereas snecp43 and 50 differed by only a single minor band. toxin type was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr), which was also used for the detection of the gene encoding the β2-toxin.
visual concerns that interfere with daily activities in patients on rehabilitation units: a descriptive study in a prospective study, we assessed the prevalence and significance of visual and hearing impairment in 896 patients who were hospitalized for rehabilitation following hip fracture. visual impairment was defined as visual acuity equal to worse than 6/60 in the better of the two eyes. hearing impairment was defined as mean decibel level equal to or higher than 60 in the better of the two ears. visual impairment was found in 210 patients (23.4%) and hearing impairment was found in 231 patients (25.8%). simultaneous visual and hearing impairment was seen in 72 patients (8%). in univariate analysis, the absolute efficacy of rehabilitation was significantly lower in patients with visual impairment compared to those without (p = 0.00001) and in patients with hearing impairment compared to those without (p = 0.002). however, in multivariate analysis, visual, but not hearing, impairment was found to be independently associated with the absolute efficacy of rehabilitation (p = 0.001). in light of these results, we propose that in the first phase of rehabilitation, patients' visual acuity needs to be optimized.
synergistic antimicrobial interaction between honey and phage against escherichia coli biofilms the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa ubiquitously inhabits soil and water habitats and also causes serious, often antibiotic resistant, infections in immunocompromised patients (e.g. cystic fibrosis). this versatility is mediated in part by a large repertoire of two-component regulatory systems that appear instrumental in the regulation of both virulence processes and resistance to antimicrobials. major two-component regulatory system proteins demonstrated to regulate these diverse processes include phop–phoq, gaca–gacs, rets, lads, and algr, among others. here, we summarize the current body of knowledge of these and other two-component systems that provides insight into the complex regulation of virulence and resistance in p. aeruginosa.
surface ultrastructure and mechanical properties of three different white-coated niti archwires. previous mechanical testing of orthodontic wires has, in many cases, failed to simulate some key features of the clinical environment. the purpose of this study was to investigate the load-deflection characteristics of 7 different 0.016-in initial alignment archwires (twistflex, niti, and 5 brands of heat-activated superelastic nickel-titanium [hasn]) with modified bending tests simulating a number of conditions encountered clinically. load-deflection tests were carried out on the wires with 5 different model designs, and data from selected points on the unloading phase of the generated graphs were statistically analyzed. wire deflection was carried out at 3 temperatures (22.0 degrees c, 35.5 degrees c, and 44.0 degrees c) and to 4 deflection distances (1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm). rankings were derived according to statistically significant differences in each test situation. the effects of model, wire, and temperature variation were all statistically significant. twistflex and the 5 hasn wires produced a range of broadly comparable results, and niti gave the highest unloading values. model rankings indicated that self-ligating twin-lock brackets produced lower friction than regular edgewise brackets. the authors recommend using the rankings from the mechanical test simulations to predict possible clinical performance of archwires.
adaptation by a cochlear-implant patient to upward shifts in the frequency representation of speech the goal of the present study was to investigate the time course of adaptation by experienced cochlear implant users to a shifted frequency-to-electrode assignment in their speech processors. speech recognition performance of three nucleus-22 cochlear implant users was measured over a 3-month period, during which the implant listeners continuously wore "experimental" speech processors that were purposely shifted by 2-4 mm in terms of the frequency-to-electrode assignment relative to their normal processor. baseline speech performance was measured with each subject's clinically assigned speech processor just prior to implementation of the experimental processor. baseline speech performance was measured again after the 3-month test period, immediately following the reinstallation of the clinically assigned processor settings. speech performance with the experimental processor was measured four times during the first week, and weekly thereafter over the 3-month period. results showed that the experimental processor produced significantly lower performance on all measures of speech recognition immediately following implementation. over the 3-month test period, consonant and hint sentence recognition with the experimental processors gradually approached a performance level comparable to but still significantly below the baseline and postexperiment measures made with the clinically assigned processor. however, vowel and timit sentence recognition with the experimental processors remained far below the level of the baseline measures even at the end of the 3-month experimental period. there was no significant change in performance with the clinically assigned processor before or after fitting with the experimental processor. the results suggest that a long-time exposure to a new pattern of stimulation may not be able to compensate for the deficit in performance caused by a 2-4-mm shift in the tonotopic location of stimulation, at least within a 3-month period.
endodomain diversity in the drosophila dscam and its roles in neuronal morphogenesis besides 19,008 possible ectodomains, drosophila dscam contains two alternative transmembrane/juxtamembrane segments, respectively, derived from exon 17.1 and exon 17.2. we wondered whether specific dscam isoforms mediate formation and segregation of axonal branches in the drosophila mushroom bodies (mbs). removal of various subsets of the 12 exon 4s does not affect mb neuronal morphogenesis, while expression of a dscam transgene only partially rescues dscam mutant phenotypes. interestingly, differential rescuing effects are observed between two dscam transgenes that each possesses one of the two possible exon 17s. axon bifurcation/segregation abnormalities are better rescued by the exon 17.2-containing transgene, but coexpression of both transgenes is required for rescuing mutant viability. meanwhile, exon 17.1 targets ectopically expressed dscam-gfp to dendrites while dscam[exon 17.2]-gfp is enriched in axons; only dscam[exon 17.2] affects mb axons. these results suggest that exon 17.1 is minimally involved in axonal morphogenesis and that morphogenesis of mb axons probably involves multiple distinct exon 17.2-containing dscam isoforms.
intratumoural foxp3-positive regulatory t cells are associated with adverse prognosis in radically resected gastric cancer. regulatory t cells (tregs) are thought to affect the severity of various infectious and autoimmune diseases. the incidence of autoimmune disease is higher in fertile women than in men. thus, we investigated whether treg numbers were modulated during the menstrual cycle by sex hormones. in fertile nonpregnant women, we detected an expansion of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. this increase was tightly correlated with serum levels of estradiol and was followed by a dramatic decrease in treg numbers at the luteal phase. women who have had recurrent spontaneous abortions (rsa) showed similarly low numbers of tregs at both the follicular and luteal phases, comparable to numbers we observed in postmenopausal women. in addition to decreased numbers, tregs from women with rsa were also functionally deficient, as higher numbers were required to exert a similar magnitude of suppression to cd4+cd25+foxp3+ cells from fertile women. consequently, reproductive failure might result from the inability of tregs in women with rsa to expand during the preimplantatory phase combined with their lower functional capacity. additionally, the modulation of treg numbers we observed in fertile women suggests that the stage of the menstrual cycle should be taken into account when treg numbers are investigated clinically.
hyposalivation, xerostomia and oral health status of hiv-infected subjects in thailand before haart era. this investigation compared the salivary anticandidal activities of 12 healthy adults with 12 hospitalized patients with aids. stimulated parotid, submandibular-sublingual, and whole salivas were collected during a period of 10 min, immediately acidified, boiled, and then centrifuged to isolate salivary supernatants. supernatants were then tested for antifungal activity against candida albicans in blastospore viability inhibition and germ tube formation assays. a unit of blastospore or germ tube antifungal activity was established as that activity yielding 90% or greater inhibition during a defined time period in each salivary assay. each of the patients with aids were found to be defective in one or more of their salivary antifungal activities, and in comparison with healthy adults the differences in antifungal units per milliliter of saliva and total antifungal units were statistically significant for each saliva and each antifungal assay. defective salivary antifungal activity may contribute to the oral candidiasis seen in patients with aids.
olfactory bulb mitral-tufted cell plasticity: odorant-specific tuning reflects previous odorant exposure 1. recordings of extracellular spike responses were made from single mitral/tufted cells in the main olfactory bulb of urethan-anesthetized rabbits. olfactory epithelium ipsilateral to the recorded olfactory bulb was stimulated with homologous series of aliphatic compounds using periodic artificial inhalations. 2. in the dorsomedial part of the main olfactory bulb, single mitral/tufted cells were activated by subsets of n-fatty acids with similar hydrocarbon chain lengths. response selectivities of single mitral/tufted cells were examined in detail using a series of n-fatty acids at five different concentrations. the results indicate that although the range of effective fatty acids is broader at the higher concentrations, the best response at higher concentrations was similar to that determined at lower concentrations. 3. analysis of single-unit responses to the panel of fatty acids, including those with branched hydrocarbon chains, suggested that the determinants for the response specificities of individual mitral/tufted cells in the dorsomedial region include the overall size of hydrocarbon chains of the odor ligand molecules. 4. single mitral/tufted cells in the dorsomedial region tended to be activated not only by fatty acids but also by n-aliphatic aldehydes. for a panel of a homologous series of n-aldehydes at five different concentrations, individual mitral/tufted cells showed response selectivity to subsets of aldehydes with similar hydrocarbon chain lengths. 5. in most cases, normal aliphatic alcohols and alkanes were ineffective in activating mitral/tufted cells in the dorsomedial region. this suggests that carbonyl group (--c = o) in the odor molecules plays an important role in determining response specificity of these neurons. 6. examination with an expanded panel of stimulus odor molecules that included ketones and esters indicated that single mitral/tufted cells sensitive to subsets of fatty acids and n-aliphatic aldehydes were also responsive to subsets of ketones and/or esters having hydrocarbon chain lengths similar to those of the effective fatty acids and aldehydes. 7. the present results show a clear correlation between the tuning specificity of individual mitral/tufted cells and the stereochemical structure of the odor molecules, with respect to 1) length and/or structure of hydrocarbon chain, 2) difference in functional group, and 3) position of the functional group within the molecule. 8. a hypothetical diagram suggesting functional convergence of olfactory nerve input to individual glomeruli is proposed to explain the mechanism for selective activation of individual mitral/tufted cells by a range of odor molecules with similar stereochemical structures.
colorectal cancer screening coverage in greece. pacmer 02.01 study collaboration background several international guidelines have recommended the involvement of general practitioners (gps) in screening programs, but current evidence suggests this is very difficult. we implemented a survey to understand the attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding colorectal cancer screening of gps in the lazio region.   methods survey of all gps working in 13 of the 50 districts in lazio using a mail-in questionnaire.   results out of 1192 gps, 699 responded (59%). ninety-four percent consider crc a preventable disease. knowledge about oncological screenings is higher in gps using the guidelines as source of information. twenty-five percent properly recommend the available screening tests for colorectal cancer, 22% do not recommend any, 6% under-recommend, and 47% over-recommend. adequate knowledge of oncological screenings is positively associated with correct recommendation. thirty-two percent of gps recommend inappropriate follow-up tests for patients with positive fecal occult blood test.   conclusions the low response rate reveals the lack of gp's interest in screening. knowledge about screening and use of guidelines as sources of scientific information are important factors to improve attitudes about screening, but there is a large percentage of well-informed gps who do not recommend colorectal cancer screening at all. currently, many gps do not properly follow the patients up after a positive fobt.
rhcg is the major putative ammonia transporter expressed in the human kidney, and rhbg is not expressed at detectable levels mineralocorticoid hormones regulate salt transport along the distal nephron by binding to intracellular receptors and activating gene transcription. previous experiments showed that systemic aldosterone infusions stimulate thiazide-sensitive na and cl transport by distal convoluted tubule (dct) cells; this effect could have been direct or secondary to systemic hormonal effects. aldosterone target tissues express both mineralocorticoid receptors and the metabolic enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. mineralocorticoid receptors have been localized to the dct in some experiments, but not in others. expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 by dct cells has not been investigated. the present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that rat dct cells are targets of aldosterone action. patterns of mineralocorticoid receptor, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, thiazide-sensitive na-cl cotransporter, and na/ca exchanger expression along the distal tubule were examined. a polyclonal antibody was generated to localize the thiazide-sensitive na-cl cotransporter. thiazide-sensitive na-cl cotransporter and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression were examined using both in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry; na/ca exchanger and mineralocorticoid receptor expression were examined by immunocytochemistry. the results indicate that 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is expressed by dct cells, as well as connecting tubule cells and principal cells of the collecting duct; expression levels are low near the junction with the thick ascending limb and rise near the transition to the connecting tubule. mineralocorticoid receptors are expressed by dct cells, as well as along the thick ascending limb, connecting tubule, and collecting duct. the results indicate that components of the mineralocorticoid receptor system are expressed by dct cells, suggesting that these cells are targets of aldosterone action.
risk factors for development of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness after endotracheal intubation in women: a secondary analysis. background diffusion of nitrous oxide into the cuff of the endotracheal tube results in an increase in cuff pressure. excessive endotracheal tube cuff pressure may impair tracheal mucosal perfusion and cause tracheal damage and sore throat. filling the cuff of the endotracheal tube with saline instead of air prevents the increase in cuff pressure due to nitrous oxide diffusion. this method was used to test whether tracheal morbidity is related to excess in tracheal cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia. methods fifty patients with american society of anesthesiologists physical status i or ii were randomly allocated to two groups with endotracheal tube cuffs initially inflated to 20–30 cm h2o with either air (group a) or saline (group s). anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. at the time of extubation, a fiberoptic examination of the trachea was performed by an independent observer, and abnormalities of tracheal mucosa at the level of the cuff contact area were scored. patients assessed their symptoms (sore throat, dysphagia, and hoarseness) at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit and 24 h after extubation on a 101-point numerical rating scale. results cuff pressure increased gradually during anesthesia in group a but remained stable in group s. the incidence of sore throat was greater in group a than in group s in the postanesthesia care unit (76 vs. 20%) and 24 h after extubation (42 vs. 12%;p < 0.05). tracheal lesions at time of extubation were seen in all patients of group a and in eight patients (32%) of group s (p < 0.05). conclusion excess in endotracheal tube cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia due to nitrous oxide diffusion into this closed gas space causes sore throat that is related to tracheal mucosal erosion.
the relationship of antisocial personality disorder and history of conduct disorder with crime incidence in schizophrenia more than 15 years ago, findings from the epidemiological catchment area study indicated that antisocial personality disorder (apd) is more prevalent among persons with schizophrenia than in the general population. the present study analyzed data from a multisite investigation to examine the correlates of apd among 232 men with schizophrenic disorders, three-quarters of whom had committed at least one crime. comparisons of the men with and without apd revealed no differences in the course or symptomatology of schizophrenia. by contrast, multivariate models confirmed strong associations of comorbid apd with substance abuse, attention/concentration problems, and poor academic performance in childhood; and in adulthood with alcohol abuse or dependence and deficient affective experience (a personality style indexed by lack of remorse or guilt, shallow affect, lack of empathy, and failure to accept responsibility for one's own actions). at first admission, men with schizophrenia and apd presented a long history of antisocial behavior that included nonviolent offending and substance misuse, and an emotional dysfunction that is thought to increase the risk of violence toward others. specific treatments and management strategies are indicated.
artemisone uptake in plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes there is great need to identify and characterize drug targets and chemotherapeutic strategies against malaria. here we show that a vacuolar-network induced by the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, is a major import pathway for artemisinin, a leading, new anti-malarial that is known to be effective against drug resistant strains. we also show that artemisinin-treatment induces aberrant, budding of a vacuolar-network membrane protein and its antimalarial activity is additive with toxic sphingolipid analogues that block the network. the data suggest that artemisinin alters membrane protein export from the vacuolar-network and combinations with anti-network reagents have the potential to provide powerful new chemotherapy for drug resistant malaria.
down-regulation of volume-sensitive cl– channels by cftr is mediated by the second nucleotide-binding domain 1 to investigate whether the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) interacts with volume regulated anion channels (vracs), we measured the volume‐activated chloride current (icl,swell) using the whole‐cell patch‐clamp technique in calf pulmonary artery endothelial (cpae) cells and in cos cells transiently transfected with wild‐type (wt) cftr and the deletion mutant δf508 cftr. 2 i cl,swell was significantly reduced in cpae cells expressing wt cftr to 66.5 ± 8.8% (n= 13; mean ±s.e.m.) of the control value (n= 11). this reduction was independent of activation of the cftr channel. 3 expression of δf508 cftr resulted in two groups of cpae cells. in the first group ibmx and forskolin could activate a cl− current. in these cells icl,swell was reduced to 52.7 ± 18.8% (n= 5) of the control value (n= 21). in the second group ibmx and forskolin could not activate a current. the amplitude of icl,swell in these cells was not significantly different from the control value (112.4 ± 13.7%, n= 11; 21 control cells). 4 using the same method we showed that expression of wt cftr in cos cells reduced icl,swell to 62.1 ± 11.9% (n= 14) of the control value (n= 12) without any changes in the kinetics of the current. non‐stationary noise analysis suggested that there is no significant difference in the single channel conductance of vrac between cftr expressing and non‐expressing cos cells. 5 we conclude that expression of wt cftr down‐regulates icl,swell in cpae and cos cells, suggesting an interaction between cftr and vrac independent of activation of cftr.
decoding word and category-specific spatiotemporal representations from meg and eeg in a sentence reading task, words that occurred out of context were associated with specific types of event-related brain potentials. words that were physically aberrant (larger than normal) elecited a late positive series of potentials, whereas semantically inappropriate words elicited a late negative wave (n400). the n400 wave may be an electrophysiological sign of the "reprocessing" of semantically anomalous information.
novel association between plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 and risk of incident atrial fibrillation in a case-cohort study: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study objective—to evaluate if biomarkers reflecting left ventricular/vascular extracellular matrix remodeling are associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd) and death in the community. methods and results—in 922 framingham study participants (mean age, 58 years; 56% women), we related circulating concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (binary variable: detectable versus undetectable), log of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and log of procollagen type iii aminoterminal peptide (piiinp) to incident cvd and death. on follow-up (mean, 9.9 years), 51 deaths and 81 cvd events occurred. each sd increment of log of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and log-piiinp was associated with multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios of 1.72 (95% ci, 1.30 to 2.27) and 1.47 (95% ci, 1.11 to 1.96), respectively, for mortality risk. log-piiinp concentrations were also associated with cvd risk (hazard ratio [95% ci] per sd, 1.35 [1.05 to 1.74]). death and cvd incidence rates were 2-fold higher in participants with both biomarkers higher than the median (corresponding hazard ratio [95% ci], 2.78 [1.43 to 5.40] and 1.77 [1.04 to 3.03], respectively) compared with those with either or both less than the median. the inclusion of both biomarkers improved the c-statistic (for predicting mortality) from 0.78 to 0.82 (p=0.03). matrix metalloproteinase-9 was unrelated to either outcome. conclusion—higher circulating tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and piiinp concentrations are associated with mortality, and higher piiinp is associated with incident cvd, in the community.
revisiting the rise and fall of false recall: presentation rate effects depend on retention interval two experiments examined false recall for lists of semantically and phonologically associated words as a function of presentation duration. veridical recall increased with long exposure durations for all lists. for semantically associated lists, false recall increased from 20-250 ms, then decreased. there was a high level of false recall with 20 ms durations for phonologically associated lists (47 and 44% for experiments 1 and 2, respectively), which declined as duration increased. in experiment 2, for lists presented at 20 and 50 ms rates, false recall given zero correct recall was observed frequently, suggesting that conscious recollection of studied words was not necessary for phonological false memory. differences between phonologically and semantically associated lists were consistent with a feature integration model based on automatic initial processing of phonetic features of words.
reference ranges for haematology, biochemical profile and electrophoresis in a single herd of ragusana donkeys from sicily (italy) most successful books undergo an evolutionary change incorporating new information and increasing in size with each edition. clinical biochemistry is no exception. the ¢rst edition was a small format book, published in 1963, with 9 contributors which dealt, in 13 chapters and 678 pages, with the subject of clinical biochemistry. this latest edition is a large format book (28622 cm) running to 30 chapters and 932 pages. some chapters have been amalgamated (lipids and ketones), while four new chapters have been added since the fourth edition and now tumour markers, toxicology, lysosomal storage diseases and avian biochemistry are included. the list of eminent contributors has also increased from 30 to 35, including the editors. the well tried format of this book is retained with each chapter covering a de¢ned area. in 1963, the ¢rst two chapters covered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. in the latest edition, the ¢rst four chapters cover concepts of normality, dna technology, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. however, despite these similarities between the ¢rst and ¢fth editions, the content of each chapter is radically altered. originally biochemistry was the principle topic, with much emphasis on formuli and biochemical pathways and less on disease and the use of biochemistry in diagnosis. in the latest edition, biochemistry and physiology are inextricably mixed and, in the majority of chapters, considerable emphasis is placed on diagnosis using biochemical based methods as well as other methods, such as muscle biopsy or scintigraphy. there is also an updating of information, although the time taken for a book of this size and complexity actually to reach the market place means that the references are not completely up to date; 1996 is the last date i saw and, in some of the original chapters, there are still signi¢cant numbers of references relating to work completed in the 1960s and 1970s. these comments may make readers who already possess the 4th edition wonder whether there have been su¤cient changes to make the purchase of the latest edition worthwhile. in my opinion purchase of the 5th edition would be bene¢cial. the new chapters cover areas not previously dealt with and extend to almost 900 pages. those chapters where amalgamation has occurred have been extensively rewritten and all the chapters covered in the fourth edition have been updated. in some there have also been major modi¢cations, especially when the author has changed, for example, in the chapter on hepatic function, previously written by charles e. cornelius and now covered by bud c. tennant, or the chapter on vitamins (formerly newberne and conner, now rucker and morris). the ¢fth edition is a well presented hardback book with clear text and very good diagrams, many of which present even very complex data in an easy to understand fashion. each chapter, like those in the fourth edition, is divided into clearly labelled veterinary research communications, 22 (1998) 293^294 # 1998 kluwer academic publishers. printed in the netherlands
clinical, immunological and molecular characterization of dock8 and dock8-like deficient patients: single center experience of twenty five patients background the genetic etiologies of the hyper-ige syndromes are diverse. approximately 60% to 70% of patients with hyper-ige syndrome have dominant mutations in stat3, and a single patient was reported to have a homozygous tyk2 mutation. in the remaining patients with hyper-ige syndrome, the genetic etiology has not yet been identified.   objectives we aimed to identify a gene that is mutated or deleted in autosomal recessive hyper-ige syndrome.   methods we performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis for 9 patients with autosomal-recessive hyper-ige syndrome to locate copy number variations and homozygous haplotypes. homozygosity mapping was performed with 12 patients from 7 additional families. the candidate gene was analyzed by genomic and cdna sequencing to identify causative alleles in a total of 27 patients with autosomal-recessive hyper-ige syndrome.   results subtelomeric biallelic microdeletions were identified in 5 patients at the terminus of chromosome 9p. in all 5 patients, the deleted interval involved dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (dock8), encoding a protein implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. sequencing of patients without large deletions revealed 16 patients from 9 unrelated families with distinct homozygous mutations in dock8 causing premature termination, frameshift, splice site disruption, and single exon deletions and microdeletions. dock8 deficiency was associated with impaired activation of cd4+ and cd8+t cells.   conclusion autosomal-recessive mutations in dock8 are responsible for many, although not all, cases of autosomal-recessive hyper-ige syndrome. dock8 disruption is associated with a phenotype of severe cellular immunodeficiency characterized by susceptibility to viral infections, atopic eczema, defective t-cell activation and t(h)17 cell differentiation, and impaired eosinophil homeostasis and dysregulation of ige.
asymptomatic domestic dogs are carriers of leishmania infantum: possible reservoirs host for human visceral leishmaniasis in southern iran an epidemiological study to examine the sero-prevalence of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis (zvl) among domestic and wild canines in endemic foci of iran was carried out during 1999-2003 to assess the distribution of the disease and the possible association between infection in dogs, wild canines and people. anti-leishmanial antibodies were detected by the direct agglutination test (dat). parasitological study was performed for all captured wild canines and were detected in some of the seropositive dogs with specific clinical signs (n=107). serum samples (n=1568) were collected from domestic dogs in villages that are known endemic foci of human visceral leishmaniosis (hvl). wild canine sera were collected from jackals (canis aureus, n=10), foxes (vulpes vulpes, n=10) and wolves (canis lupus, n=10). of the 1568 serum sampled collected from domestic dogs, 222 (14.2%) were positive by dat (1:320 and above). no statistically significant difference was found between male (15.2%) and female (11.8%) sero-prevalence (p=0.083). dogs of 8 years and above showed the highest sero-prevalence (40.6%). only 23.9% of the seropositive domestic dogs had clinical signs. parasitology and serology tests that were performed in 30 wild canines showed 10% these animals were infected by leishmania infantum. ten out of 11 leishmania spp. isolated from the dogs and wild canines were identified as l. infantum and one other as l. tropica by molecular and biochemical techniques. for the first time in iran, l. infantum and l. tropica were isolated from viscera of both a wolf and a domestic dog.
impact of collection on bark regeneration from stryphnodendron rotundifolium mart. in northeastern brazil due to the current exploitation and consequent extinction of native medicinal plants around the world, new strategies have been proposed to address the sustainable use of this resource. accordingly, the goal of this study is to assess the speed of bark regeneration of myracrodruon urundeuva allemão and to compare the tannin content before and after tissue regeneration. twenty individuals from an area of caatinga in caruaru, pernambuco state (ne brazil), were selected. to evaluate the speed of bark regeneration, four treatments were established, according to the area of bark removed (10 × 2, 6 × 5, 8 × 5 and 10 × 5 cm), with five replicates (five individuals of m. urundeuva allemão) and three treatments of tannin content (bark removed before damage, as regenerated tissue, and non-impacted bark or control). at the end of 23 months of monitoring the regeneration, we found that only seven of the 20 individuals analyzed did not fully heal. no significant correlation between the monthly percent regeneration and average monthly precipitation was found. the tannin content varied according to the quantified tissue (after damage, regenerated and control) as well as between damage classes (20 cm2—41.64 to 63.53 mg; 30 cm2—49.25 to 67.54 mg; 40 cm2—31.69 to 67.44 mg; 50 cm2—34.08 to 48.53 mg). despite the variations found, there was no significant difference between the measurement periods (p > 0.05) or damage classes (p > 0.05). the results showed that the regeneration rate was higher in individuals belonging to the 10 × 2 and 10 × 5 cm groups and that there is no correlation between precipitation and regeneration speed. tannin levels did not vary significantly in the tissues before damage and after regeneration.
increased inos activity is essential for hepatic epithelial tight junction dysfunction in endotoxemic mice. hyperbilirubinemia is frequently associated with endotoxemia. regurgitation of bile constituents including bilirubin into the sinusoidal space is prevented by tight junctions which maintain paracellular permeability between hepatocytes. to investigate the mechanism of endotoxin-associated hyperbilirubinemia, we have studied the changes in paracellular permeability of primary hepatocyte couplets treated with endotoxin. in addition, we examined the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (udca), which has been widely used for various liver diseases, on endotoxin-associated changes in paracellular permeability. the paracellular permeability of hepatocyte couplets was evaluated by paracellular penetration of fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-dextran with molecular weights of 3, 10 and 70k using confocal laser scanning microscopy. endotoxin increased the paracellular penetration of fitc-dextran 3 and 10k. these changes were prevented by treatment with udca. there was little paracellular penetration of fitc-dextran 70k under any conditions. these results suggested that endotoxin increased the paracellular permeability of hepatocyte couplets and these changes were prevented by treatment with udca. furthermore, bile regurgitation through the paracellular route is involved in endotoxin-associated hyperbilirubinemia, and udca might be a potential therapeutic agent for endotoxin-associated hyperbilirubinemia.
risk factors for development of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness after endotracheal intubation in women: a secondary analysis. background diffusion of nitrous oxide into the cuff of the endotracheal tube results in an increase in cuff pressure. excessive endotracheal tube cuff pressure may impair tracheal mucosal perfusion and cause tracheal damage and sore throat. filling the cuff of the endotracheal tube with saline instead of air prevents the increase in cuff pressure due to nitrous oxide diffusion. this method was used to test whether tracheal morbidity is related to excess in tracheal cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia. methods fifty patients with american society of anesthesiologists physical status i or ii were randomly allocated to two groups with endotracheal tube cuffs initially inflated to 20–30 cm h2o with either air (group a) or saline (group s). anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. at the time of extubation, a fiberoptic examination of the trachea was performed by an independent observer, and abnormalities of tracheal mucosa at the level of the cuff contact area were scored. patients assessed their symptoms (sore throat, dysphagia, and hoarseness) at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit and 24 h after extubation on a 101-point numerical rating scale. results cuff pressure increased gradually during anesthesia in group a but remained stable in group s. the incidence of sore throat was greater in group a than in group s in the postanesthesia care unit (76 vs. 20%) and 24 h after extubation (42 vs. 12%;p < 0.05). tracheal lesions at time of extubation were seen in all patients of group a and in eight patients (32%) of group s (p < 0.05). conclusion excess in endotracheal tube cuff pressure during balanced anesthesia due to nitrous oxide diffusion into this closed gas space causes sore throat that is related to tracheal mucosal erosion.
soil fertility promotes decomposition rate of nutrient poor, but not nutrient rich litter through nitrogen transfer litter decomposition provides the primary source of mineral nitrogen (n) for biological activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. a 10-year decomposition experiment in 21 sites from seven biomes found that net n release from leaf litter is dominantly driven by the initial tissue n concentration and mass remaining regardless of climate, edaphic conditions, or biota. arid grasslands exposed to high ultraviolet radiation were an exception, where net n release was insensitive to initial n. roots released n linearly with decomposition and exhibited little net n immobilization. we suggest that fundamental constraints on decomposer physiologies lead to predictable global-scale patterns in net n release during decomposition.
novelty response and 50 khz ultrasonic vocalizations: differential prediction of locomotor and affective response to amphetamine in sprague-dawley rats behavioral sensitization and tolerance to repetitive exposure to addictive drugs are commonly used for the assessment of the early stages of the drug dependence progress in animals. the orchestra of tools for studying the progress of drug dependence in laboratory rodents has been considerably enriched in the 1980s by the introduction of ultrasonic vocalization (usv) detection and characterization. however, the relationship between the results of this technology and those of traditional behavioral tests is not clear. we attempted to elucidate some of the respective ambiguities by comparing the effects of an intermittent amphetamine treatment, which was aimed both at the induction of sensitization and tolerance to this drug and at testing the persistence of these effects, on the locomotor activity and 50-khz usv responses to both the drug and the context of drug exposure in adult male rats showing diverging susceptibility for sensitization to amphetamine. categorization of the rats into low and high responders/callers based on sensitization of their frequency-modulated 50-khz usv responsiveness showed some correspondence with conditioned place preference effects, but not with responses to amphetamine. the study showed distinct changes in the rate and latency of the frequency-modulated 50-khz usv responses to repetitive amphetamine treatment, which were reminiscent of classical behavioral signs of sensitization and tolerance. these results show the utility of the appetitive usv for monitoring of early phases of complex processes leading to drug dependence. however, usv, locomotor activity and conditioned place preference seem to reflect different aspects of these phenomena.
the mecp2‐null mouse hippocampus displays altered basal inhibitory rhythms and is prone to hyperexcitability during slow wave sleep and consummatory behaviors, electroencephalographic recordings from the rodent hippocampus reveal large amplitude potentials called sharp waves. the sharp waves originate from the ca3 circuitry and their generation is correlated with coherent discharges of ca3 pyramidal neurons and dependent on activities mediated by ampa glutamate receptors. to model sharp waves in a relatively large hippocampal circuitry in vitro, we developed thick (1 mm) mouse hippocampal slices by separating the dentate gyrus from the ca2/ca1 areas while keeping the functional dentate gyrus-ca3-ca1 connections. we found that large amplitude (0.3-3 mv) sharp wave-like field potentials occurred spontaneously in the thick slices without extra ionic or pharmacological manipulation and they resemble closely electroencephalographic sharp waves with respect to waveform, regional initiation, pharmacological manipulations, and intracellular correlates. through measuring tissue o2, k+, and synaptic and single cell activities, we verified that the sharp wave-like potentials are not a consequence of anoxia, nonspecific elevation of extracellular k+ and dissection-related tissue damage. our data suggest that a subtle but crucial increase in the ca3 glutamatergic activity effectively recruits a population of neurons thus responsible for the generation of the sharp wave-like spontaneous field potentials in isolated hippocampal circuitry.
assessment of osteonecrosis in the presence of instrumentation for femoral neck fracture using contrast-enhanced mavric sequence between 1980 and 1989 71 patients with a femoral neck fracture were treated at the university hospital of basel by a dynamic hip screw (n = 54) or by three compression screws (n = 17). fifty out of 71 patients (70%) were reviewed clinically and radiologically after an average of 116 months. 32/50 fractures (64%) had united. in 18/50 (36%) either avascular necrosis (12) or secondary fracture dislocation (6) had resulted in failure after an average of 29 months following injury. despite these results, the patients assessment had been very good or good in 44 patients (88%) and fair only in six patients (12%). the cause of secondary dislocation proved to be mainly due to a technical failure at surgery. the incidence of avascular necrosis was significantly higher in displaced fractures compared to non-displaced fractures (p < 0.05), regardless of the quality of the reduction achieved (varus or valgus) or the time delay between accident and operation. however it was interesting to note, that more than one third of all avascular necrosis became apparent more than 3 years (4-10 years) after the accident.
epstein–barr virus acquires its final envelope on intracellular compartments with golgi markers enveloped viruses acquire their host‐derived membrane at a variety of intracellular locations. herpesviruses are complex entities that undergo several budding and fusion events during an infection. all members of this large family are believed to share a similar life cycle. however, they seemingly differ in terms of acquisition of their mature envelope. herpes simplex virus is often believed to bud into an existing intracellular compartment, while the related cytomegalovirus may acquire its final envelope from a novel virus‐induced assembly compartment. this review focuses on recent advances in the characterization of cellular compartment(s) potentially contributing to herpes virion final envelopment. it also examines the common points between seemingly distinct envelopment pathways and highlights the dynamic nature of intracellular compartments in the context of herpesvirus infections.
activation of a helper and not regulatory human cd4+ t cell response by oncolytic h-1 parvovirus treatment of cancers by means of viruses, that specifically replicate in (oncotropism) and kill (oncolysis) neoplastic cells, is increasingly gaining acceptance in the clinic. among these agents, parvoviruses have been shown to possess not only direct oncolytic but also immunomodulating properties, serving as an adjuvant to prime the immune system to react against infected tumors. here, we aimed to establish whether immunomodulating mechanisms participate in the recently reported therapeutic potential of parvoviruses against pancreatic carcinoma. using adoptive transfer experiments we discovered that the transfer of splenocytes of donor rats harboring h-1pv-treated orthotopic pdac tumors could significantly prolong the survival of naïve tumor-bearing recipients, compared to those receiving cells from mock-treated donors. closer investigation of immunological parameters in infected donor rats revealed that virus-induced interferon gamma production and cellular immune response played an important role in this effect. these data have also preclinical relevance since abortive h-1pv infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or cocultivation of these cells with h-1pv-preinfected pancreatic cancer cells, resulted in enhancement of innate and adaptive immune reactivity. taken together our data reveal that oncolytic h-1pv modulates the immune system into an anticancer state, and further support the concept of using parvoviruses in the fight against pancreatic cancer.
extending the ontological model for urinary profiles in this thesis, we aim at contributing to the theory of conceptual modeling and ontology representation. our main objective here is to provide ontological foundations for the most fundamental concepts in conceptual modeling. these foundations comprise a number of ontological theories, which are built on established work on philosophical ontology, cognitive psychology, philosophy of language and linguistics. together these theories amount to a system of categories and formal relations known as a foundational ontology
the reaction of the pelvis to the implantation of the acetabular component of the hip endoprosthesis--initial tests with the use of computerized tomography. thirty-four hips in which there had been prosthetic replacement were selected for study because of the presence of linear (diffuse) or lytic (localized) areas of periprosthetic bone loss. in all hips, there was careful documentation of the anatomical location of the material that had been obtained for histological analysis, and the specific purpose of the removal of the tissue was for examination to determine the cause of the resorption of bone. specimens from twenty-three hips were retrieved during an operation and from eleven hips, at autopsy. the area of bone loss was linear only in sixteen hips, lytic only in thirteen, and both linear and lytic in five. in all thirty-four hips, intracellular particulate debris was found in the macrophages that were present in the area of bone resorption. all thirty-four had intracellular particles of polyethylene, many of which were less than one micrometer in size. thirty-one hips had extracellular particles of polyethylene as well. twenty-two of the thirty-four hips had intracellular metallic debris; in ten, metallic debris was found extracellularly as well. ten of the sixteen cemented specimens had intracellular and extracellular polymethylmethacrylate debris. in the mechanically stable prostheses--cemented and uncemented--polyethylene wear debris was identified in areas of bone resorption far from the articular surfaces. the number of macrophages in a microscopic field was directly related to the amount of particulate polyethylene debris that was visible by light microscopy. although the gross radiographic appearances of linear bone loss and lytic bone loss were different, the histological appearance of the regions in which there was active bone resorption was similar. regardless of the radiographic appearance and anatomical origin of the specimen, bone resorption was found to occur in association with macrophages that were laden with polyethylene debris. in general, the number of macrophages present had a direct relationship to the degree of bone resorption that was seen. we believe that these findings indicate that joint fluid penetrates far more extensively than previously thought, even in a well fixed component, along the interface between the prosthesis and bone and in the periprosthetic tissues; it is often more extensive than is shown by arthrography. we therefore suggest the concept of the effective joint space to include all periprosthetic regions that are accessible to joint fluid and thus accessible to particulate debris.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
the influence of the val158met catechol-o-methyltransferase polymorphism on the personality traits of bipolar patients researchers using various psychological measures and instruments have concluded that the personality of remitted bipolars and normal controls are essentially similar. we recently suggested that specific personality traits might be genetic markers for manic-depressive illness. the tridimensional personality questionnaire (tpq) is a personality questionnaire with heritable subscales and hypothesized anchoring in neurochemistry. we studied the personality of euthymic bipolar manic depressive patients using the tpq. subjects were volunteers from the out-patient lithium clinic. tpqs were individually administered to 50 euthymic bipolar patients. persistence is significantly reduced, and harm avoidance and reward dependence significantly increased, compared with u.s. norms. these traits may be part of the genetic diathesis for manic-depressive illness.
laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis: is this a feasible option for developing countries? background appendectomy can be performed using either a laparoscopic or an open technique. this study compares the outcome of patients treated for acute appendicitis by open appendectomy with the outcome of those undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy.   methods patients undergoing appendectomy at the mount sinai hospital between 1994 and 1998 were studied. outcome of patients having open appendectomy was compared with that of patients having laparoscopic appendectomy.   results seven hundred fifty-eight patients underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis during the 5-year study period. two hundred seventy-one (36%) had open appendectomy and 487 (64%) had laparoscopic appendectomy. patients subsequently found to have a normal appendix had the highest rate of laparoscopic appendectomy, whereas those with gangrenous appendicitis were most likely to have open appendectomy (p <0.05). there was a significant decline in the postoperative length of stay for open cases during the length of the study. in the final year, the difference in length of stay between open and laparoscopic appendectomy was only 1 day. patients with gangrenous appendicitis had a significantly longer length of stay than did patients with a normal appendix or suppurative appendicitis. the hospital cost of laparoscopic appendectomy was greater than that for open appendectomy but the extra expenditure in the operating room was offset by the longer length of stay of the patients having open surgery.   conclusions differences in outcome between open and laparoscopic appendectomy are minor. in this study, more difficult cases with gangrenous appendicitis were more likely to require open appendectomy whereas milder forms of appendicitis, especially in women, were more likely to be treated by laparoscopy. savings from the slightly shorter hospital stay after laparoscopic appendectomy are offset by the higher surgical cost of the laparoscopic equipment.
atomic interactions of neonicotinoid agonists with achbp: molecular recognition of the distinctive electronegative pharmacophore upon ligand binding at the subunit interfaces, the extracellular domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor undergoes conformational changes, and agonist binding allosterically triggers opening of the ion channel. the soluble acetylcholine‐binding protein (achbp) from snail has been shown to be a structural and functional surrogate of the ligand‐binding domain (lbd) of the receptor. yet, individual achbp species display disparate affinities for nicotinic ligands. the crystal structure of achbp from aplysia californica in the apo form reveals a more open loop c and distinctive positions for other surface loops, compared with previous structures. analysis of aplysia achbp complexes with nicotinic ligands shows that loop c, which does not significantly change conformation upon binding of the antagonist, methyllycaconitine, further opens to accommodate the peptidic antagonist, α‐conotoxin imi, but wraps around the agonists lobeline and epibatidine. the structures also reveal extended and nonoverlapping interaction surfaces for the two antagonists, outside the binding loci for agonists. this comprehensive set of structures reflects a dynamic template for delineating further conformational changes of the lbd of the nicotinic receptor.
skin colonization by malassezia spp. in hospitalized neonates and infants in a tertiary care centre in north india malassezia furfur, a lipophilic yeast, has become recognized as a cause of sepsis in infants receiving parenteral fat emulsions via indwelling deep venous catheters. colonization of infants' skin may be a prerequisite to colonization of the intravascular catheter and subsequent infection with m furfur. three hundred ninety-three surveillance cultures were performed on 146 infants during their first 12 weeks of hospitalization in the intensive care unit (icu) or the neonatal transitional unit (ntu). in addition, 47 full-term newborn infants and 38 healthy infants in the well-baby clinic were cultured. colonization rates were greatest (48%) during the second month of hospitalization for the infants in the icu/ntu group. in contrast, 0 of 47 newborn infants and 2 of 38 healthy infants were colonized. prematurity and a prolonged length of stay were identified as risk factors for colonization.
sex differences in the growth of white matter during adolescence we used voxel-based morphometry (vbm) to examine human brain asymmetry and the effects of sex and handedness on brain structure in 465 normal adults. we observed significant asymmetry of cerebral grey and white matter in the occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes (petalia), including heschl's gyrus, planum temporale (pt) and the hippocampal formation. males demonstrated increased leftward asymmetry within heschl's gyrus and pt compared to females. there was no significant interaction between asymmetry and handedness and no main effect of handedness. there was a significant main effect of sex on brain morphology, even after accounting for the larger global volumes of grey and white matter in males. females had increased grey matter volume adjacent to the depths of both central sulci and the left superior temporal sulcus, in right heschl's gyrus and pt, in right inferior frontal and frontomarginal gyri and in the cingulate gyrus. females had significantly increased grey matter concentration extensively and relatively symmetrically in the cortical mantle, parahippocampal gyri, and in the banks of the cingulate and calcarine sulci. males had increased grey matter volume bilaterally in the mesial temporal lobes, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and in the anterior lobes of the cerebellum, but no regions of increased grey matter concentration.
roles for substance p and gastrin-releasing peptide as neurotransmitters released by primary afferent pruriceptors. the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating histamine-independent itch in primary sensory neurons are largely unknown. itch induced by chloroquine (cq) is a common side effect of this widely used antimalarial drug. here, we show that mrgprs, a family of g protein-coupled receptors expressed exclusively in peripheral sensory neurons, function as itch receptors. mice lacking a cluster of mrgpr genes display significant deficits in itch induced by cq but not histamine. cq directly excites sensory neurons in an mrgpr-dependent manner. cq specifically activates mouse mrgpra3 and human mrgprx1. loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that mrgpra3 is required for cq responsiveness in mice. furthermore, mrgpra3-expressing neurons respond to histamine and coexpress gastrin-releasing peptide, a peptide involved in itch sensation, and mrgprc11. activation of these neurons with the mrgprc11-specific agonist bam8-22 induces itch in wild-type but not mutant mice. therefore, mrgprs may provide molecular access to itch-selective neurons and constitute novel targets for itch therapeutics.
sustaining evidence-based prevention programs: correlates in a large-scale dissemination initiative this article presents an informed definition of sustainability and an associated planning model for sustaining innovations (pertinent to both infrastructure and interventions) within organizational, community, and state systems. the planning model stems from a systematic review of the literature and from concepts derived from a series of ‘think tanks’ made up of key substance abuse prevention professionals. the model assumes a five-step process (i.e. assessment, development, implementation, evaluation, and reassessment/modification) and addresses factors known to inhibit efforts to sustain an innovation. one set of factors concerns the capacity of prevention systems to support sustainable innovations. the other pertains to the extent to which a particular innovation is sustainable. a sustainability action strategy is presented that includes goals with corresponding sets of objectives, actions, and results that determine the extent of readiness to sustain an innovation. sustainability tools to assist in implementing the planning model are illustrated, and next steps for the model are discussed. this planning model provides a conceptual and practical understanding of sustainability that can lead to further investigation. q 2004 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
behavioral and molecular alterations in mice resulting from chronic treatment with dexamethasone: relevance to depression glucocorticoids stimulate the intestinal absorption of na(+) and water partly by regulation of the na(+)/h(+) exchanger 3 (nhe3). previous studies have shown both genomic and nongenomic regulation of nhe3 by glucocorticoids. serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (sgk1) has been shown to be part of this cascade, where phosphorylation of nhe3 by sgk1 initiates the translocation of nhe3 to the cell surface. in the present work, we examined a series of changes in sgk1 and nhe3 induced by glucocorticoids using human colonic caco-2 and opossum kidney cells. we found that dexamethasone rapidly stimulated sgk1 mrnas, but a significant change in protein abundance was not detected. instead, there was an increase in sgk1 kinase activity as early as at 2 h. an increase in nhe3 protein abundance was not detected until 12 h of dexamethasone exposure, although the transport activity was significantly stimulated at 4 h. these data demonstrate that the changes of sgk1 precede those of nhe3. chronic regulation (24 h) of nhe3 was blocked completely by prevention of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or actinomycin d and by the glucocorticoid receptor blocker ru486. the acute effect of dexamethasone was similarly abrogated by ru486, but was insensitive to cycloheximide and actinomycin d. similarly, the stimulation of sgk1 activity by dexamethasone was blocked by ru486 but not by actinomycin d. together, these data show that the acute effect of glucocorticoids on nhe3 is mediated by a glucocorticoid receptor dependent mechanism that activates sgk1 in a nongenomic manner.
comparison of survival times for dogs with pituitary‐dependent hyperadrenocorticism in a primary‐care hospital: treated with trilostane versus untreated the survival times of 148 dogs treated for pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism were studied using clinical records from 3 uk veterinary centers between 1998 and 2003. of these animals, 123 (83.1%) were treated with trilostane, while 25 (16.9%) were treated with mitotane. treatment groups were compared using t-tests and analysis of variance (or their nonparametric equivalents) and chi-square tests. survival data were analyzed using kaplan-meier survival plots and cox proportional hazard methods. there was no significant difference between the population attributes from each center or between treatment groups. the median survival time for animals treated with trilostane was 662 days (range 8-1,971) and for mitotane it was 708 days (range 33-1,399). there were no significant differences between the survival times for animals treated with trilostane and those treated with mitotane. in the multivariable model (including drug, center, breed group, weight, diagnostic group, and age at diagnosis), only age at diagnosis and weight were significantly negatively associated with survival. importantly, there was no significant effect of drug choice on survival.
age dependency of inhibition of α7 nicotinic receptors and tonically active n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors by endogenously produced kynurenic acid in the brain abstract: this study was designed to investigate modulatory mechanisms that control the synthesis of the neuroprotective endogenous excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenate. de novo kynurenate formation was examined in vitro using tissue slices from rat brain, liver, and kidney. in slices from adult cerebral cortex, veratridine, quisqualate, and l‐α‐aminoadipate decreased kynurenate synthesis substantially. glucose removal or changes in the ionic milieu, too, influenced kynurenate formation significantly, suggesting that demands on cellular energy interfere with kynurenate production in the adult rat brain. the effects of quisqualate and l‐α‐aminoadipate were also observed in the immature brain, in the quinolinate‐lesioned adult striatum, and, to a lesser extent, in peripheral organs. in contrast, the effect of veratridine was not seen in the lesioned brain or in kidney and liver tissue, indicating its dependency on intact neuron‐glia interactions. compared with the normal adult brain, ionic manipulations yielded qualitatively distinct results in the developing brain and in the periphery, but their effects remained unchanged in the lesioned striatum. glucose deprivation was less consequential in the immature than in the adult brain and was entirely ineffective in the lesioned striatum and in the periphery. these results further link cellular, especially astrocytic, energy metabolism to kynurenate formation in the brain. more generally, the existence of brain‐specific mechanisms for the regulation of kynurenate production is suggestive of a modulatory role of this metabolite in excitatory amino acid receptor function and dysfunction.
the burden of pertussis hospitalization in hiv-exposed and hiv-unexposed south african infants background. there is a paucity of data regarding the burden of bordetella pertussis in african women and young infants, and particularly the impact of maternal human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection thereon. we performed a retrospective analysis of respiratory illness samples from longitudinal cohorts of hiv-uninfected and hiv-infected women and their infants to evaluate the burden of pertussis illness in a black-african community. methods. the women were followed up for respiratory illness from midpregnancy and together with their infants until 24 weeks postpartum. respiratory samples obtained at the time of illness visits were tested for b. pertussis by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results. the study included 194 hiv-infected and 1060 hiv-uninfected women, and 188 and 1028 infant offspring, respectively. there were 7 pcr-confirmed pertussis cases in the hiv-exposed infants and 30 in hiv-unexposed infants (7.4 vs 5.5 episodes per 1000 infant-months; p = .47), at a mean age of 70.9 days. all infant pertussis cases had a history of cough (mean duration, 6.3 days). six of 17 (35.3%) pertussis-confirmed cases in infants <2 months of age were admitted to hospital within 21 days of b. pertussis detection, whereas none of the 20 cases ≥2 months of age required hospitalization. ten pcr-positive pertussis-associated illnesses were detected in hiv-infected women compared with 32 in the hiv-uninfected women (6.8 vs 3.9 episodes per 1000 person-months; p = .12). conclusions. bordetella pertussis identification was common among young infants with respiratory illness, most of whom were too young to be fully protected through direct vaccination. vaccination of pregnant women might be a valuable strategy in a setting such us ours to prevent b. pertussis–associated illness in women and their young infants.
response of the mosquito protein interaction network to dengue infection abstract the matrix (m) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) is a potent inhibitor of bidirectional nuclear transport. here we demonstrate that inhibition occurs when m protein is in the nucleus ofxenopus laevis oocytes and that m activity is readily reversed by a monoclonal antibody (αm). we identify a region of m protein, amino acids 51 to 59, that is required both for inhibition of transport and for efficient recognition by αm. when expressed in transfected hela cells, m protein colocalizes with nuclear pore complexes (npcs) at the nuclear rim. moreover, mutation of a single amino acid, methionine 51, eliminates both transport inhibition and targeting to npcs. we propose that m protein inhibits bidirectional transport by interacting with a component of the npc or an npc-associated factor that participates in nucleocytoplasmic transport.
on longest increasing subsequences and random young tableaux: experimental results and recent theorems the expected value of l n , the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation of f1; : : : ; ng, has been studied extensively. this paper presents the results of both monte carlo and exact computations that explore the ner structure of the distribution of l n. the results suggested that several of the conjectures that had been made about l n were incorrect, and led to new conjectures, some of which have been proved recently by jinho baik, percy deift, and kurt johansson. in particular, the standard deviation of l n is of order n 1=6 , contrary to earlier conjectures. this paper also explains some regular patterns in the distribution of l n .

characterizing spatiotemporal variations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in headwater catchment of a key drinking water source in china taihu basin is the most developed area in china, which economic development has resulted in pollutants being produced and discharged into rivers and the lake. lake taihu is located in the center of the basin, which is characterized by a complex network of rivers and channels. to assess the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter (dom) in surface waters, we determined the components and abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cdom) within lake taihu and 66 of its tributaries, and 22 sites along transects from two main rivers. in lake taihu, there was a relative less spatial variation in cdom absorption a(cdom)(355) with a mean of 2.46 ± 0.69 m⁻¹ compared to the mean of 3.36 ± 1.77 m⁻¹ in the rivers. two autochthonous tryptophan-like components (c1 and c5), two humic-like components (c2 and c3), and one autochthonous tyrosine-like component (c4) were identified using the parallel factor analysis (parafac) model. the c2 and c3 had a direct relationship with a(cdom)(355), dissolved organic carbon (doc), and chemical oxygen demand (cod). the separation of lake samples from river samples, on both axes of the principal component analysis (pca), showed the difference in dom fluorophores between these various environments. components c1 and c5 concurrently showed positive factor 1 loadings, while c4 was close to the negative factor 1 axis. components c2 and c3 showed positive second factor loadings. the major contribution of autochthonous tryptophan-like components to lake samples is due to the autochthonous production of cdom in the lake ecosystems. the results also showed that the differences in geology and associated land use control cdom dynamics, such as the high levels of cdom with terrestrial characteristics in the northwestern upstream rivers and low levels of cdom with increased microbial characteristics in the southwestern upstream rivers. most of river samples from the downstream regions in the eastern and southeastern plains had a similar relative abundance of humic-like fluorescence, with less of the tryptophan-like and more of the tyrosine-like contributions than did samples from upstream regions.
the chromatin modifier satb1 regulates cell fate through fgf signalling in the early mouse embryo fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) are thought to influence many processes in vertebrate development because of their diverse sites of expression and wide range of biological activities in in vitro culture systems. as a means of elucidating embryonic functions of fgf-4, gene targeting was used to generate mice harboring a disrupted fgf4 gene. embryos homozygous for the null allele underwent uterine implantation and induced uterine decidualization but did not develop substantially thereafter. as was consistent with their behavior in vivo, fgf4 null embryos cultured in vitro displayed severely impaired proliferation of the inner cell mass, whereas growth and differentiation of the inner cell mass were rescued when null embryos were cultured in the presence of fgf-4 protein.
tetrazolium salts for mic determination in microplates: why? which salt to select? how? the aim of this study was to screen and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of indigenous jordanian plant extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, using the rapid xtt assay and viable count methods. xtt rapid assay was used for the initial screening of antimicrobial activity for the plant extracts. antimicrobial activity of potentially active plant extracts was further assessed using the "viable plate count" method. four degrees of antimicrobial activity (high, moderate, weak and inactive) against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, were recorded. the plant extracts of hypericum triquetrifolium, ballota undulata, ruta chalepensis, ononis natrix, paronychia argentea and marrubium vulgare had shown promising antimicrobial activity. this study showed that while both xtt and viable count methods are comparable when estimating the overall antimicrobial activity of experimental substances, there is no strong linear correlation between the two methods.
soil fertility promotes decomposition rate of nutrient poor, but not nutrient rich litter through nitrogen transfer litter decomposition provides the primary source of mineral nitrogen (n) for biological activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. a 10-year decomposition experiment in 21 sites from seven biomes found that net n release from leaf litter is dominantly driven by the initial tissue n concentration and mass remaining regardless of climate, edaphic conditions, or biota. arid grasslands exposed to high ultraviolet radiation were an exception, where net n release was insensitive to initial n. roots released n linearly with decomposition and exhibited little net n immobilization. we suggest that fundamental constraints on decomposer physiologies lead to predictable global-scale patterns in net n release during decomposition.
multiple infection sources identification with provable guarantees assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.
emergence of cooperative long-term market loyalty in double auction markets self-tuning experience weighted attraction (ewa) is a one-parameter theory of learning in  games. it addresses a criticism that an earlier model (ewa) has too many parameters, by  fixing some parameters at plausible values and replacing others with functions of experience  so that they no longer need to be estimated. consequently, it is econometrically simpler  than the popular weighted fictitious play and reinforcement learning models.  the functions of experience which replace free parameters “self-tune” over time, adjusting  in a way that selects a sensible learning rule to capture subjects’ choice dynamics. for  instance, the self-tuning ewa model can turn from a weighted fictitious play into an averaging  reinforcement learning as subjects equilibrate and learn to ignore inferior foregone  payoffs. the theory was tested on seven different games, and compared to the earlier parametric  ewa model and a one-parameter stochastic equilibrium theory (qre). self-tuning  ewa does as well as ewa in predicting behavior in new games, even though it has fewer  parameters, and fits reliably better than the qre equilibrium benchmark.
universitet reduced sickness absence after a physical activity intervention among health care workers : one-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial backgroundhealth care workers have high physical work demands, involving patient handling and manual work tasks. a strategy for prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders can enhance the physical capacity of the health care worker. the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 'tailored physical activity’ for health care workers in the sonderborg municipality.methods/designthis protocol describes the design of a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of 'tailored physical activity’ versus a reference group for health care workers in the sonderborg municipality. inclusion criteria to be fulfilled: health care workers with daily work that includes manual work and with the experience of work-related musculoskeletal pain in the back or upper body.all participants will receive 'health guidance’, a (90-minute) individualised dialogue focusing on improving life style, based on assessments of risk behaviour, on motivation for change and on personal resources. in addition, the experimental groups will receive 'tailored physical activity’ (three 50-minute sessions per week over 10 weeks). the reference group will receive only 'health guidance’.the primary outcome measure is the participants’ self-reported sickness absence during the last three months due to musculoskeletal troubles, measured 3 and 12 months after baseline.in addition, secondary outcomes include anthropometric measurements, functional capacity and self-reported number of sick days, musculoskeletal symptoms, self-reported health, work ability, work productivity, physical capacity, kinesiophobia and physical functional status.discussionthe results from this study will contribute to the knowledge about evidence-based interventions for prevention of sickness absence among health care workers.trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov: nct01543984.
optical technologies and molecular imaging for cervical neoplasia: a program project update. objective this review evaluates the diagnostic efficacy of fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, and their combination that use both point probe and multispectral imaging approaches in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo.   methods articles were selected for this review from a literature search which report the performance of fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy devices in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo. this analysis focused on the comparison of point probe versus multispectral approaches; the use of fluorescence, reflectance, and their combination; and finally the types of populations that have been studied for in vivo diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (sil).   results twenty-six studies were included and their heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analysis. though point probes were expected to have greater specificity and multispectral approaches greater sensitivity, there was considerable overlap in the performance of point probe and multispectral devices. there were few studies that studied fluorescence spectroscopy alone and reflectance spectroscopy alone. combined fluorescence and reflectance approaches showed considerable overlap among point probe and multispectral devices. the overlap of performance suggests that fluorescence and reflectance may have similar performance. currently the paucity of data precludes definitive conclusions regarding the additive effect of both approaches. only two of twenty-six trials have recruited patients with no history of an abnormal papanicolaou smear (screening populations) and twenty-four trials include patients with a range of cervical abnormalities from atypia to cancer (diagnostic populations).   discussion optical spectroscopy using a point probe and multispectral approaches appears to overlap in performance. fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopies examine different aspects of epithelial-stromal biology and appear to yield similar diagnostic performance. while intuitively appealing, their combination may or may not be additive. there have been few studies of these technologies in screening populations. better definitions of device trial design and reporting requirements would facilitate combining analyses to formally examine performance.
sexual selection on aggressiveness in females: evidence from an experimental test with tree swallows there has recently been an increase in interest in the notion that female ornamentation is selected through male choice, rather than being an artefact of selection on male ornamentation. there are, however, key differences between the sexes in the type of selection pressures that are likely to generate ornamentation and important differences in investment tradeoffs. here, i discuss that female ornamentation might be selected more often through female competition over resources than through competition over mates, as exemplified in a recent study by heinsohn and colleagues.
distribution and prevalence of cytauxzoon felis in bobcats (lynx rufus), the natural reservoir, and other wild felids in thirteen states. a male domestic shorthair cat was presented with lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia and respiratory harshness. diagnostic clinical chemistries, viral identification and tissue fluorescent antibody testing were negative or revealed no underlying system failure. histopathology examination revealed multifocal, variable sized and shaped protozoal life forms in the brain, heart, lung, intestine, spleen, lymph node and kidney consistent with the intraleukocytic schizonts of cytauxzoon felis.
associations between osteoprotegerin polymorphisms and bone mineral density: a meta-analysis given that osteoprotegerin plays an important role in bone remodeling, the osteoprotegerin gene may be a candidate locus for susceptibility to osteoporosis. the relation of polymorphisms in the promoter of the osteoprotegerin gene to bone mineral density (bmd) was examined in a japanese population-based prospective cohort study with randomly recruited subjects (1095 women and 1125 men for the 950t --> c polymorphism, 1094 women and 1127 men for the 245t --> g polymorphism). bmd at the radius was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and that for the total body, lumbar spine, right femoral neck, right trochanter, and right ward's triangle was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. genotypes were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific dna primer assay system. among 950t --> c genotypes, bmd for the proximal radius was lower in premenopausal women with the cc genotype than in those with the tt or tc genotype; the difference in bmd between the two groups was 3.9% (p=0.0075). among 245t --> g genotypes, bmd for the radius, total body, femoral neck, trochanter, and ward's triangle was lower in postmenopausal women with the gg genotype than in those with the tt or tg genotype, the tt genotype, or the tg genotype; the differences in bmd between the gg genotype and the tt or tg genotype were 19.8% for the distal radius (p=0.0015), 13.1% for the proximal radius (p=0.0095), 11.2% for the total body (p=0.0013), 12.9% for the femoral neck (p=0.0067), 18.7% for the trochanter (p=0.0008), and 27.1% for ward's triangle (p=0.0038). bmd was not associated with the 950t --> c or 245t --> g genotypes in men. the present results implicate the osteoprotegerin gene as a susceptibility locus for reduced bmd in japanese women.
global population structure of aspergillus terreus inferred by issr typing reveals geographical subclustering abstract phylogenetic analyses of sequences generated from portions of three genes coding for the proteins enolase (enoa), β-tubulin (bena), and calmodulin (calm) of a large number of isolates within the section terrei, genus aspergillus, revealed the presence of a new cryptic species within this section, aspergillus alabamensis. most members of this new cryptic species were recovered as colonizing isolates from immunocompetent patient populations, had decreased in vitro susceptibilities to the antifungal drug amphotericin b, and were morphologically similar to but genetically distinct from aspergillus terreus isolates.
osteogenic cells derived from embryonic stem cells produced bone nodules in three-dimensional scaffolds the optimization of seeding and culturing of human osteoblast-like cells on three collagen-based biomaterials (bovine, equine and calf collagen membrane) was studied by cell proliferation and cell colonization (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. osteoblasts of five patients were seeded onto the three biomaterials and two different parameters were varied: the time intervals between initial seeding and adding culture medium (2 h 6 h. 12 h, 24 h) and the seeding concentration (1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6)cells/ml) of cells onto biomaterials. the results of the study demonstrated that the time interval between seeding osteoblasts and adding culture medium as well as the seeding concentration effects the cell proliferation and the cell colonization. the best proliferation rate was achieved by adding the culture medium 2 h after initial seeding and with a seeding density of 1 x 10(5) cells/ml. moreover, all three biomaterials resulted in different proliferation rates. the best proliferation rate resulted with the bovine collagen membrane. in conclusion, the examined parameters are very important for the development of the tissue engineering techniques and in a larger perspective also for reconstructive surgery.
the rewarding effects of ethanol are modulated by binge eating of a high-fat diet during adolescence restricting access to high-fat foods is a common strategy utilized to promote health. this strategy may contribute to episodes of overconsumption, however, when the restricted foods subsequently become available. the present study utilized a rat feeding procedure to determine if restricting access to an optional source of dietary fat would increase later consumption of that food under nonenergy-deprived conditions. five groups of male sprague-dawley rats were used, all of which had continuous access to a standard rodent diet and water. the control group had no access to shortening. the low-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening every day. the high-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening on monday, wednesday, and friday. two additional groups were switched between the high and low conditions. two-hour and 24-h food intakes were measured every day for 6 weeks. at the end of the study rats were sacrificed and carcass composition determined. as access to the shortening decreased, consumption during the 2-h access period increased. rats compensated for the increased shortening consumption by decreasing intake of the standard diet. thus, cumulative energy consumption did not differ among the groups. when switched between the high and low conditions, rats rapidly adjusted to the change in shortening availability. there were no effects of access schedule on carcass composition. these results indicate that restricting access to an optional high-fat food, even under nonenergy-deprived conditions, can promote significant increases in the consumption of that food when it subsequently becomes available.
language equations with complementation: expressive power it is known that for a regular language l and an arbitrary language k the largest solution of the inequality xk⊆lx is regular. here we show that there exist finite languages k and p and star-free languages l, m and r such that the largest solutions of the systems $\{xk\subseteq lx,\ x\subseteq m\}$ and $\{xk\subseteq lx,\ xp\subseteq rx\}$ are not recursively enumerable.
monitoring viable cells of the biological control agent lactobacillus plantarum pm411 in aerial plant surfaces by means of a strain-specific viability quantitative pcr method biological control agents (bcas) play an important role in crop protection. they can improve sustainability, prevent resistance to fungicides in target pathogens and reduce fungicide residues on produce. bacillus subtilis strain qst713 (serenade max; bayer cropscience, leverkusen, germany) and bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strain d747 [amylo-x; cbc europe s.r.l.—biogard division, nova milanese (mb), italy] are two commercially available bcas that are used against grey mould on table grape and other crops. taqman-based quantitative (q)pcr assays were developed and validated for quantitative and specific detection of the two bcas on grape bunches following field sprays. specific molecular markers were developed for each bca, and taqman probes were designed and tested in qpcr on dna extracted from washing water of grape berries. the assay proved specific and sensitive for both bcas allowing detection at density as low as three colony-forming units (cfu) per gram of berries. the method will be useful to investigate the population dynamics of the two bcas following their applications in vineyards.
allosteric regulation of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase by atp for nucleotide selection 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (erythro) and its threo isomer were synthesized and investigated for their inhibition of hiv reverse transcriptase from virus isolate u 937/htlv-iii. the erythro isomer was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction directed by (ra)n(dt)12-18 and the ki value was 0.0022 microm. the threo isomer was at least 100-fold less active. the inhibition was specific for dtmp incorporation, and dgmp incorporation using (rc)n(dg)12-18 as template/primer was not affected. the km value for dttp varied between 0.7 microm and 1.7 microm. reverse transcriptase from nine hiv isolates were tested for inhibition by the erythro isomer and only slight differences in sensitivity were observed.
anatomical features associated with venous congestion in diep flap using ct angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction background: despite improving outcomes, venous problems in the harvest of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) flaps remain the more common vascular complications. however, it is apparent that the venous anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall has not been described to the same extent as the arterial anatomy. previous anatomical studies have focused on cadaveric anatomy or excisional specimens. the current study uses in vivo computed tomographic angiography to evaluate this anatomy, in combination with a cadaveric radiographic study. methods: both cadaveric and in vivo studies were undertaken using eight whole fresh cadaveric specimens (16 sides) and 100 patients undergoing diep flap breast reconstruction (200 sides). the cadaveric component used direct catheter venography and the in vivo studies were undertaken using preoperative computed tomographic angiography, mapping in vivo venous flow. results: the location, caliber, course, and distribution of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric veins were recorded. the dominance of each system and their direction of drainage were described. mechanisms for poor venous drainage were postulated, including perforator size, midline crossover of the superficial inferior epigastric vein, and the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vein communications. the incidence of each of these anatomical factors was evaluated. conclusion: the cause of venous compromise is multifactorial, with the current study showing that preoperative computed tomographic angiography may predict venous problems during flap harvest, by demonstrating perforator diameter, midline crossover, and deep-superficial venous communications.
carpal tunnel syndrome: clinical, electrophysiological, and ultrasonographic ratio after surgery patients (n = 3336) who had been tested for suspected carpal tunnel syndrome (cts) were contacted by postal questionnaire and their opinions sought of the overall subjective outcome of any treatments using a five‐point rating scale. operative results were compared with preoperative nerve conduction, clinical and demographic variables, and a multiple logistic regression analysis used to identify significant prognostic factors. among 1268 surgical procedures that were identified, the overall surgical success rate was 69%. preoperative nerve conduction study findings, greater age, lower symptom scores, longer disease duration, and male gender were significant predictors of poor outcome. nerve conduction studies had the strongest effect, with patients with middle‐grade abnormalities having better results than those with either very severe or no abnormality. surgical carpal tunnel decompression has a significant failure rate. the preoperative nerve conduction studies account for a proportion of the total variation in outcome. © 2001 john wiley & sons, inc. mucle nerve 24: 935–940, 2001
molecular typing and phenotype characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates from blood in taiwan abstract clonal complex 59 (cc59) community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa) strains were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, diagnostic dna microarrays, and pcrs targeting staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) elements and panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl). six distinct groups within cc59 were characterized. at least seven different variants of sccmec elements were identified (iva [2b], ivb [2b], ivd [2b], iv variant [2b], iva [2b&5], v variant [5c2], and v [5c2&5]). (the structural type is indicated by a roman numeral, with a lowercase letter indicating the subtype, and the ccr complex and the mec complex are indicated by an arabic numeral and an uppercase letter, respectively. where there is an extra ccr element, this is indicated by “&” and an arabic numeral designating the ccr type.) the first group is similar to the american sequence type 59 (st59) mrsa-iv ca-mrsa strain usa1000. the second group includes a pvl-negative st87 strain with an sccmec element of subtype ivb (2b). the third group comprises pvl-variable st59 mrsa-iv strains harboring multiple sccmec iv subtypes. pvl-negative st59 mrsa strains with multiple or composite sccmec elements (iva [2b&5]) form the fourth group. group 5 corresponds to the internationally known “taiwan clone,” a pvl-positive strain with a variant sccmec element (v [5c2&5]). this strain proved to be the most common cc59 mrsa strain isolated in western australia. finally, group 6 encompasses the st59 mrsa-v variant (5c2). the differentiation of cc59 into groups and strains indicates a rapid evolution and spread of sccmec elements. observed differences between groups of strains as well as intrastrain variability within a group facilitate the tracing of their spread.
effects of moderate endurance exercise and training on in vitro lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-2 (il-2) production, and il-2 receptor expression this study was designed to examine cytokine production in a group of 22 well-trained runners covering a distance of 20 km within 2 hr. after running, all participants displayed a marked granulocytosis for 7 hr. plasma neopterin levels increased 1 hr after exercise for 24 hr. except for interleukin-6 (il-6), cytokines were not reliably detected in plasma but were present in urine. already before exercise, cytokines were detected in the urine of runners when compared to sedentary controls. directly after running, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were further elevated but rapidly declined to preexercise levels. interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 increased at a slower rate after exercise but secretion into urine persisted longer until 12 and 7 hr, respectively. interleukin-2 (il-2) was not detected but soluble il-2 receptors appeared in the urine directly after running. enhanced cytokine levels were accompanied by an only low creatinin kinase increase, indicating little muscle damage. these data show that long-distance running elevates cytokine production which supports the concept that regular, but not excessive, physical exercise may be beneficial by maintaining a stimulated immune system.
the load of short telomeres, estimated by a new method, universal stela, correlates with number of senescent cells human diploid fibroblast cells cease growth in culture after a finite number of population doublings. to address the cause of growth cessation in senescent imr-90 human fibroblast cells, we determined the level of oxidative dna damage by using 8-oxoguanine excised from dna and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in dna as markers. senescent cells excise from dna four times more 8-oxoguanine per day than do early-passage young cells. the steady-state level of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in dna is approximately 35% higher in senescent cells than in young cells. measurement of protein carbonyls shows that senescent cells did not appear to have elevated protein oxidation. to reduce the level of oxidative damage, we cultured cells under a more physiological o2 concentration (3%) and compared the replicative life span to the cells cultured at the o2 concentration of air (20%). we found that cells grown under 3% o2 achieved 50% more population doublings during their lifetime. such an extension of life span resulted from the delayed onset of senescence and elevation of growth rate and saturation density of cells at all passages. the spin-trapping agent alpha-phenyl-t-butyl nitrone (pbn), which can act as an antioxidant, also effectively delayed senescence and rejuvenated near senescent cells. the effect is dose-dependent and is most pronounced for cells at the stage just before entry into senescence. our data support the hypothesis that oxidative dna damage contributes to replicative cessation in human diploid fibroblast cells.
relationship between body mass index and adiposity in prepubertal children: ethnic and geographic comparisons between new york city and jinan city (china). objectives to test the hypothesis that in a healthy pediatric population body mass index (bmi) (kilograms per meter square) is a valid measure of fatness that is independent of age for both sexes.   methods total body fat (tbf) (in kilograms) and percent of body weight as fat (pbf) were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) in 198 healthy italian children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age. we developed multiple regression analysis models with tbf and percent body fat as dependent variables and bmi, age, and interaction terms as independent variables. separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls.   results bmi was strongly associated with tbf (r2 = 0.85 and 0.89 for boys and girls, respectively) and pbf (r2 =0.63 and 0.69 for boys and girls, respectively). confidence limits on bmi-fatness association were wide, with individuals of similar bmi showing large differences in tbf and in pbf. age was a significant covariate in all regression models. addition of nonlinear terms for bmi did not substantially increase the r2 for tbf and pbf models in boys and girls.   conclusion our results support the use of bmi as a fatness measure in groups of children and adolescents, although interpretation should be cautious when comparing bmi across groups that differ in age or when predicting a specific individual's tbf or pbf.
comparison of a laboratory grade force platform with a nintendo wii balance board on measurement of postural control in single-leg stance balance tasks. biomedical sciences rely heavily on devices to acquire and analyze the physiological data needed to understand and model the biological processes of humans and animals. therefore, the results of the investigations, clinical or academic, depend heavily on the instrumentation used. unfortunately, all too often the users do not understand their instruments and end up compromising the results of their investigations by choosing an inadequate instrument or by not using it appropriately. one field where this is particularly apparent is posturography: the misconceptions about instruments are so widespread and deep that just recently there have been articles published in scientific journals suggesting the use of a toy, the nintendo wii balance board, instead of instrument grade force platform to acquire posturographic data. characterizing the tools used for research becomes the first and probably the most important step in producing sound research and clinical results, and in the case of posturographic force platforms and the nintendo wii balance board a simple experimental setup can be used to find their characteristics. furthermore, based on the preliminary results of this investigation, a mathematical formula can be used to predict the behavior of a posturographic tool, once its noise characteristics and dead weight response are known.
effects of sleep deprivation on nocturnal cytokine concentrations in depressed patients and healthy control subjects. objective one night of sleep deprivation induces a transient improvement in about 60% of depressed patients. since depression is associated with abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, the authors measured cortisol secretion before, during, and after therapeutic sleep deprivation for 1 night.   method fifteen unmedicated depressed inpatients participated in a combined polysomnographic and endocrine study. blood was sampled at 30-minute intervals during 3 consecutive nights before, during, and after sleep deprivation. saliva samples were collected at 30-minute intervals during the daytime before and after the sleep deprivation night.   results during the night of sleep deprivation, cortisol levels were significantly higher than at baseline. during the daytime, cortisol levels during the first half of the day were higher than at baseline in the patients who responded to sleep deprivation but not in the nonresponders. during recovery sleep, cortisol secretion returned to baseline values.   conclusions this study demonstrated a significant stimulatory effect of 1 night of sleep deprivation on the hpa axis in unmedicated depressed patients. the results suggest that the short-term effects of antidepressant treatments on the hpa axis may differ from their long-term effects. a higher cortisol level after sleep deprivation might transiently improve negative feedback to the hypothalamus or interact with other neurotransmitter systems, thus mediating or contributing to the clinical response. the fast return to baseline values coincides with the short clinical effect.
the basophil surface marker cd203c identifies aspergillus species sensitization in patients with cystic fibrosis. background cystic fibrosis (cf) is the most common life threatening autosomal recessive disorder in the white population. wasting has long been recognised as a poor prognostic marker in cf. whether it predicts survival independently of lung function and arterial blood gas tensions has not previously been reported. methods 584 patients with cf (261 women) of mean (sd) age 21 (7) years were studied between 1985 and 1996, all of whom were being followed up in a tertiary referral centre. lung function tests, body weight, arterial blood oxygen (pao 2) and carbon dioxide (paco 2) tensions were measured. the weight was calculated as a percentage of the ideal body weight for age, height, and sex. results forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) recorded at the start of the study was 1.8 (1.0) l (52 (26)% predicted fev1), pao 2 9.8 (1.9) kpa, paco 2 5.0 (0.9) kpa, and % ideal weight 92 (18)%. during the follow up period (45 (27) months) 137 patients died (5 year survival 72%, 95% ci 67 to 73). fev1, % predicted fev1, pao 2, % ideal weight (all p<0.0001), and paco 2 (p=0.04) predicted survival. in multivariate analysis, % predicted fev1 (p<0.0001), % ideal weight (p=0.004), and paco 2 (p=0.02) were independent predictors of outcome. patients with >85% ideal body weight had a better prognosis at 5 years (cumulative survival 84%, 95% ci 79 to 89) than those with ⩽85% ideal weight (survival 53%, 95% ci 45 to 62), p<0.0001. percentage predicted fev1 (area under curve 0.83; 95% ci 0.78 to 0.87) and % ideal weight (area under curve 0.74; 95% ci 0.68 to 0.79) were accurate predictors of survival at 5 years follow up (receiver-operating characteristic analysis). conclusions body wasting is a significant predictor of survival in patients with cf independent of lung function, arterial blood oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions.
the prevalence of underweight, overweight, obesity and associated risk factors among school-going adolescents in seven african countries this paper describes the first african experience with the nutrition-friendly school initiative (nfsi) in two large west african cities: ouagadougou, burkina faso and cotonou, benin. nfsi was launched by the world health organization (who) and its partners in 2006, as a means of preventing the double burden of malnutrition: the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition among school-children. nfsi pilot-testing is one component of the partnership project on the double burden of malnutrition, funded by the canadian international development agency for 6 years (2008–2014). the project assisted the government in the selection of pilot schools, fostered the installation of health and nutrition committees in selected schools, and helped with the initial school self-assessments. in accordance with the empowering philosophy of health promotion, pilot schools did not follow a pre-defined schedule of interventions, except for the training of teachers in nutrition education and the nutritional (anthropometric) surveillance of schoolchildren. for the latter activities, technical assistance and seminal funds were provided. yearly planning workshops were held for school committees, with who support. in both settings, training was given to street vendors in order to improve the hygiene and nutritional value of food sold to schoolchildren. other activities included special nutrition events and sanitation measures. in both cities, nfsi showed promising results in terms of school and community mobilization towards improved nutrition and health; however, nfsi must be better understood as an endogenous and self-sustaining approach. furthermore, household poverty and scarce school resources appear as major barriers to gaining full impact of nfsi in low-income populations.

the role of n-glycosylation in folding, trafficking, and functionality of lysosomal protein cln5 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ncls) represent a group of children's inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in at least eight different genes. mutations in the cln5 gene result in the finnish variant late infantile ncl characterized by gradual loss of vision, epileptic seizures, and mental deterioration. the cln5 gene encodes a lysosomal glycoprotein of unidentified function. in this study, we have used both transient and stable expression systems for the characterization of cln5, focusing on the localization, processing, and intracellular trafficking. we show that cln5 is proteolytically cleaved, and that the mature polypeptide is transported to the lysosomes. our data provide the first evidence that soluble cln5 protein can also undergo mannose‐6‐phosphate receptor‐independent trafficking to the lysosomes. we studied the localization and maturation of the cln5 carrying the previously uncharacterized vlincl disease causing mutations in hela cells. all analyzed disease mutations disturb the lysosomal trafficking of the mutated cln5 proteins. the level of lysosomal targeting does not correlate, however, to disease onset, indicating that cln5 may also function outside lysosomes. this study furthers our understanding of the basic properties of the cln5 protein, necessary for the characterization of the consequences of disease mutations and for the planning of future therapies for vlincl. hum mutat 31:356–365, 2010. © 2010 wiley‐liss, inc.

comparison of a textual versus a graphical notation for the maintainability of mde domain models: an empirical pilot study as modeling becomes a crucial activity in software develop- ment the question may be asked whether currently used graphical repre- sentations are the best option to model systems eciently. this position paper discusses the advantages of text-based modeling over commonly used graphical representations. it is inspired through the advent of new extensible development tools like eclipse. the discussion is illustrated by showing a textual version of uml state machines as eclipse plugins.
salvage brachytherapy in prostate local recurrence after radiation therapy: predicting factors for control and toxicity purpose we describe the treatment outcome in 17 patients who received combined salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy for local prostate cancer relapse after prior external beam irradiation.   materials and methods median patient age was 68 years. local relapse after external beam irradiation was confirmed by biopsy. median prostate specific antigen at local relapse was 4.7 ng/ml. five of the 17 patients were enrolled in a protocol combining androgen deprivation therapy with brachytherapy and the remaining men were treated off protocol. all patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for a median of 3 months, followed by ultrasound guided brachytherapy using 125i in 9 and 103pd seeds in 8. five patients also received adjuvant leuprolide for a median of 6 months. biochemical failure was defined using the american society for therapeutic radiology and oncology definition. toxicity was graded with a modified radiation therapy oncology group scale.   results median followup was 44 months. the actuarial 4-year biochemical control rate was 75%. three patients died of intercurrent diseases. no prostate cancer mortality or local failure had occurred at last followup. one patient had bone metastasis. no clinical or treatment factor was associated with biochemical control. grade 3 and 4 genitourinary toxicity developed in 7 (41%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively. grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (29%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively.   conclusions our series suggests that salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy can achieve biochemical control in select patients with local relapse after prior external beam irradiation. the major side effects are urinary complications, including grade 3 and 4 complications in 41% and 6% of cases, respectively.
discrepancy in expression of β-secretase and amyloid-β protein precursor in alzheimer-related genes in the rat medial temporal lobe cortex following transient global brain ischemia. there is increasing evidence for influence of alzheimer's proteins and neuropathology on ischemic brain injury. this review investigates the relationships between β‐amyloid peptide, apolipoproteins, presenilins, tau protein, α‐synuclein, inflammation factors, and neuronal survival/death decisions in brain following ischemic episode. the interactions of these molecules and influence on β‐amyloid peptide synthesis and contribution to ischemic brain degeneration and finally to dementia are reviewed. generation and deposition of β‐amyloid peptide and tau protein pathology are important key players involved in mechanisms in ischemic neurodegeneration as well as in alzheimer's disease. current evidence suggests that inflammatory process represents next component, which significantly contribute to degeneration progression. although inflammation was initially thought to arise secondary to ischemic neurodegeneration, recent studies present that inflammatory mediators may stimulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism by upregulation of β‐secretase and therefore are able to establish a vicious cycle. functional brain recovery after ischemic lesion was delayed and incomplete by an injury‐related increase in the amount of the neurotoxic c‐terminal of amyloid precursor protein and β‐amyloid peptide. moreover, ischemic neurodegeneration is strongly accelerated with aging, too. new therapeutic alternatives targeting these proteins and repairing related neuronal changes are under development for the treatment of ischemic brain consequences including memory loss prevention. anat rec, 292:1863–1881, 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
combinatorial gene regulatory functions underlie ultraconserved elements in drosophila identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. one major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. in this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human–pufferfish, takifugu (fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human–mouse–rat. we tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. while directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. we identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all ∼3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and fugu. the testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. these data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.
outcome of microdissection tese compared with conventional tese in non‐obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
illness, medical expenditure and household consumption: observations from taiwan background the main goal of this study is to examine the associations between illness conditions and out-of-pocket medical expenditure with other types of household consumptions. in november and december of 2011, a survey was conducted in three cities in western china, namely lan zhou, gui lin and xi an, and their surrounding rural areas. results information on demographics, income and consumption was collected on 2,899 households. data analysis suggested that the presence of household members with chronic diseases was not associated with characteristics of households or household heads. the presence of inpatient treatments was significantly associated with the age of household head (p-value 0.03). the level of per capita medical expense was significantly associated with household size, presence of members younger than 18, older than 65, basic health insurance coverage, per capita income, and household head occupation. adjusting for confounding effects, the presence of chronic diseases was negatively associated with the amount of basic consumption (p-value 0.02) and the percentage of basic consumption (p-value 0.01), but positively associated with the percentage of insurance expense (p-value 0.02). medical expenditure was positively associated with all other types of consumptions, including basic, education, saving and investment, entertainment, insurance, durable goods, and alcohol/tobacco. it was negatively associated with the percentage of basic consumption, saving and investment, and insurance. conclusions early studies conducted in other asian countries and rural china found negative associations between illness conditions and medical expenditure with other types of consumptions. this study was conducted in three major cities and surrounding areas in western china, which had not been well investigated in published literature. the observed consumption patterns were different from those in early studies, and the negative associations were not observed. this study may complement the existing rural studies and provide useful information on western chinese cities.
the role of ocular perfusion pressure in glaucoma cannot be studied with multivariable regression analysis applied to surrogates. purpose. to assess the distribution of the 24-hour intraocular pressure (iop) in subjects with primary openangle glaucoma (poag) in a population-based study in rural west bengal. methods. all untreated poag patients (n = 132) identified by a door to door survey in the hugli district of west bengal were invited to attend a follow-up study in which iop was tested with a goldmann applanation tonometer at 10 am, 1 pm, 4 pm, 7pm, 10 pm, 1 am, and 6 am. results. 72 subjects with untreated poag (72/132; 88.6%) attended the study. of them, 59 (83.0%) had a peak iop ≤ 21 mm hg. the peak iop (mean ± sd) was 16.4 ± 4.2 mm hg. peak iop occurred in early morning in approximately 78.5% of the subjects (6 am to 10 am), and the trough occurred during night time in 72.2% of the subjects (10 pm to 1 am). the 24-hour iop (mean ± sd) was 14.2 ± 4.4 mm hg and the mean fluctuation was 4.0 ± 6.8 mm hg (range, 2–11 mm hg). in the 32 persons with unilateral glaucoma, no significant differences were found in mean 24-hour iop, peak iop, trough iop, or iop fluctuation when comparing the glaucomatous eye with the non glaucomatous eye (p > 0.05). conclusions. twenty-four–hour iop was similar between glaucomatous and controls (contralateral nonglaucomatous) eyes suggesting that factors other than iop may play a role in the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in these eyes.
5-hydroxytryptamine 2 receptors modulate auditory filtering in the rat 1 because of its close clinical similarity to acute paranoid schizophrenia, amphetamine psychosis may serve as a useful experimental model for schizophrenia. molecular and clinical studies suggest that both the schizophrenia-like symptoms of amphetamine psychosis and the specific ability of phenothiazines to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia and amphetamine psychosis may be the result of interactions with dopamine systems in the brain. the author discusses some implications of the roles dopamine and norepinephrine may play in mediating some schizophrenic symptoms.
life in the fat lane: seasonal regulation of insulin sensitivity, food intake, and adipose biology in brown bears grizzly bears (ursus arctos horribilis) are inactive for up to 6 months during hibernation. they undergo profound seasonal changes in food intake, body mass, and energy expenditure. the circa-annual regulation of metabolism is poorly understood. in this study, we measured plasma ghrelin, leptin, obestatin, and neuropeptide-y (npy) levels, hormones known to be involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, in ten grizzly bears. blood samples were collected during the active summer period, early hibernation and late hibernation. plasma levels of leptin, obestatin, and npy did not change between the active and the hibernation periods. plasma total ghrelin and desacyl-ghrelin concentrations significantly decreased during the inactive winter period compared to summer levels. the elevated ghrelin levels may help enhance body mass during pre-hibernation, while the low plasma ghrelin concentrations during hibernation season may contribute to the maintenance of hypophagia, low energy utilization and behavioral inactivity. our results suggest that ghrelin plays a potential role in the regulation of metabolic changes and energy homeostasis during hibernation in grizzly bears.
the efficacy and safety of 5 mg/d vortioxetine compared to placebo for major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis abstract objective: vortioxetine (lu aa21004) is an investigational antidepressant. in vitro studies indicate that vortioxetine is a 5-ht3, 5-ht7, and 5-ht1d receptor antagonist, 5-ht1b receptor partial agonist, 5-ht1a receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-ht transporter. this trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of 2.5 and 5 mg vortioxetine for the treatment of mdd. research design and methods: adults (n = 611) with mdd were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo, vortioxetine (2.5 or 5 mg) or active reference (duloxetine 60 mg). the primary measure was change from baseline in the 24-item hamilton depression scale (ham-d24). secondary endpoints included responder rate, clinical global impression scale-global improvement scale (cgi-i), and remission rate. participants were monitored for adverse events (aes), and treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction using the arizona sexual experiences (asex) scale. results: both doses of vortioxetine were associated with declines in ham-d24 total scores compared to placebo but were not statistically significant. at 8 weeks, changes from baseline were [mean (se)]: −10.50 (0.76) placebo, −12.04 (0.74) 2.5 mg vortioxetine, and −11.08 (0.74) 5 mg vortioxetine. secondary outcome measures in the vortioxetine groups, including responder rate, cgi-i, and remission rate, were also not significantly different from placebo. duloxetine treatment was associated with declines in ham-d24 total score [−13.47(0.75); p = 0.005] as well as significant improvements in secondary outcome measures versus placebo (p ≤ 0.05). the most common aes for vortioxetine were nausea, dry mouth, and headache. rates of sexual dysfunction (asex) were 51.0%, 37.5%, 46.9%, and 33.3% in the vortioxetine 2.5 mg, vortioxetine 5 mg, duloxetine, and placebo groups, respectively. conclusions: in this study of adults with mdd treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5 mg or 5 mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo. study limitations are discussed, including patient characteristics, mdd severity, drug dosing, and aspects of trial design. both doses of vortioxetine were well tolerated. this trial has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov #nct00672620
brief report: a comparison of statistical learning in school-aged children with high functioning autism and typically developing peers joint attention abilities play a crucial role in the development of autism. impairments in joint attention are among the earliest signs of the disorder and joint attention skills relate to outcome, both in the 'natural course' of autism and through being targeted in early intervention programmes. in the current study, concurrent and longitudinal associations between joint attention and other social communication abilities measured in a sample of infants with autism and related pervasive developmental disorders at age 20 months, and language and symptom severity at age 42 months, were examined. extending the findings from previous studies, joint attention ability was positively associated with language gains and (lower) social and communication symptoms, and imitation ability was also positively associated with later language. some specificity in the association between different aspects of joint attention behaviours and outcome was found: declarative, triadic gaze switching predicted language and symptom severity but imperative, dyadic eye contact behaviours did not. further, although joint attention was associated with later social and language symptoms it was unrelated to repetitive and stereotyped symptoms, suggesting the latter may have a separate developmental trajectory. possible deficits in psychological and neurological processes that might underlie the impaired development of joint attention in autism are discussed.
validation of knowledge and adherence assessment tools among patients on warfarin therapy in a saudi hospital anticoagulant clinic objective to evaluate patients’ knowledge of warfarin and its relationship to anticoagulation control. methods from january to march 1999, 122 patients attending the warfarin clinic of the prince of wales hospital in hong kong were interviewed. their knowledge of warfarin therapy and adherence to medical advice were tested by 9 questions. a score (maximum 1.0) was calculated for each patient. the number of international normalized ratios (inrs) that was within the target range in the 4 most recent clinic visits was noted. results fifty-six men and 66 women participated in the study (mean ± sd age 58.0 ± 13.0, duration of treatment 43.1 ± 39.8 mo). patients’ warfarin knowledge was poor, with an overall score of 0.48 ± 0.18. participants generally knew the colors of their warfarin tablets and took them regularly. they almost always informed their physicians and dentists of their warfarin therapy. only 40–45% of patients knew the strengths of their warfarin tablets, the reason for taking warfarin, and its effect on the body. their deficiencies in knowledge were even more obvious with respect to the possible consequences of under- or over-anticoagulation, drugs and medicated oils that might interact with warfarin, and management of a missed dose. knowledge was related to age (r −0.43; p < 0.001) and duration of therapy (r 0.18; p = 0.044). sixty patients (49.2%) had read the information booklet on warfarin and had better knowledge than those who had not (0.53 ± 0.20 vs. 0.42 ± 0.20; p < 0.001). illiteracy was the main reason for not reading the booklet. there was a positive correlation between patients’ warfarin knowledge and the number of inr values that was within the target range in the 4 most recent clinic visits (r 0.20; p = 0.024). conclusions patients’ warfarin knowledge, a determinant of anticoagulation control, was generally poor. more attention should be given to the education of elderly and illiterate patients.
association of serum adipocytokine levels with cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 diabetic patients abstract—results from animal experimentation suggest a 2-way interaction between leptin and the sympathetic nervous system, with leptin causing sympathetic activation and conversely, with the sympathetic system exercising regulatory feedback inhibition over leptin release. we have now tested this hypothesis in humans. in the absence of results from leptin infusions, to test for sympathetic stimulation of leptin release, we sought a quantitative naturalistic linkage of sympathetic activity with leptin plasma concentration across a broad range of leptin values in men of widely differing adiposity. renal norepinephrine spillover was correlated with plasma leptin (r =0.628, p <0.01), but other measures of sympathoadrenal function did not. to test for sympathetic and adrenomedullary inhibition of leptin release, we studied clinical models of high sympathetic tone, heart failure, and essential hypertension, in which lowered plasma leptin levels might have been expected but were not found; a model of low sympathetic activity, pure autonomic failure, in which plasma leptin level was normal (6.1±1.2 vs 12.8±3.1 ng/ml in healthy subjects); and a clinical model of reduced epinephrine secretion, healthy aging, in which plasma leptin level again was normal (5.7±1.1 ng/ml vs 4.0±0.9 ng/ml in men >60 years and <35 years, respectively). paradoxically, leptin concentration was elevated in heart failure, caused entirely by reduced renal clearance of leptin release, 142.0±30.5 ml/min, compared with 56.9±18.9 ml/min (p <0.05). these results provide some support for the view that leptin stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, at least for renal sympathetic outflow, but do not confirm the concept of regulatory feedback inhibition of leptin release by the sympathetic nervous system.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
truncated type xvii collagen expression in a patient with non-herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa caused by a homozygous splice-site mutation recent biochemical studies have shown that the fibroblasts from a patient with ehlers-danlos syndrome type viib produce nearly equal amounts of normal and shortened pro-alpha 2(i) collagen chains (wirtz, m.k., glanville, r. w., steinmann, b., rao, v. h., and hollister, d. (1987) j. biol. chem. 262, 16376-16385). compositional and sequencing studies of the abnormal pro-alpha 2(i) chain identified an interstitial deletion of 18 residues corresponding to the n-telopeptide of the collagen molecule. since this region is encoded by a 54-base pair exon, number 6, the protein defect could have been caused by gene deletion, abnormal pre-mrna splicing, or both. here, in order to elucidate the molecular nature of this mutation we have analyzed the sequences of pro-alpha 2(i) collagen cdna and genomic clones obtained from rna and dna of the patient's fibroblasts. using oligomer-specific cloning we identified a cdna that contains a 54-base pair deletion corresponding precisely to the sequence of exon 6. identification of the normal gene was based on the finding of an identical sequence polymorphism in a normal cdna and in the genomic clone derived from one of the two collagen alleles. the other gene, instead, displayed a base substitution (t to c) in the obligatory gt dinucleotide of the 5' splice-site sequence of intron 6. analysis of nearly 100 base pairs immediately 5' to exons 5, 6, and 7, and 3' to exons 5 and 7 did not reveal any additional change. therefore, the data strongly suggest that the observed gt-to-gc transition at the splice donor site of intron 6 generates an abnormally spliced mrna in which the sequence of exon 5 is joined to the sequence of exon 7. since skipping of exon 6 does not interfere with the coding frame of the mrna, the resulting shortened polypeptide, albeit utilized in the assembly of a procollagen trimer, ultimately causes the ehlers-danlos syndrome type vii phenotype.
ontology-based web site mapping for information exploration recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as c4.5. this fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. in this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning bayesian networks. these networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. among these approaches we single out a method we call tree augmented naive bayes (tan), which outperforms naive bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive bayes. we experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the university of california at irvine repository, and compared them to c4.5, naive bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection.
brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and depression during methamphetamine withdrawal. during brain development, neural precursor cells migrate along radial glial fibers to populate the neocortex. rna interference (rnai) of the lissencephaly gene lis1 (also known as pafah1b1) inhibits somal movement but not process extension of neural precursors in live brain slices. here we report imaging of the subcellular events accompanying neural precursor migration and the effects of lis1, cytoplasmic dynein and myosin ii inhibition. centrosomes move continuously and often far in advance of nuclei, which show extreme saltatory behavior. lis1 and dynein rnai inhibit centrosomal and nuclear movement independently, whereas myosin ii inhibition blocks only nuclear translocation. imaging of the microtubule end-binding protein 3 (eb3) reveals a centrosome-centered array of microtubules in live neural precursors under all conditions examined. dynein is concentrated both at a swelling in the leading process reported to initiate each migratory cycle and in the soma. thus, dynein pulls on the microtubule network from the swelling. the nucleus is transported along the trailing microtubules by dynein assisted by myosin ii.
on the biodegradability, mechanical behavior, and cytocompatibility of amorphous mg72 zn23 ca5 and crystalline mg70 zn23 ca5 pd2 alloys as temporary implant materials. certain dental alloys have been claimed to cause gingival and periodontal inflammation. however, little information is available on the molecules mediating the mechanism of such an effect. recently, a three-dimensional cell culture system consisting of human fibroblasts and keratinocytes has been introduced for evaluating the irritancy of cosmetic products, including the analysis of inflammatory mediators. in the present study the influence of pure metals and a high noble dental cast alloy upon cell viability and the synthesis of the proinflammatory mediator interleukin-6 was recorded in this in vitro skin equivalent model. the cultures were exposed to test specimens fabricated from copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, palladium, tin, indium, a high noble cast alloy and a dental ceramic. cell vitality was reduced after a 24 h exposure to copper (14-25% of untreated controls), cobalt (60%), zinc (63%), indium (85%), nickel (87%), and the heat treated and not heat treated high noble cast alloy (87%/90%). dental ceramic, palladium and tin did not influence cell viability. increased il-6 levels were observed in cultures exposed to copper (5-19-fold compared to untreated controls), zinc (16-fold), cobalt (12-fold), nickel (10-fold) and palladium (4-fold). other materials tested produced il-6 levels comparable to those of untreated controls. our findings suggest that metal ions are involved in proinflammatory activity at low toxicity and non-toxic levels as assessed by different biological endpoints.
the effect of compressed speech on the ability of right-hemisphere-damaged patients to use context the ability of right-brain-damaged (rbd) patients to use on-line contextual information in a word-monitoring task was examined. subjects were required to monitor for target words in the contexts of both normal and semantically anomalous sentences. similar to previous studies with normals (e.g., marslen-wilson & tyler, 1980), the semantic integrity of the context was influential in the word-recognition process. importantly, the rbd patients performed similarly to normals in showing context effects. these results were interpreted as substantiating the findings of leonard, waters, and caplan (1997a, 1997b) that rbd patients do not present with a specific deficit in the use of contextual information. the results are discussed in terms of proposals that suggest that an impaired ability to use contextual information by rbd patients may be a function of increased processing demands.
il28b gene polymorphism rs12979860, but not rs8099917, contributes to the occurrence of chronic hcv infection in uruguayan patients background: about 30% of individuals with hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection are able to clear hcv spontaneously. differences in host genetics affect the outcome of hcv infection. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of the interferon lambda (ifnl) genes were associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of hcv infection. objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the ifnl4 rs12979860 snp and spontaneous clearance of hcv infection in iranian population. materials and methods: a case-control study was designed on 91 cases with spontaneous hcv infection clearance and 259 patients with persistent hcv infection as the control group. the rs12979860 snp was assessed as the most common ifnl polymorphism by pcr-rflp method. results: distribution of rs12979860 cc genotype in the spontaneous clearance group was around two folds of its distribution in chronic hepatitis c group (p < 0.001, or = 4.09, 95% ci = 2.44-6.86). conclusions: the rs12979860 snp was observed as a strong host genetic factor associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis c infection.
epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr )-targeted immunoliposomes mediate specific and efficient drug delivery to egfr-and egfrviii-overexpressing tumor cells 1 purpose anti-her2 immunoliposomes combine the tumor-targeting of certain anti-her2 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) with the pharmacokinetic and drug delivery capabilities of sterically stabilized liposomes. we previously showed that anti-her2 immunoliposomes bind efficiently to and internalize in her2-overexpressing cells in vitro, resulting in intracellular drug delivery.   experimental design here we describe the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of anti-her2 immunoliposomes containing doxorubicin (dox) in a series of animal models.   results immunoliposomes displayed long circulation that was identical to that of sterically stabilized liposomes in single- and multiple-dose studies in normal rats. anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox produced marked therapeutic results in four different her2-overexpressing tumor xenograft models, including growth inhibition, regression, and cures. these results demonstrated that encapsulation of dox in anti-her2 immunoliposomes greatly increased its therapeutic index, both by increasing antitumor efficacy and by reducing systemic toxicity. immunoliposome-dox was significantly superior to all other treatment conditions tested, including free dox, liposomal dox, and anti-her2 mab (trastuzumab). when compared with liposomal dox in eight separate therapy studies in her2-overexpressing models, immunoliposome delivery produced significantly superior antitumor efficacy in each study (p < 0.0001 to 0.04). anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox containing either recombinant human mab her2-fab' or scfv c6.5 yielded comparable therapeutic efficacy. cure rates for immunoliposome-dox reached 50% (11 of 21) with optimized immunoliposomes and matrigel-free tumors and overall was 16% (18 of 115) versus no cures (0 of 124) with free dox or liposomal dox. finally, anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox was also superior to combinations consisting of free mab plus free dox or free mab plus liposomal dox.   conclusions anti-her2 immunoliposomes produced enhanced antitumor efficacy via targeted delivery.
the effect of various forms of selenium supplied to pregnant goats on selected blood parameters and on the concentration of se in urine and blood of kids at the time of weaning the aim of this trial was to compare the effect of long-term supplementation of goats with different forms of selenium on body reserves of selenium in their kids at the time of weaning. thirty-three pregnant goats were divided into five groups. group c was control while the other four groups were supplemented with selenium (se) for 6 weeks before parturition (0.3 mg/goat/day) and after parturition (0.9 mg/goat/day). group “se-i” received sodium selenite and three other groups received organic forms: “se-l,” lactate–protein complex; “se-p,” se-proteinate; and “se-y,” se-yeast. the kids were weaned at 3 months of age and samples of tissues (liver, pancreas, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, spleen, thigh, tongue, and diaphragm) were taken after slaughtering. the long-term supplementation of goats with se influenced se concentration in all examined tissues of kids. significant differences (p ≤ 0.01) were found between the control and all experimental groups, except for the renal cortex and pancreas (se-i). the average increase of se concentration in overall examined tissues in comparison with the control (100%) was as follows: se-y, 192%; se-p, 167%; se-l, 161%; se-i, 144%. the highest efficiency was found in the group supplemented with se-yeast with a high content of selenomethionine, also the other two organic forms of se were more efficient than the inorganic form.
the effects of systemic and intracerebral injections of d1 and d2 agonists on brain stimulation reward the conditioned place preference technique was used to assess the affective properties of the direct dopamine d1 agonist, skf38393, and the direct d2 agonist, ly171555 (quinpirole). a three compartment apparatus was used: the animals' pre-experimental preference for the two choice compartments was equal and, within each experimental group, half the rats received drug pairings in each choice compartment. intraperitoneal injections of skf38393 produced conditioned place aversions at all doses tested (1.0–4.0 mg/kg); ly171555 produced weak conditioned place preferences at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, but no reliable effect at 4.0 mg/kg. bilateral intra-accumbens microinjections of skf38393 produced strong preferences at all doses tested (0.5–2.0 µg/side); ly171555 produced strong preferences at two doses (0.5 and 1.0 µg/side) and no effect at a third dose (2.0 µg/side). these results suggest that activation of either d1 or d2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens can produce reward, and that d1 receptors (and possibly also d2 receptors) located elsewhere in the brain or in the periphery may mediate aversive effects.
trends in type 2 diabetes incidence and mortality in scotland between 2004 and 2013 objective with improvements in cardiovascular disease (cvd) rates among people with diabetes, mortality rates may also be changing. however, these trends may be influenced by coding practices of cvd-related deaths on death certificates. we analyzed trends of mortality over 13 years in people with diabetes and quantified the potential misclassification of cvd mortality according to current coding methods. research design and methods a total of 1,136,617 australians with diabetes registered on the national diabetes services scheme between 1997 and 2010 were linked to the national death index. excess mortality relative to the australian population was reported as standardized mortality ratios (smrs). potential misclassification of cvd mortality was determined by coding cvd according to underlying cause of death (cod) and then after consideration of both the underlying and other causes listed in part i of the death certificate. results for type 1 diabetes, the smr decreased in males from 4.20 in 1997 to 3.08 in 2010 (ptrend < 0.001) and from 3.92 to 3.46 in females (ptrend < 0.01). for type 2 diabetes, the smr decreased in males from 1.40 to 1.21 (ptrend < 0.001) and from 1.56 to 1.22 in females (ptrend < 0.001). cvd deaths decreased from 35.6 to 31.2% and from 31.5 to 27.2% in males and females with type 1 diabetes, respectively (ptrend < 0.001 for both sexes). for type 2 diabetes, cvd decreased from 44.5 to 29.2% in males and from 45.5 to 31.6% in females (ptrend < 0.001 for both sexes). using traditional coding methods, ∼38 and 26% of cvd deaths are underestimated in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. conclusions all-cause and cvd mortality has decreased in diabetes. however, the total cvd mortality burden is underestimated when only underlying cod is considered. this has important ramifications for understanding mortality patterns in diabetes.
biometric-oriented iris identification based on mathematical morphology algorithms first described in 1993 for recognizing persons by their iris patterns have now been tested in several public field trials, producing no false matches in several million comparison tests. the underlying recognition principle is the failure of a test of statistical independence on texture phase structure as encoded by multi-scale quadrature wavelets. the combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 244 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 bits/mm2 over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. this paper reviews the current algorithms and presents the results of 2.3 million comparisons among eye images acquired in trials in britain, the usa, and japan, and it discusses aspects of the process still in need of improvement.
supplementary materials and methods the development of the segmented pharyngeal apparatus involves complex interaction of tissues derived from all three germ layers. the role of mesoderm is the least studied, perhaps because of its apparent lack of anatomical boundaries and positionally restricted gene expression. here, we report that the mesoderm-specific deletion of tbx1, a t-box transcription factor, caused severe pharyngeal patterning and cardiovascular defects, while mesoderm-specific restoration of tbx1 expression in a mutant background corrected most of those defects in the mouse. we show that some organs, e.g. the thymus, require tbx1 expression in the mesoderm and in the epithelia. in addition, these experiments revealed that different pharyngeal arches require tbx1 in different tissues. finally, we show that tbx1 in the mesoderm is required to sustain cell proliferation. thus, the mesodermal transcription program is not only crucial for cardiovascular development, but is also key in the development and patterning of pharyngeal endoderm.
light-dependent and light-independent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases share similar sequence motifs —in silico studies light-dependent nadph-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (lpor) is a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein in green algae and higher plants which catalyzes the light-dependent reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide. light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis occurs in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. with the exception of angiosperms, this pathway coexists with a separate light-independent chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, which is catalyzed by light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase (dpor) in the dark. in contrast, the light-dependent function of chlorophyll biosynthesis is absent from anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. consequently, the question is whether cyanobacteria are the ancestors of all organisms that conduct light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. if so, how did photosynthetic eukaryotes acquire the homologous genes of lpor in their nuclear genomes? the large number of complete genome sequences now available allow us to detect the evolutionary history of lpor genes by conducting a genome-wide sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. here, we show the results of a detailed phylogenetic analysis of lpor and other functionally related enzymes in the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (sdr) family. we propose that the lpor gene originated in the cyanobacterial genome before the divergence of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. we postulated that the photosynthetic eukaryotes obtained their lpor homologues through endosymbiotic gene transfer.
isolated myc cytogenetic abnormalities in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma do not predict an adverse clinical outcome purpose rearrangement of myc occurs in a proportion of diffuse large b-cell lymphomas (dlbcl), where they may be associated with an adverse clinical outcome. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of myc translocations in dlbcl and their prognostic impact in the era of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab (chop-r) therapy.   patients and methods three hundred three patients with previously untreated dlbcl, with no evidence of underlying follicular lymphoma, were investigated using immunohistochemistry and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization for myc, bcl6, and t(14;18)/bcl2 rearrangements. all patients (median age, 71.1 years; range, 23 to 96 years) were treated when chop-r was standard therapy for dlbcl and observed for a maximum of 4 years. overall survival (os) at 3 years was 49% (95% ci, 42% to 56%).   results myc rearrangements were demonstrated in 35 (14%) of 245 biopsies with data available. of these, 26 (74%) also had a t(14;18), 10 (26%) were bcl6 and myc rearranged, and seven had all three abnormalities. only age, international prognostic index, and myc rearrangement retained prognostic significance in the final model. os was significantly worse for patients with rearrangement of myc (survival probability at 2 years = 0.35 in v 0.61 in the nonrearranged group).   conclusion the presence of a myc rearrangement is a strongly adverse prognostic factor in chop-r-treated patients and can be used in combination with patients' age and ipi to accurately predict clinical outcome. in dlbcl, rearrangement of myc is rarely found as the sole genetic abnormality and the poor prognosis of these patients is likely to reflect a synergistic effect alongside deregulation of bcl6 or bcl2.
electrophysiological characterization of murine hl-5 atrial cardiomyocytes. acetylcholine (ach) decreased the contraction of rat ventricular cells within 20 s. ach (3.1 x 10(-8) m) produced a half-maximal effect and 10(-6) m ach produced a maximal effect (a 23.8 +/- 5.4% decrease; mean +/- se, n = 11). during a 3-min exposure to ach, the inotropic effect faded. parallel changes were observed in action potential duration: ach caused an immediate shortening of the action potential, but then the effect faded with time. the changes in action potential duration were the cause of the changes in contraction, because ach had no effect on contraction when the contractions were triggered by voltage-clamp pulses of constant duration. the changes in action potential duration were the result of the activation of a k+ current (ik,ach) by ach. during an exposure to ach, this current faded as a result of desensitization. ik,ach was 6.3 times smaller in ventricular than in atrial cells. this may explain why the negative inotropic effect of ach on atrial cells was greater: 1.0 x 10(-8) m ach produced a half-maximal effect on atrial cells, and 10(-6) m ach produced a near maximal effect (a 74.5 +/- 9.5% decrease; n = 4).
prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in an elderly population in nepal: the bhaktapur retina study background a national eye care programme was launched in nepal in the early 1980s. the impact of this programme on blindness and cataract surgery prevalence was evaluated in two geographic zones. methods people aged 45 years and older were sampled using a stratified cluster design. within randomly selected clusters, door to door enumeration was followed by visual acuity measurement and eye examinations at conveniently located sites. the full survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance measures carried out. results of the 5112 enumerated individuals 90% were examined. blindness, defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 in both eyes, was found in 5.3% (95% ci 3.6, 6.8) of individuals examined, with cataract being the principal cause in at least one eye in 78% of cases. considering both cataract operated and unoperated cataract blind cases, surgical coverage was approximately 42%. conclusion the findings suggest that blindness prevalence may have decreased slightly from that estimated in a 1981 national survey, both overall and cataract related. similarly, cataract surgical coverage may have increased somewhat. none of these changes, however, are at statistically significant levels. accordingly, the blindness problem remains challengingly high.
anti-yeast activity of a food-grade dilution-stable microemulsion some microemulsions and nanoemulsions may have antimicrobial properties and be effective anti-biofilm agents. we examined the abilities of two fine emulsions, designated bctp and teop, to inactivate suspensions of vegetative cells of salmonella spp. escherichia coli 0157:h7 (vt-), pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes. bctp is an o/w nanoemulsion of soybean oil and tri-n-butyl phosphate emulsified with triton x-100, while teop is an o/w microemulsion of ethyl oleate with tween 80 as emulsifier and n-pentanol as a co-emulsifier. bctp was effective in reducing the cell numbers of l. monocytogenes, while teop was effective against all five organisms investigated. the abilities of these emulsions to reduce preformed biofilms of the five bacteria were also investigated. with the exception of the biofilm formed by l. monocytogenes, which surprisingly was not significantly affected by bctp, all biofilms were inhibited by both bctp and teop.
role of aramchol in steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice hepatic metabolism of methionine is the source of cysteine, the precursor of glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant in the body. methionine also is the immediate precursor of sam (s-adenosylmethionine) the key methyl donor for phosphatidylcholine synthesis required for the export of vldl (very-low-density lipoprotein) triacylglycerols (triglycerides) from the liver. we have examined the kinetics of methionine, its transmethylation and trans-sulfuration with estimates of whole body rate of protein turnover and urea synthesis in clinically stable biopsy-confirmed subjects with nash (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). subjects with nash were more insulin-resistant and had significantly higher plasma concentrations of uscrp (ultrasensitive c-reactive protein), tnfα (tumour necrosis factor α) and other inflammatory cytokines. there was no significant effect of insulin resistance and nash on whole body rate of protein turnover [phenylalanine ra (rate of appearance)] and on the rate of urea synthesis. the rates of methylation of homocysteine and transmethylation of methionine were significantly lower in nash compared with controls. there was no difference in the rate of trans-sulfuration of methionine between the two groups. enteric mixed nutrient load resulted in a significant increase in all the measured parameters of methionine kinetics. heterozygosity for mthfr (5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase) (677c→t) did not have an impact on methionine metabolism. we speculate that, as a result of oxidant stress possibly due to high fatty acid oxidation, the activity of methionine adenosyltransferase is attenuated resulting in a lower rate of transmethylation of methionine and of sam synthesis. these results are the first evidence for perturbed metabolism of methionine in nash in humans and provide a rationale for the development of targeted intervention strategies.
neuropsychological perspectives on the mechanisms of imitation imitation is an important constituent of the behavioral repertoire of human beings. we use imitation for learning motor skills, for facilitating comprehension of other persons’ actions and mental states, and as a communicative reference to actions or people. although some non-human species display imitative behaviors, none of them equals the versatility and perfection of human imitation. the versatility and apparent ease of human imitation is, however, not at all self-evident when one considers the neural and cognitive transformations that must be accomplished for successful imitation. imitation of meaningless gestures poses a particular challenge for our brain, because similarity between the body of the model and one’s own body must bridge fundamental differences between the perspective and modalities of perceiving and controlling one’s own and other bodies. we analyzed the locations of left-hemisphere lesions disturbing imitation of meaningless gestures and found a clear-cut body part specificity. disturbed imitation of finger postures was associated with anterior lesions including the opercular portion of the inferior frontal gyrus, whereas disturbed imitation of hand postures was associated with posterior lesions affecting the inferior parietal lobule and temporo-parieto-occipital junction. these locations do not correspond with known somatotopic maps of motor representations. rather, they argue for an intermediate step of processing interpolated between perception and execution of gestures as has been suggested by the mirror neuron and the body part coding hypotheses.
diffusion‐weighted imaging in assessing pathological response of tumor in breast cancer subtype to neoadjuvant chemotherapy measurements of tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (adc), volume and diameter in assessing the response of patients with locally advanced breast cancer (labc) (n = 56) undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nact) at four time periods (before treatment and after three cycles of nact) were carried out at 1.5 t using diffusion‐weighted imaging (dwi) and mri. ten benign tumors and 15 controls were also investigated. the mr tumor response was compared with the clinical response. mean adc before treatment of malignant breast tissue was significantly lower than that of controls, disease‐free contralateral tissue of the patients, and benign lesions, and gradually increased during the course of nact. analysis of the percentage change in adc, volume and diameter after each cycle of nact between clinical responders and non‐responders showed that the change in adc after the first cycle was statistically significant compared with volume and diameter, indicating its potential in assessing early response. after the third cycle, the sensitivity for differentiating responders from non‐responders was 89% for volume and diameter and 68% for adc, and the respective specificities were 50%, 70% and 100%. a sensitivity of 84% (specificity of 60% with an accuracy of 76%) was achieved when all three variables were taken together to predict the response. a cut‐off value of adc was also calculated using receiver operator characteristics analysis to discriminate between normal, benign and malignant breast tissue. similarly, a cut‐off value for adc, volume and diameter was obtained after the second and third cycles of nact to predict tumor response. the results show that adc is more useful for predicting early tumor response to nact than morphological variables, suggesting its potential in effective treatment management. copyright © 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.
0 time-varying discrete-time wavelet transforms time-varying filter banks and wavelets are studied and a design procedure is presented. in the resulting analysis-synthesis structures, the analysis filters and the corresponding synthesis filters, the number of bands, and the decimation rates can be changed with time. such structures can be considered as time-frequency overlapping block transforms. from this viewpoint, the tiling of the time-frequency plane and the corresponding basis functions are changed in time. the time-varying discrete wavelet transforms can be considered a special case of time-varying overlapping block transforms and are studied in detail. the formulation is based on the time domain formulation of time-varying analysis-synthesis structures. the design procedure can be used to design time-varying perfectly invertible transformations with a finite number of distinct analysis structures. for adaptive filter bank application, a least squares design method is also studied. >
cloning and functional characterization of pjporb, a member of the por gene family in pseudosasa japonica cv. akebonosuji during the sequencing of the genome of arabidopsis thaliana a gene has been identified that encodes a novel nadph-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (por)-like protein (accession number ac 002560). this protein has been named por c. we have expressed the por c protein in escherichia coli and have determined its in vitro activity. por c shows the characteristics of a light-dependent and nadph-requiring por similar to por a and por b. the expression of the por c gene differs markedly from that of the por a and por b genes. in contrast to the por a and por b mrnas, the por c mrna has been shown previously to accumulate only after the beginning of illumination. in light-adapted mature plants only por b and por c mrnas were detectable. the amounts of both mrnas show pronounced diurnal rhythmic fluctuations. while the oscillations of por b mrna are under the control of the circadian clock, those of por c mrna are not. another difference between por b and por c was found in seedlings that were grown under continuous white light. the concentration of por c mrna rapidly declined and soon dropped beyond the limit of detection, after these seedlings were transferred to the dark. on the other hand, por b mrna was unaffected by this light/dark shift. when seedlings were exposed to different light intensities, the amounts of por b mrna remained the same, while por a and por c mrnas were modulated in an inverse way by these light intensity changes. por a mrna was still detectable in seedlings grown under low light intensities but disappeared at higher light intensities, while the mrna concentration of por c rose with increasing light intensities. these different responses to light suggest that the functions of the three pors of arabidopsis are not completely redundant, but may allow the plant to adapt its needs for chlorophyll biosynthesis more selectively by using preferentially one of the three enzymes under a given light regime.
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
predictors of response to palliative care intervention for chronic nausea in advanced cancer outpatients the second edition of the oxford textbook of palliative medicine is a very good book, better than the first edition, being far m organized and consistent in its style. there is a wealth of info tion in its 1300 pages demonstrating the diverse nature of the needed in palliative care, however, some of the chapters ne degree of expertise to interpret them in the correct context. th not the book for those who want a ‘manual on palliative care’ book on ‘how to symptom control’. there are many excel small volumes on symptom control in patients with advan cancer. this text book is clearly a reference book. the oxford textbook of palliative medicine illustrates the distinctive skills that are needed by the palliative medicine ph cian. there are a wide range of issues covered in its 22 sec and this is to be expected in what is undoubtedly the major book of palliative care. the largest section is (as one w expect) is on symptom management with approximately 37 c ters. i found some chapters in this section frustrating since were a little pedestrian in their approach. other chapters stimulating but let down by misinformation. a good example this is the chapter on the palliation of respiratory symptoms. is an excellent chapter which reflects the expertise that the a has in this area, however, i suspect many oncologists would cize the comments made about the place and use of chemoth and radiotherapy in patients with lung cancer. in addition i fo that the discussion about the psycho-social management of b lessness was limited, which is surprising considering the sig cant body of literature that supports this approach. the chapters on disease modifying management are exc and more up-to-date than some chapters. these strong chap clinical and medical oncology are welcomed – they will undou edly be very useful to the palliative medicine physician, emp sizing the need for there to be a close collaborative wor relationship between them and the oncologist. one is always selective when reading a large textbook and cannot help but be drawn to chapters in which there is a per
studies on effect of sex and age on physico-chemical and organoleptic qualities of rajasri chicken in this study, the physical-chemical characteristics and proximate composition of the meat of of two strains of broilers (paraiso pedres and master gris plume - super pesadao, utilized for semi-intensive rearing) and cobb® strain, utilized in intensive rearing systems) were evaluated. differences related to strain and sex (males and females) were studied. cobb® broilers were slaughtered at 45 days and the other strains at 85 days. the following characteristics were evaluated in breast and thigh meat: moisture, protein, ether extract, ashes, color (ciel*a*b*), final ph, cooking loss (cl) and shear force (sf). bird strain and sex influenced breast color parameters, with cobb® presenting higher yellowness (b*) and redness (a*) means, whereas females had higher b* values and males, a* values. paraiso pedres had lower sf values. as to proximate composition, there was an interaction between strain and sex, with higher ether extract values in the meat of super pesadao males. cobb® birds presented higher lightness (l*) and b* values, and there was no effect of sex on color parameters. higher ph and sf values were found in the meat of super pesadao birds. there was an interaction between strain and sex for b* and sf values, with higher b* values obtained with cobb® males, while differences between sex, with superiority for females in the paraiso pedres strain and for males in the cobb® strain were found. increased values of sf for males were obtained for super pesadao strain. both paraiso pedres and super pesadao strains presented physicochemical and proximate composition characteristics similar to those of cobb® strain in the cuts breast and thigh so that in a few parameters, no differences between the birds kept in this two rearing systems were found.
effects of altered ephrin-a5 and epha4/epha7 expression on tumor growth in a medulloblastoma mouse model the eph family is thought to exert its function through the complementary expression of receptors and ligands. here, we show that epha receptors colocalize on retinal ganglion cell (rgc) axons with epha ligands, which are expressed in a high-nasal-to-low-temporal pattern. in the stripe assay, only temporal axons are normally sensitive for repellent axon guidance cues of the caudal tectum. however, overexpression of ephrina ligands on temporal axons abolishes this sensitivity, whereas treatment with pi-plc both removes ephrina ligands from retinal axons and induces a striped outgrowth of formerly insensitive nasal axons. in vivo, retinal overexpression of ephrina2 leads to topographic targeting errors of temporal axons. these data suggest that differential ligand expression on retinal axons is a major determinant of topographic targeting in the retinotectal projection.
independent component analysis-based identification of covariance patterns of microstructural white matter damage in alzheimer’s disease dti is one of the most effective mr tools for the investigation of the brain anatomy. in addition to the gray matter, histopathological studies indicate that white matter is also a good target for both the early diagnosis of ad and for monitoring disease progression, which motivates us to use dti to study ad patients in vivo. there are already a large amount of studies reporting significant differences between ad patients and controls, as well as to predict progression of disease in symptomatic non-demented individuals. application of these findings in clinical practice remains to be demonstrated.
somatic embryogenesis from immature zygotic embryos and monitoring the genetic fidelity of regenerated plants in grapevine we report here the successful micropropagation of adult juniperus phoenicea l. with respective ploidy stability studies. microcuttings with axillary buds were grown on five media supplemented with different growth regulator combinations. best elongation rates were achieved on driver and kuniyuki (dkw) medium supplemented with kinetin alone or with naphthaleneacetic acid (naa), while rugini olive (om) medium stimulated the development of new branches. shoots growing on murashige and skoog (ms) medium browned and showed necrotic zones. shoots of second to fourth subcultures usually had higher elongation rates than those of the first culture. for rooting assays, half strength dkw and om media, different concentrations of growth regulators, auxin continuous exposure vs. dipping and the type of solid matrix were assessed. during rooting assays, two morphotypes were observed with one type having well developed internodes and the other showing hyperhydratation and no internode development. high rooting rates (40 %) were only obtained in the first morphotype shoots exposed for 5 min to 2.4 µm iba and then transferred to om medium without growth regulators. plants were acclimatized in pots containing a mixture of peat and perlite (3:2) in greenhouse with progressive reduction of relative humidity. a flow cytometric screening for major ploidy changes revealed no differences among the morphotypes and between them and the mother plant. also the nuclear dna content of this species was estimated for the first time using flow cytometry (2c = 24.71 pg).
axonal projections of renshaw cells in the thoracic spinal cord in anesthetized spontaneously breathing cats (c4-c5 deafferentation), recurrent inhibition of phrenic motoneurons was analyzed by studying either recurrent ipsps in phrenic motoneurons, or renshaw cell discharges evoked by c5 phrenic nerve stimulation. of 90 intracellularly recorded phrenic motoneurons, 7 motoneurons showed evoked recurrent ipsps with stimulation of c5 phrenic axons subthreshold for eliciting antidromic activation of the motoneuron from which intracellular recording was done. these ipsps could be reversed by imposed hyperpolarization of the motoneuron, and were of greater amplitude during inspiration than during expiration. within the phrenic nucleus, interneurons were classified as renshaw cells if they responded to c5 phrenic axon stimulation with a typical high frequency burst of potentials. reactivity of these renshaw cells was related to the respiratory cycle, number of spikes in the burst being greater during inspiration than during expiration. injection of a nicotinic cholinergic blocker (mecamylamine) decreased responses of renshaw cells but the respiratory modulation was still present. some renshaw cells (18/33) were spontaneously active during inspiration. their activity was generally maximal during the last third of inspiration. since: spontaneous activity of renshaw cells is related to the respiratory drive; persists after c7 spinal transection and after mecamylamine poisoning of the axonal recurrent pathway; and might appear before sustained phrenic activity, the assumption of a central respiratory drive impinging on the renshaw cells has to be retained.
same-day discharge after incision and drainage of soft-tissue abscess in diaper-age children is safe and effective background u.s. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.   methods we conducted a randomized trial at five u.s. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. the primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.   results the median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for mrsa. in the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.1 to 11.7; p=0.005). in the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, 3.2 to 11.2; p<0.001). trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% ci, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. at 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.   conclusions in settings in which mrsa was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo.

emotional valence detection based on a novel wavelet feature extraction strategy using eeg signals in this paper, we summarize the human emotion recognition using different set of electroencephalogram (eeg) channels using discrete wavelet transform. an audio-visual induction based protocol has been designed with more dynamic emotional content for inducing discrete emotions (disgust, happy, surprise, fear and neutral). eeg signals are collected using 64 electrodes from 20 subjects and are placed over the entire scalp using international 10-10 system. the raw eeg signals are preprocessed using surface laplacian (sl) filtering method and decomposed into three different frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) using discrete wavelet transform (dwt). we have used “db4” wavelet function for deriving a set of conventional and modified energy based features from the eeg signals for classifying emotions. two simple pattern classification methods, k nearest neighbor (knn) and linear discriminant analysis (lda) methods are used and their performances are compared for emotional states classification. the experimental results indicate that, one of the proposed features (alree) gives the maximum average classification rate of 83.26% using knn and 75.21% using lda compared to those of conventional features. finally, we present the average classification rate and subsets of emotions classification rate of these two different classifiers for justifying the performance of our emotion recognition system.
the ire1alpha-xbp1 pathway of the unfolded protein response is required for adipogenesis. the protein kinase perk couples protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) to polypeptide biosynthesis by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eif2alpha), attenuating translation initiation in response to er stress. perk is highly expressed in mouse pancreas, an organ active in protein secretion. under physiological conditions, perk was partially activated, accounting for much of the phosphorylated eif2alpha in the pancreas. the exocrine and endocrine pancreas developed normally in perk-/- mice. postnatally, er distention and activation of the er stress transducer ire1alpha accompanied increased cell death and led to progressive diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. these findings suggest a special role for translational control in protecting secretory cells from er stress.
multisensory distortions of the hand have differential effects on tactile perception sir, there is increasing evidence that drug-free illusion therapies can be beneficial for the amelioration of chronic pain, particularly so for conditions in which some of the pain is thought to have a cortical origin. for example, mirror therapy and size reduction illusions can reduce pain in complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (crps1) patients, the majority of whom have disturbed body representations with some reporting their hand as larger than in reality [1] and others describing parts of their hand as foreshortened [2]. if cortical misrepresentation of body parts contributes to pain, then manipulating the appearance of those body parts might be a useful tool in the reduction of pain. this letter describes an exploratory experiment using unique visuo-proprioceptive illusions that manipulated the perceived size of painful and non-painful parts of the hand in an attempt to modulate pain experienced in oa.    illusions were applied using a mirage system [3] that presents real-time video capture of the actual hand from the same position and perspective as if viewing the real hand directly (fig. 1a). visual manipulations can be applied to the image such that they appear to happen to the real hand. the experimental manipulations were stretching (fig. 1b) and shrinking (fig. 1c): gently pulling or pushing on part of the hand while simultaneously elongating or shortening the image gives a strong illusion that the hand is being stretched or shortened (see supplementary material for video). control illusions included stretching and shrinking a non-painful part of the hand and visually enlarging/reducing the entire hand.        fig. 1    (a) a healthy participant having her finger stretched using mirage; examples of arthritic hands after being stretched (b) and shrunk (c) and (d) the percentage pain reduction after manipulation for painful and non-painful body parts. a direct comparison ...        a total of 20 oa sufferers [2 males; mean (s.d.) age: 70.5 (6.5) years] with clinically diagnosed arthritic pain in the hands and/or fingers for >12 months were tested. participants gave written consent in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. the study met with ethical approval from the university of nottingham school of psychology ethics committee (code: 20072010). none of the participants were pain free on the day of testing and none had used pain medication other than paracetamol. participants verbally reported their pain levels on a 21-point numerical rating scale (nrs) with 0 indicating no pain at all and 20 indicating the most unbearable pain imaginable. the scores were adjusted relative to a baseline condition of gently pulling or pushing the hand without visual manipulation. nrs ratings of pain for the painful part of the hand were taken before and after stretching or shrinking the painful and non-painful parts of the hand as well as before and after enlarging or reducing the entire hand.    overall, illusory manipulation was extremely beneficial, on average halving the reported pain in 85% of participants. some reported greater reduction in pain for stretching, some for shrinking and some for both. crucially, pain reduction was only observed when the painful part of the hand was manipulated and not when manipulating the non-painful part (fig. 1d) or when enlarging or reducing the whole hand (although the latter was only tested in a minority of participants). for those in whom stretching was beneficial, the mean reduction in pain was ∼50% (pre = 6.42 on the nrs; post = 3.33), while beneficial shrinking produced a ∼45% reduction (pre = 5.83; post = 3.15). remarkably, illusory stretching or shrinking of the painful body part temporarily eliminated all pain in one-third of all participants and in 41% of those for whom the illusion was effective. although not formally assessed, many participants spontaneously reported an increased range of movement following manipulation and most reported pain reduction before active movement was permitted. many participants gave spontaneous verbal reports such as: ‘i can feel my whole body relaxing.’; ‘my pain has completely gone.’; and ‘i wasn’t able to move like that before.’    this experiment demonstrates a strong analgesic effect of multisensory illusions for oa, which (though not tested directly) is consistent with the idea that some of the pain experienced in arthritic conditions may result from dysfunctional representations of the body [4]. furthermore, the methods described may provide a mechanism for promoting therapeutic exercise normally prevented by painful movement. the effects of mini-magnification appear to be specific to the part of the body in which the pain is experienced and do not require active movement of the hand. intriguingly, both shrinking and stretching were found to be beneficial in different, and sometimes the same, participants. this may be due to two distinct processes: the matching of cortical representations and the reduction of apparent swelling, which may vary between participants according to different physical and cortical representations. although the current experiment describes striking analgesic effects, it does not completely rule out placebo effects and more comprehensive experimental research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms and validate the beneficial effects. in particular, the effects of having attention drawn to the painful part of the hand while being manipulated must be adequately controlled for. however, these initial results suggest that multisensory illusions are a useful avenue of research for the treatment of pain in oa.        disclosure statement: the authors have declared no conflicts of interest.
effects of 24-epibrassinolide on seed germination, seedling growth, lipid peroxidation, proline content and antioxidative system of rice (oryza sativa l.) under salinity stress we examined the effects of brassinosteroids on arabidopsis thaliana (l.) henyh. ecotype columbia in order to develop a model system for studying gene regulation by plant steroids. submicromolar concentrations of two brassinosteroids, brassinolide and 24-epibrassinolide, stimulated elongation of arabidopsis peduncles and inhibited root elongation, respectively. furthermore, brassinolide altered the abundance of specific in vitro translatable mrnas from peduncles and whole plants of arabidopsis. root elongation in the auxin-insensitive arabidopsis mutant axr1 was inhibited by 24-epibrassinolide but not by 2,4-d, indicating an independent mode of action for these growth regulators in this physiological response.
relationship between body mass index and adiposity in prepubertal children: ethnic and geographic comparisons between new york city and jinan city (china). objectives to test the hypothesis that in a healthy pediatric population body mass index (bmi) (kilograms per meter square) is a valid measure of fatness that is independent of age for both sexes.   methods total body fat (tbf) (in kilograms) and percent of body weight as fat (pbf) were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) in 198 healthy italian children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age. we developed multiple regression analysis models with tbf and percent body fat as dependent variables and bmi, age, and interaction terms as independent variables. separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls.   results bmi was strongly associated with tbf (r2 = 0.85 and 0.89 for boys and girls, respectively) and pbf (r2 =0.63 and 0.69 for boys and girls, respectively). confidence limits on bmi-fatness association were wide, with individuals of similar bmi showing large differences in tbf and in pbf. age was a significant covariate in all regression models. addition of nonlinear terms for bmi did not substantially increase the r2 for tbf and pbf models in boys and girls.   conclusion our results support the use of bmi as a fatness measure in groups of children and adolescents, although interpretation should be cautious when comparing bmi across groups that differ in age or when predicting a specific individual's tbf or pbf.
molecular typing of staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis based on polymorphism of the coagulase gene in the north west of iran. abstract in the present study, 103 staphylococcus aureusstrains isolated from milk samples from 60 cows with mastitis from eight different farms in seven different locations in one region of germany were compared pheno- and genotypically and by identification of various toxins. on the basis of culture and hemolytic properties and by determination of the tube coagulase reaction, all of the isolates could be identified as s. aureus. this could be confirmed by pcr amplification of species-specific parts of the gene encoding the 23s rrna. in addition, all of the s. aureus isolates harbored the genes encoding staphylococcal coagulase and clumping factor and the genes encoding the x region and the immunoglobulin g binding region of protein a. these four genes displayed size polymorphisms. by pcr amplification, the genes for the toxins staphylococcal enterotoxin a (sea), sec, sed, seg, sei, sej, and tsst-1 but not those for seb, see, seh, and the exfoliative toxins eta and etb could be detected. to analyze the epidemiological relationships, the isolates were subjected to dna fingerprinting by macrorestriction analysis of their chromosomal dnas. according to the observed gene polymorphisms, the toxin patterns, and the information given by macrorestriction analysis of the isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a limited number of clones seemed to be responsible for the cases of bovine mastitis on the various farms.
selective population rate coding: a possible computational role of gamma oscillations in selective attention we describe a simple computational model, based on generic features of cortical local circuits, that links cholinergic neuromodulation, gamma rhythmicity, and attentional selection. we propose that cholinergic modulation, by reducing adaptation currents in principal cells, induces a transition from asynchronous spontaneous activity to a "background" gamma rhythm (resembling the persistent gamma rhythms evoked in vitro by cholinergic agonists) in which individual principal cells participate infrequently and irregularly. we suggest that such rhythms accompany states of preparatory attention or vigilance and report simulations demonstrating that their presence can amplify stimulus-specific responses and enhance stimulus competition within a local circuit.
angiotensin ii stimulates epithelial sodium channels in the cortical collecting duct of the rat kidney. angiotensin ii (angii) is an important mediator in renal injury. accumulating evidence suggests that angii stimulates intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ros) such as the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. angii activates several subunits of the membrane-bound multicomponent nad(p)h oxidase and also increases ros formation in the mitochondria. some of these effects may be induced by aldosterone and not directly by angii. the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide influence other downstream signaling pathways, such as transcription factors, tyrosine kinases/phosphatases, ion channels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. through these signaling pathways, ros have distinct functional effects on renal cells. they are transducers of cell growth, apoptosis, and cell migration and affect expression of inflammatory and extracellular matrix genes. for example, angii-mediated expression of p27(kip1), a cell-cycle regulatory protein, and induction of tubular hypertrophy depend on the generation of ros. the effects of ros generated within different renal cells ultimately depend on the locally generated concentrations and the balance of pro- and antioxidant pathways. although the concept that angii mediates oxidative stress in the kidney has been validated in experimental models, the exact role is still incompletely understood in human renal diseases.
molecular basis of ‘hypoxic’ breast cancer cell radio-sensitization: phytochemicals converge on radiation induced rel signaling purpose we recently reported that curcumin attenuates ionizing radiation (ir)-induced survival signaling and proliferation in human neuroblastoma cells. also, in the endothelial system, we have demonstrated that nfκb regulates ir-induced telomerase activity (ta). accordingly, we investigated the effect of curcumin in inhibiting ir-induced nfκb-dependent htert transcription, ta, and cell survival in neuroblastoma cells.   methods and materials sk-n-mc or sh-sy5y cells exposed to ir and treated with curcumin (10-100 nm) with or without ir were harvested after 1 h through 24 h. nfκb-dependent regulation was investigated either by luciferase reporter assays using pnfκb-, pgl3-354-, pgl3-347-, or puse-iκbα-luc, p50/p65, or rela sirna-transfected cells. nfκb activity was analyzed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and htert expression using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. ta was determined using the telomerase repeat amplification protocol assay and cell survival using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltertrazolium bromide and clonogenic assay.   results curcumin profoundly inhibited ir-induced nfκb. consequently, curcumin significantly inhibited ir-induced ta and htert mrna at all points investigated. furthermore, ir-induced ta is regulated at the transcriptional level by triggering telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter activation. moreover, nfκb becomes functionally activated after ir and mediates ta upregulation by binding to the κb-binding region in the promoter region of the tert gene. consistently, elimination of the nfκb-recognition site on the telomerase promoter or inhibition of nfκb by the iκbα mutant compromises ir-induced telomerase promoter activation. significantly, curcumin inhibited ir-induced tert transcription. consequently, curcumin inhibited htert mrna and ta in nfκb overexpressed cells. furthermore, curcumin enhanced the ir-induced inhibition of cell survival.   conclusions these results strongly suggest that curcumin inhibits ir-induced ta in an nfκb dependent manner in human neuroblastoma cells.
a systematic evaluation of a multidisciplinary social work–lawyer elder mistreatment intervention model this study compared 2 approaches to the assessment of adult protective services (aps) cases. using administrative data from 869 cases in 2 counties in maryland, the differences between a nurse/social worker team and a lone social worker in case disposition, risk reduction, recidivism, and cost effectiveness were examined. lone social workers were significantly more likely to confirm financial exploitation, physical abuse, and neglect by others; while the team approach resulted in significantly greater risk reduction. no differences were observed in relation to recidivism, self-neglect and cost savings. given limited resources, research that examines optimal staffing patterns in aps agencies is warranted.
egocentric and allocentric reference frames for catching a falling object prevailing views on how we time the interception of a moving object assume that the visual inputs are informationally sufficient to estimate the time-to-contact from the object's kinematics. here we present evidence in favor of a different view: the brain makes the best estimate about target motion based on measured kinematics and an a priori guess about the causes of motion. according to this theory, a predictive model is used to extrapolate time-to-contact from expected dynamics (kinetics). we projected a virtual target moving vertically downward on a wide screen with different randomized laws of motion. in the first series of experiments, subjects were asked to intercept this target by punching a real ball that fell hidden behind the screen and arrived in synchrony with the visual target. subjects systematically timed their motor responses consistent with the assumption of gravity effects on an object's mass, even when the visual target did not accelerate. with training, the gravity model was not switched off but adapted to nonaccelerating targets by shifting the time of motor activation. in the second series of experiments, there was no real ball falling behind the screen. instead the subjects were required to intercept the visual target by clicking a mousebutton. in this case, subjects timed their responses consistent with the assumption of uniform motion in the absence of forces, even when the target actually accelerated. overall, the results are in accord with the theory that motor responses evoked by visual kinematics are modulated by a prior of the target dynamics. the prior appears surprisingly resistant to modifications based on performance errors.

abdominal vs buttock adipose fat: relationships with children's serum lipid levels we compared the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue from three different sites, one deep-seated site (perirenal) and two subcutaneous sites (abdominal and buttock), in 143 autopsied adult humans aged 24-61 y. the proportion of saturated fatty acids was highest in the perirenal adipose tissue and lowest in buttock adipose tissue. the proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids in the three sites were in the reverse order. linoleic and linolenic acids were similar in the three adipose-tissue sites, an important finding for those concerned about the essential fatty acids, which are solely derived from the diet. the results clearly show that the fatty acid composition of the two subcutaneous fat depots differ significantly. we conclude that abdominal fat is more saturated than buttock fat.
protein kinase c modulates frequency of micturition and non-voiding contractions in the urinary bladder via neuronal and myogenic mechanisms purpose we evaluate the role of protein kinase c in excitatory purinergic neurotransmission in the mouse bladder.   materials and methods in isolated mouse detrusor strips contractile responses to electrical field stimulation were mostly mediated by neural released acetylcholine and adenosine triphosphate (atp). the changes in neurotransmission were measured indirectly by recording the contraction of detrusor strips in response to repetitive electrical field stimulation by trains of electrical pulses at 8 hz. 1 second in duration.   results a protein kinase c activator, 1 to 2.5 nm. (beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (beta-pdbu), but not the inactive form alpha-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, significantly enhanced neurogenic detrusor contractions. the purinergic component of the evoked detrusor contractions in the presence of atropine was specifically sensitive to this enhancing effect by beta-pdbu but the cholinergic component in the alpha,beta-methylene atp treated detrusors remained unaffected. this enhancing effect of beta-pdbu was dependent on the extracellular calcium (ca2+) concentration. a p and/or q type ca2+ channel blocker, 0.1 and 0.3 microm. omega-conotoxin-mviic, and protein kinase c inhibitors, 0.3 and 1 microm. staurosporine and 0.3 and 1 microm. bisindolylmaleimide i but not 0.1 and 0.3 microm. omega-conotoxin-gvia, an n type ca2+ channel blocker, abolished the effect of beta-pdbu. moreover, beta-pdbu did not affect the muscle responses induced by the exogenous agonists carbachol or alpha,beta-methylene atp and potassium chloride.   conclusions these results suggest that the activation of ca2+ channel, especially the p and/or q type, may be involved in the enhancing effect of protein kinase c activator beta-pdbu on muscle contractions elicited by excitatory purinergic neurotransmission in the mouse detrusor strips.
increasing physical activity in multiple sclerosis: replicating internet intervention effects using objective and self-report outcomes. background:physical activity has been associated with improvements in walking mobility and quality of life in persons with multiple sclerosis (ms), and yet this population is largely sedentary and inactive compared with the general population. objectives:we conducted a pilot, randomized controlled trial (rct) for examining the effect of an internet intervention based on social cognitive theory (sct) for favorably increasing physical activity among persons with ms. we further examined variables from sct as possible mediators of the internet intervention. methods:we randomly allocated 54 persons with ms into either an internet intervention condition or a waitlist control condition. the participants completed measures of physical activity, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, functional limitations, and goal setting before and after the 12-week period. results:the intervention group reported a statistically significant (p = 0.01) and large increase in physical activity over time (d = 0.72), whereas the control group had a small (d = 0.04) and non-significant change in physical activity (p = 0.71). the intervention group further reported a statistically significant (p = 0.001) and large increase in goal setting over time (d = 0.97), whereas the control group had a small (d = −0.13) and non-significant change (p = 0.17). the change in goal setting over time mediated the effect of the internet intervention on physical activity behavior. conclusions:this pilot study sets the stage for a subsequent rct that includes a larger sample of persons with ms, longer intervention period along with a follow-up, objective measure of physical activity, and secondary outcomes of walking mobility and qol.
the inflammatory response and neuronal injury in streptococcus suis meningitis backgroundbacteremia and systemic complications both play important roles in brain pathophysiological alterations and the outcome of pneumococcal meningitis. their individual contributions to the development of brain damage, however, still remain to be defined.methodsusing an adult rat pneumococcal meningitis model, the impact of bacteremia accompanying meningitis on the development of hippocampal injury was studied. the study comprised of the three groups: i. meningitis (n = 11), ii. meningitis with attenuated bacteremia resulting from iv injection of serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies (n = 14), and iii. uninfected controls (n = 6).resultspneumococcal meningitis resulted in a significantly higher apoptosis score 0.22 (0.18-0.35) compared to uninfected controls (0.02 (0.00-0.02), mann whitney test, p = 0.0003). also, meningitis with an attenuation of bacteremia by antibody treatment resulted in significantly reduced apoptosis (0.08 (0.02-0.20), p = 0.01) as compared to meningitis.conclusionsour results demonstrate that bacteremia accompanying meningitis plays an important role in the development of hippocampal injury in pneumococcal meningitis.
efficacy of glycosaminoglycans in papain induced osteoarthritis rat model in relation to histological lesions scoring. objective to examine the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate (cs) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (oa) on the basis of a metaanalysis of controlled clinical trials.   methods after personal, medline, and embase searches, a decision tree analysis of the available publications was performed, with respect to types of joint involvement studied, study designs, numbers of patients enrolled, and variables analyzed. the lequesne index and pain rating on visual analog scale (vas) were considered the main variables. of a total of 16 publications found, 7 trials of 372 patients taking cs could be enrolled into the metaanalysis. although all selected studies claimed to be randomized, double blind designs in parallel groups, it should be noted that cs was given along with analgesics or nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs, making required dosage of comedication an important factor.   results following patients to 120 or more days, cs was shown to be significantly superior to placebo with respect to the lequesne index and pain vas. pooled data confirmed these results and showed at least 50% improvement in the study variables in the cs group compared to placebo.   conclusion cs may be useful in oa, but further investigations in larger cohorts of patients for longer time periods are needed to prove its usefulness as a symptom modifying drug in oa.
regional population structure of a widely introduced estuarine invertebrate: nematostella vectensis stephenson in new england molecular markers derived from polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of genomic dna are an important part of the toolkit of evolutionary geneticists. random amplified polymorphic dna markers (rapds), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (aflps) and intersimple sequence repeat (issr) polymorphisms allow analysis of species for which previous dna sequence information is lacking, but dominance makes it impossible to apply standard techniques to calculate f‐statistics. we describe a bayesian method that allows direct estimates of fst from dominant markers. in contrast to existing alternatives, we do not assume previous knowledge of the degree of within‐population inbreeding. in particular, we do not assume that genotypes within populations are in hardy–weinberg proportions. our estimate of fst incorporates uncertainty about the magnitude of within‐population inbreeding. simulations show that samples from even a relatively small number of loci and populations produce reliable estimates of fst. moreover, some information about the degree of within‐population inbreeding (fis) is available from data sets with a large number of loci and populations. we illustrate the method with a reanalysis of rapd data from 14 populations of a north american orchid, platanthera leucophaea.
reproducibility in echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function in a population based study (the stanislas cohort study) quantification of cardiac chamber size, ventricular mass and function ranks among the most clinically important and most frequently requested tasks of echocardiography. over the last decades, echocardiographic methods and techniques have improved and expanded dramatically, due to the introduction of higher frequency transducers, harmonic imaging, fully digital machines, left-sided contrast agents, and other technological advancements. furthermore, echocardiography due to its portability and versatility is now used in emergency rooms, operating rooms, and intensive care units. standardization of measurements in echocardiography has been inconsistent and less successful, compared to other imaging techniques and consequently, echocardiographic measurements are sometimes perceived as less reliable. therefore, the american society of echocardiography, working together with the european association of echocardiography, a branch of the european society of cardiology, has critically reviewed the literature and updated the recommendations for quantifying cardiac chambers using echocardiography. this document reviews the technical aspects on how to perform quantitative chamber measurements of morphology and function, which is a component of every complete echocardiographic examination.
the effect of compressed speech on the ability of right-hemisphere-damaged patients to use context the ability of right-brain-damaged (rbd) patients to use on-line contextual information in a word-monitoring task was examined. subjects were required to monitor for target words in the contexts of both normal and semantically anomalous sentences. similar to previous studies with normals (e.g., marslen-wilson & tyler, 1980), the semantic integrity of the context was influential in the word-recognition process. importantly, the rbd patients performed similarly to normals in showing context effects. these results were interpreted as substantiating the findings of leonard, waters, and caplan (1997a, 1997b) that rbd patients do not present with a specific deficit in the use of contextual information. the results are discussed in terms of proposals that suggest that an impaired ability to use contextual information by rbd patients may be a function of increased processing demands.
working overtime: patterns of smartphone and pc usage in the day of an information worker the number of computing devices that people use is growing. to gain a better understanding of why and how people use multiple devices, we interviewed 27 people from academia and industry. from these interviews we distill four primary findings. first, associating a user's activities with a particular device is problematic for multiple device users because many activities span multiple devices. second, device use varies by user and circumstance; users assign different roles to devices both by choice and by constraint. third, users in industry want to separate work and personal activities across work and personal devices, but they have difficulty doing so in practice finally, users employ a variety of techniques for accessing information across devices, but there is room for improvement: participants reported managing information across their devices as the most challenging aspect of using multiple devices. we suggest opportunities to improve the user experience by focusing on the user rather than the applications and devices; making devices aware of their roles; and providing lighter-weight methods for transferring information, including synchronization services that engender more trust from users.
a memory-based foraging tactic reveals an adaptive mechanism for restricted space use. thanks to recent technological advances, it is now possible to track with an unprecedented precision and for long periods of time the movement patterns of many living organisms in their habitat. the increasing amount of data available on single trajectories offers the possibility of understanding how animals move and of testing basic movement models. random walks have long represented the main description for micro-organisms and have also been useful to understand the foraging behaviour of large animals. nevertheless, most vertebrates, in particular humans and other primates, rely on sophisticated cognitive tools such as spatial maps, episodic memory and travel cost discounting. these properties call for other modelling approaches of mobility patterns. we propose a foraging framework where a learning mobile agent uses a combination of memory-based and random steps. we investigate how advantageous it is to use memory for exploiting resources in heterogeneous and changing environments. an adequate balance of determinism and random exploration is found to maximize the foraging efficiency and to generate trajectories with an intricate spatio-temporal order, where travel routes emerge without multi-step planning. based on this approach, we propose some tools for analysing the non-random nature of mobility patterns in general.
a mortality study of beryllium workers there is controversy on whether occupational exposure to beryllium causes lung cancer. we conducted a systematic review of epidemiologic studies on cancer among workers exposed to beryllium, including a study of seven u.s. production plants which has been recently updated, a study of patients with beryllium disease (largely overlapping with the former study) and several smaller studies. a small excess mortality from lung cancer was detected in the large cohort, which was partially explained by confounding by tobacco smoking and urban residence. other potential confounders have not been addressed. the excess mortality was mainly among workers employed (often for a short duration) in the early phase of the manufacturing industry. there was no relation with duration of employment or cumulative exposure, whereas average and maximum exposure were associated with lung cancer risk. the use of lagged exposure variables resulted in associations with lung cancer risk; however, these associations were due to confounding by year of birth and year of hire. the studies of beryllium disease patients do not provide independent evidence and the results from other studies do not support the hypothesis of an increased risk of lung cancer or any other cancer. overall, the available evidence does not support a conclusion that a causal association has been established between occupational exposure to beryllium and the risk of cancer.
frequency and predictors of renal artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease. in recent years, the importance of renovascular disease as a cause of end-stage renal disease has been emphasized. among 1,788 cases autopsied during the 12-year period between 1981 and 1992 at the national cardiovascular center hospital, we examined cases over 40 years of age with autopsy evidence of myocardial infarction to determine the prevalence and predictors of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in the atherosclerotic population. two hundred ninety-seven patients remained for analysis. in this population, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis was found in 35 patients (12%), and 10 of them had bilateral renal artery stenosis. in patients with hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis was found in 19%, 39%, and 39%, respectively. as the number of coronary vessels with significant stenosis increased, the prevalence of renal artery stenosis increased. the severity of stenotic lesions of coronary artery was also correlated with the presence of renal artery stenosis. multiple logistic regression analysis identified age, hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency as independent predictors of renal artery stenosis. patients with hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency had 3.4-, 13.5-, and 4.8-fold increased risk of renal artery stenosis in the population with myocardial infarction. the number of coronary arteries with severe stenosis was also an independent predictor of renal artery stenosis, and had a relative risk of 2.1. these results indicated that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is common in patients with myocardial infarction, particularly when hypertension, proteinuria, or renal insufficiency is present. the presence of severe multivessel coronary artery disease suggests a higher incidence of renal artery stenosis.
implication of tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 and hexosaminidase: relationship to pathogenesis of liver diseases liver cirrhosis is a risk factor for osteoporosis. nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms of bone mass loss in patients with viral cirrhosis. tnfalpha is a potent bone-resorbing agent. serum concentrations of soluble tnf receptor p55 (stnfr-55) correlate with clinical activity in liver cirrhosis. our aim was to evaluate the possible role of stnfr-55 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in patients with viral cirrhosis and its relationship with bone turnover markers. we studied 40 consecutive patients with viral cirrhosis and no history of alcohol intake and 26 healthy volunteers. bone mineral density (bmd) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine (ls) and femoral neck (fn). patients with viral cirrhosis had reduced bmd (expressed as the z-score) in all sites [ls, -1.5 +/- 0.22 (p < 0.001); fn, -0.37 +/- 0.15 (p < 0.01)]. serum concentrations of stnfr-55 and urinary deoxypyridinoline, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, were significantly higher in patients with osteoporosis than in patients without osteoporosis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). serum levels of stnfr-55 correlated inversely with bmd in ls (r = -0.62; p < 0.005) and fn (r = -0.47; p < 0.05) and positively with urinary deoxypyridinoline (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). our findings show that high serum concentrations of stnfr-55 play a role in the pathogenesis of viral cirrhosis-associated bone mass loss and provide evidence of increased bone resorption related to the high serum stnfr-55 levels.
detection of stimulus displacements across saccades is capacity-limited and biased in favor of the saccade target recent evidence has suggested that relatively precise information about the location and visual form of a saccade target object is retained across a saccade. however, this information appears to be available for report only when the target is removed briefly, so that the display is blank when the eyes land. we hypothesized that the availability of precise target information is dependent on whether a post-saccade object is mapped to the same object representation established for the presaccade target. if so, then the post-saccade features of the target overwrite the presaccade features, a process of object mediated updating in which visual masking is governed by object continuity. in two experiments, participants' sensitivity to the spatial displacement of a saccade target was improved when that object changed surface feature properties across the saccade, consistent with the prediction of the object-mediating updating account. transsaccadic perception appears to depend on a mechanism of object-based masking that is observed across multiple domains of vision. in addition, the results demonstrate that surface-feature continuity contributes to visual stability across saccades.
impact of noncommunicable disease multimorbidity on healthcare utilisation and out-of-pocket expenditures in middle-income countries: cross sectional analysis background long-term disorders are the main challenge facing health-care systems worldwide, but health systems are largely configured for individual diseases rather than multimorbidity. we examined the distribution of multimorbidity, and of comorbidity of physical and mental health disorders, in relation to age and socioeconomic deprivation.   methods in a cross-sectional study we extracted data on 40 morbidities from a database of 1,751,841 people registered with 314 medical practices in scotland as of march, 2007. we analysed the data according to the number of morbidities, disorder type (physical or mental), sex, age, and socioeconomic status. we defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more disorders.   findings 42·2% (95% ci 42·1-42·3) of all patients had one or more morbidities, and 23·2% (23·08-23·21) were multimorbid. although the prevalence of multimorbidity increased substantially with age and was present in most people aged 65 years and older, the absolute number of people with multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years (210,500 vs 194,996). onset of multimorbidity occurred 10-15 years earlier in people living in the most deprived areas compared with the most affluent, with socioeconomic deprivation particularly associated with multimorbidity that included mental health disorders (prevalence of both physical and mental health disorder 11·0%, 95% ci 10·9-11·2% in most deprived area vs 5·9%, 5·8%-6·0% in least deprived). the presence of a mental health disorder increased as the number of physical morbidities increased (adjusted odds ratio 6·74, 95% ci 6·59-6·90 for five or more disorders vs 1·95, 1·93-1·98 for one disorder), and was much greater in more deprived than in less deprived people (2·28, 2·21-2·32 vs 1·08, 1·05-1·11).   interpretation our findings challenge the single-disease framework by which most health care, medical research, and medical education is configured. a complementary strategy is needed, supporting generalist clinicians to provide personalised, comprehensive continuity of care, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas.   funding scottish government chief scientist office.
reading faces for information about words and emotions in adolescents with autism. this study examined differences in the ability to decode emotion through facial expression, prosody, and verbal content between 14 children with asperger’s syndrome (as) and 16 typically developing peers. the ability to decode emotion was measured by the perception of emotion test (poet), which portrayed the emotions of happy, angry, sad, and neutral among the modalities of static and dynamic facial expression, prosody, verbal content, and all modalities combined. results revealed that children with as had more difficulty identifying emotions through static facial expression, dynamic facial expression, and prosody than typically developing children. results are discussed in relationship to an over-reliance on verbal content as a compensatory strategy in social interactions. treatment implications for individuals with as are also discussed.
association between dietary intake of folate and mthfr and mtr genotype with risk of breast cancer. objective to evaluate the relationship between dietary folate intake and genetic polymorphisms of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) with reference to breast cancer risk.   methods a case-control study was conducted with 669 cases and 682 population-based controls in jiangsu province of china. mthfr c677t and a1298c genotypes were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) methods. dietary folate intake was assessed by using an 83-item food frequency questionnaire. odds ratios (or) were estimated with an unconditional logistic model.   results the frequencies of mthfr c677t c/c, c/t and t/t genotypes were 32.37% (202/624), 48.88% (305/624) and 18.75% (117/624) in cases and 37.66% (235/624), 48.24% (301/624) and 14. 10% (88/624) in controls, respectively. the difference in distribution was significant (chi2 = 6.616, p = 0.037), the t/t genotype being associated with an elevated or for breast cancer (1.62, 95% ci: 1.14 -2.30). the frequencies of mthfr a1298c a/a, a/c and c/c were 71.47% (446/624), 27.08% (169/624) and 1.44% (9/624) in cases and 68.11%(425/624), 30.13% (188/624) and 1.76% (11/624)in controls,with no significant differences found (chi2 = 1.716, p= 0.424). folate intake of cases [(263.00 +/- 137.38) microg/d] was significantly lower than that of controls [(285.12 +/- 149.61) microg/d] (t = -2. 830, p =0.005). compared with the lowest tertile (< or = 199.08 microg/d) of folate intake, the adjusted or for breast cancer in the top tertile (> or = 315.11 microg/d) was 0.70 (95% ci: 0.53 -0.92). among individuals with the mthfr a1298c a/a genotype,adjusted or for breast cancer were 0.89 (95% ci: 0.62 - 1.27) and 1.69 (95% ci: 1.20 - 2.36) for the second to the third tertile of folate intake compared with the highest folate intake group (x2trend = 11.372, p = 0.001).   conclusion the findings of the present study suggest that mthfr genetic polymorphisms,and dietary intake of folate may modify susceptibility to breast cancer.
investigation and identification of protein γ-glutamyl carboxylation sites summary rvp-net is an online program for the prediction of real valued solvent accessibility. all previous methods of accessible surface area (asa) predictions classify amino acid residues into exposure states and named them buried or exposed based on different thresholds. real values in some cases were generated by taking the mid points of these state thresholds. this is the first method, which provides a direct prediction of asa without making exposure categories and achieves results better than 19% mean absolute error. to facilitate batch processing of several sequences, a standalone version of this tool is also provided.   availability online predictions are available at http://www.netasa.org/rvp-net/. standalone version of the program can be obtained from the corresponding author by e-mail request.
mouse stomach transcriptional profiling of gastrin-regulated genes in background & aims gastrin deficiency and proton pump inhibitor treatment cause achlorhydria, which predisposes to disease. to elucidate the underlying molecular biology, we examined the changes in gastric gene expression in both types of achlorhydria. we also explored the associated changes in the gastric microflora and the long-term consequences of gastrin-deficient achlorhydria.   methods expression profiles were generated from gastric rna from wild-type mice, gastrin knockout (ko) mice, gastrin ko mice after 1 week of gastrin infusion, and wild-type mice treated for 1 month with a proton pump inhibitor. the results were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. selective media were used to characterize the gastric microflora.   results the number of gastric bacteria was increased in both gastrin ko and ppi-treated mice. the expression profiles revealed activation of immune defense genes, interferon-regulated response genes, and intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa. in young gastrin-deficient mice, gastrin infusions reversed the changes. over time, the changes accumulated, became irreversible, and progressed into metaplasia and polyp development. finally, the study showed that gastrin regulated the expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins.   conclusions independently of gastrin, achlorhydria is associated with gastric bacterial overgrowth and intestinal gene expression patterns and is associated with predisposition to disease. gastrin is therefore essential for prevention of gastric disease, mainly through control of acid secretion but to a lesser extent also through control of gastric gene expression. the gastrin-deficient mouse serves as a useful new model for gastric metaplasia and neoplasia.
estradiol replacement reverses ovariectomy-induced muscle contractile and myosin dysfunction in mature female mice. the study's objective was to determine whether estradiol (e2) deficiency alters the functional relationship of muscle to bone and causes a differential increase in injury susceptibility. ovariectomized 6-wk-old mice were administered e2 (40 micrograms. day-1. kg-1; n = 8) or the oil vehicle (n = 8) for 21 days. the anterior crural muscles of the left hindlimb were then stimulated to produce 150 maximal in vivo eccentric contractions. in vitro functional measurements were then made on the extensor digitorum longus (edl) muscle and tibia from both the exercised and unexercised legs. the maximal isometric torque produced by the anterior crural muscles before the eccentric contraction protocol and the unexercised edl maximal isometric tetanic force (p(0)) were higher in e2-treated mice by 18 and 14%, respectively (p < or = 0.03). both ultimate load and stiffness for the unexercised tibia were higher by 16% in e2-treated mice (p < or = 0.03). the muscle-to-bone relationship of these measurements was unaffected by e2 status (p > or = 0.59). no evidence for increased injury susceptibility was found in either tissue from e2-deficient mice. in fact, the decrement in p(0) was only 36.9 +/- 3.8% in exercised edl muscles from e2-deficient mice compared with 50.6 +/- 4.2% in exercised muscles from e2-treated mice (p = 0.03). tibia stiffness was 3.9% higher in bones from exercised legs than in bones from unexercised legs (72.64 +/- 2.77 vs. 69.95 +/- 2.66 n/mm; p = 0.05) with ultimate load showing a similar trend (p = 0.07); no effect of e2 status was observed on these differences (p > or = 0.53). in conclusion, the functional relationship of bone to muscle and the susceptibility to injury in bone are not altered by the presence of e2 in ovariectomized mice; however, e2 does increase injury susceptibility in the edl muscle.
pharmacological and functional properties of trpm8 channels in prostate tumor cells the ca2+-permeable channel trpm8 is thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer. we have investigated the intracellular location of trpm8 and its role as a ca2+-permeable channel in an androgen-responsive and an androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell line. we report evidence from immunofluorescence experiments that in the androgen-responsive lncap cell line, the trpm8 protein is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, acts as a ca2+-permeable channel (assessed using fura-2 to measure increases in the cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration) in each of these membranes, and is regulated by androgen. although trpm8 was detected in the androgen-insensitive pc-3 cell line, no evidence was obtained for regulation of its expression by androgen. the results of experiments using lncap cells, the trpm8 antagonist capsazepine, and small interference rna targeted to trpm8 indicate that trpm8 is required for cell survival. these results indicate that trpm8 is an important determinator of ca2+ homeostasis in prostate epithelial cells and may be a potential target for the action of drugs in the management of prostate cancer.
inducible nitric oxide synthase appears and is co-expressed with the neuronal isoform in interneurons of the rat hippocampus after transient ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion we presently investigated the time-course of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and content in the rat striatum up to 6 days after ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, a condition that potentially allows functional recovery, with the aim to identify the cell types expressing these two enzymes and to correlate neuronal nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase changes in order to verify whether and how these changes are related to tissue damage, motor-sensory performances and survival. before and after surgery, the animals underwent neurological evaluation. the results demonstrated that the rats with a score > or = 12 at the neurological evaluation 24 h after ischemia showed a significant increase in neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones and absence of inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells and survived up to the sixth day; conversely, the rats with a score < 12 at the neurological evaluation 24 h after ischemia showed a progressive significant decrease in neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones and appearance of inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells and none of the rats survived up to the sixth day. microglia cells were activated in both groups but only in the latter did these cells express inducible nitric oxide synthase. measurement of the infarct area demonstrated that it occupied a similar territory in both groups of rats but in those with a score < 12 the edema was more extended. in conclusion, we demonstrated that a neurotoxic insult such as ischemia can induce neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression in the neurones and that when neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones increase in number, microglia activation is less extended, inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells are absent, tissue damage reduced and the rats survive longer. conversely, when there is a significant decrease of neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurones, microglia cells are intensely activated, inducible nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive cells appear and the animal survival is shortened.
the critical role of notch ligand delta-like 1 in the pathogenesis of influenza a virus (h1n1) infection viral infection often activates the interferon (ifn)-γ–inducible gene, nitric oxide synthase 2 (nos2). expression of nos2 can limit viral growth but may also suppress the immune system and damage tissue. this study assessed each of these effects in genetically deficient nos2−/− mice after infection with influenza a, a virus against which ifn-γ has no known activity. at inocula sufficient to cause consolidating pneumonitis and death in wild-type control mice, nos2−/− hosts survived with little histopathologic evidence of pneumonitis. moreover, they cleared influenza a virus from their lungs by an ifn-γ–dependent mechanism that was not evident in wild-type mice. even when the ifn-γ–mediated antiviral activity was blocked in nos2−/− mice with anti–ifn-γ mab, such mice failed to succumb to disease. further evidence that this protection was independent of viral load was provided by treating nos2+/+ mice with the nos inhibitor, n ω-methyl-l-arginine (l-nma). l-nma prevented mortality without affecting viral growth. thus, host nos2 seems to contribute more significantly to the development of influenza pneumonitis in mice than the cytopathic effects of viral replication. although nos2 mediates some antiviral effects of ifn-γ, during influenza infection it can suppress another ifn-γ–dependent antiviral mechanism. this mechanism was observed only in the complete absence of nos2 activity and appeared sufficient to control influenza a virus growth in the absence of changes in cytotoxic t lymphocyte activity.
a single nucleotide polymorphism in the umod promoter is associated with end stage renal disease chronic kidney disease (ckd) has a heritable component and is an important global public health problem because of its high prevalence and morbidity. we conducted genome-wide association studies (gwas) to identify susceptibility loci for glomerular filtration rate, estimated by serum creatinine (egfrcrea) and cystatin c (egfrcys), and ckd (egfrcrea < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) in european-ancestry participants of four population-based cohorts (aric, chs, fhs, rs; n = 19,877; 2,388 ckd cases), and tested for replication in 21,466 participants (1,932 ckd cases). we identified significant snp associations (p < 5 × 10−8) with ckd at the umod locus, with egfrcrea at umod, shroom3 and gatm-spata5l1, and with egfrcys at cst and stc1. umod encodes the most common protein in human urine, tamm-horsfall protein, and rare mutations in umod cause mendelian forms of kidney disease. our findings provide new insights into ckd pathogenesis and underscore the importance of common genetic variants influencing renal function and disease.
chromosomal alterations in oligodendroglial tumours over multiple surgeries: is tumour progression associated with change in 1p/19q status? although 1p/19q codeletions define “genetically favorable” oligodendrogliomas, eventual tumor progression and patient death remain constant. genetic testing is often performed at the time of recurrence, though it is unclear whether these or other genetic alterations provide useful prognostic information. we characterized 138 of 189 (73%) available primary and recurrent oligodendroglial neoplasms from 80 patients, utilizing paired fish probes for 1p32/1q42, 19p13/19q13, cep7/ egfr, cep9/p16, and pten/dmbt1. patients were followed until death (49%), or a median follow-up of 8.9 years. patients with 1p/19q codeleted tumors (71%) had an estimated overall median survival of 14.9 years with an estimated 3.9 years from first recurrence. in contrast, those lacking deletions had significantly lower estimated overall median survivals of 4.7 years and 1.0 year after first recurrence (both p < 0.001). this increased survival in patients with 1p/19q codeleted tumors remained significant when adjustments were made for age, tumor grade, type of surgical procedure, and treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. only 1 recurrence showed focal egfr amplification, while 5 developed 10q deletions, mostly in high-grade mixed oligoastrocytomas lacking 1p/19q deletions. in contrast, p16 (9p21) deletions were common and associated with both high grade (p < 0.001) and recurrence (p = 0.002). our data suggest that in classic oligodendrogliomas: 1) 1p/19q tumor status is a powerful predictor of patient survival, even after recurrence; 2) p16 deletions are common progression-associated alterations; and 3) 10q deletions and egfr amplifications are sufficiently rare to suggest the possibility of alternate diagnoses.
a new conservative-dynamic treatment for the acute ruptured achilles tendon background there is a lack of consensus regarding the best option for the treatment of acute achilles tendon rupture. treatment can be broadly classified as operative (open or percutaneous) or nonoperative (casting or functional bracing). postoperative splinting can be performed with a rigid cast (proximal or distal to the knee) or a more mobile functional brace. the aim of this meta-analysis was to identify and summarize the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the effectiveness of different interventions for the treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures.   methods we searched multiple databases (including embase, cinahl, and medline) as well as reference lists of articles and contacted authors. keywords included achilles tendon, rupture, and tendon injuries. three reviewers extracted data and independently assessed trial quality with use of a ten-item scale.   results twelve trials involving 800 patients were included. there was a variable level of methodological rigor and reporting of outcomes. open operative treatment was associated with a lower risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.64). however, it was associated with a higher risk of other complications, including infection, adhesions, and disturbed skin sensibility (relative risk, 10.60; 95% confidence interval, 4.82 to 23.28). percutaneous repair was associated with a lower complication rate compared with open operative repair (relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.62). patients who had been managed with a functional brace postoperatively (allowing for early mobilization) had a lower complication rate compared with those who had been managed with a cast (relative risk, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 2.76). because of the small number of patients involved, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different nonoperative treatment regimens.   conclusions open operative treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment, but operative treatment is associated with a significantly higher risk of other complications. operative risks may be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously. postoperative splinting with use of a functional brace reduces the overall complication rate.   level of evidence therapeutic level i.
a metapopulation modelling framework for gonorrhoea and other sexually transmitted infections in heterosexual populations spatial distribution of repeat and singly occurring gonorrhea in baltimore, maryland, was examined to identify clusters of core transmitters. gonorrhea reported between 2001 and 2002 was geocoded and mapped. those with more than one gonorrhea infection separated by more than 14 days during the 2-year period were considered repeaters. other cases were treated as isolated events. six definitions of core transmission were examined by census tracts with the highest quintiles of 1) cases for 2001, 2) cases for 2002, 3) rates for 2001, 4) rates for 2002, 5) counts of repeaters over the 2-year period, and 6) proportion of total cases that were repeaters. of the 6,108 gonorrhea cases analyzed, 9% were repeaters. repeaters were more likely to be female and younger. core areas identified by definitions based on overall disease burden agreed well with each other but had poor agreement with definitions based upon repeat infections. repeaters clustered to a greater extent at smaller distances than did singly occurring gonorrhea cases. repeat gonorrhea infections are prevalent in baltimore and likely represent behavior consistent with core transmission. census tracts of core transmission defined by geographic distribution of repeat infections may indicate foci of highest risk sexual behaviors and high transmission.
moderate alcohol intake is associated with decreased risk of insulin resistance among individuals with vitamin d insufficiency. the effects of a vitamin d deficiency on insulin and glucagon release was determined in the isolated perfused rat pancreas by radioimmunoassay of the secreted proteins. during a 30-minute period of perfusion with glucose and arginine, pancreases from vitamin d-deficient rats exhibited a 48 percent reduction in insulin secretion compared to that for pancreases from vitamin d-deficient rats that had been replenished with vitamin d. vitamin d status had no effect on pancreatic glucagon secretion. this result, along with the previously demonstrated presence in the pancreas of a vitamin d-dependent calcium-binding protein and cytosol receptor for the hormonal form of vitamin d, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3, indicates an important role for vitamin d in the endocrine functioning of the pancreas.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
sex differences in clinical presentation and response in panic disorder: pooled data from sertraline treatment studies unlabelled a gradual decline in estrogen levels after the age of 40 may contribute to a higher rate of depression in women over 45 years of age. estrogen replacement therapy (ert) has been shown to produce cognitive and mood-enhancing effects in women and may facilitate antidepressant activity.   methods we examined the efficacy rates in women on ert > or = 45 years (n = 40) compared to women > or = 45 years not on ert (n = 132) and to women < 45 years (n = 396) and to men (n = 262) with major depression during fluoxetine 20 mg daily up to 8 weeks. remitters with a ham-d17 score < or = 7 from week 9 to 12 were then treated up to 1-year in a placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial.   results efficacy rates were similar in women > or = 45 years on ert when compared to women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine alone, and when compared to women < 45 years and men taking fluoxetine. a kaplan-meier survival analysis in fluoxetine responders treated up to 26 weeks showed a somewhat greater relapse rate in women > or = 45 years taking ert compared to other treatment groups (p < 0.06).   limitations this study was retrospective nature and ert was given in an uncontrolled fashion: 63% of women received estrogen alone while 37% also took intermittent progesterone. other variables include the absence of hormonal documentation of menopausal status, no direct assessment of ert compliance and the use of fixed-dose fluoxetine 20 mg daily.   conclusion in contrast to prior reports suggesting that ert may facilitate antidepressant activity, we observed similar efficacy in depressed women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine plus ert compared to those taking fluoxetine alone.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
functional leaf traits and diurnal dynamics of photosynthetic parameters predict the behavior of grapevine varieties towards ozone using open-top chambers, the impact of ozone (o(3)) on foliar carboxylases of bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) was investigated. from sowing, beans were exposed to non-filtered air (nf) and nf supplied with 40 (+40) and 80 (+80) nl l(-1) o(3). twenty days after emergence, primary and first trifoliate leaves were sampled. biochemical characteristics of leaves from +40 were quite similar to those from nf. conversely, +80 induced distinct biochemical effects in primary and first trifoliate leaves. regarding primary leaves, +80 reduced ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) activity by 33% whereas it stimulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (pepc) activity by 376%. the reduction in rubisco activity was accompanied by a decrease in both rubisco subunit amounts and a consistent oxidative modification of the rubisco small subunit (ssu). these changes came with a drastic loss in pigmentation. regarding first trifoliate leaves, +80 stimulated rubisco activity by 33% while it disturbed neither pepc activity nor pigmentation. surprisingly, the enhanced rubisco activity was associated with a slight decrease in rubisco protein quantity, which was not coupled with the formation of carbonyl groups in rubisco-ssu.
behaviour management problems as predictors of psychotropic medication and use of psychiatric services in adults with autism &na; research into the pharmacotherapy of autistic disorder has steadily increased over the past two decades. several psychoactive medications have shown efficacy for selected symptoms of autistic disorder and can be used to augment critical educational and behavioral interventions that are the mainstays of treatment. a comprehensive review of medication trials conducted in individuals with autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders is presented. the typical antipsychotic haloperidol is the best‐studied medication in autistic disorder but is associated with a high rate of dyskinesias. investigations to date suggest that the atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone have efficacy for certain symptoms of autistic disorder and may be better tolerated than typical antipsychotics. preliminary results from trials with serotonin‐reuptake inhibitors are favorable, although efficacy has not been demonstrated in younger age groups. recent controlled studies of naltrexone suggest that the drug has minimal efficacy. in two small controlled investigations, clonidine was more effective than placebo for a variety of symptoms, including hyperactivity and irritability; in one of these studies, however, the majority of patients relapsed within several months. psychostimulants reduced hyperactivity and irritability in one small double‐blind crossover study in children with autistic disorder, although these agents are frequently reported to exacerbate irritability, insomnia, and aggression in clinical populations. recent controlled trials of secretin have not shown efficacy compared to placebo. several other medications, including buspirone, mood stabilizers, and g ‐blockers, have produced symptom reduction in some open‐label studies and may warrant controlled investigation.
effects of viruses and predators on prokaryotic community composition viral lysis of specific bacterial populations has been suggested to be an important factor for structuring marine bacterioplankton communities. in the present study, the influence of bacteriophages on the diversity and population dynamics of four marine bacterial phage-host systems was studied experimentally in continuous cultures and theoretically by a mathematical model. by use of whole genome dna hybridization toward community dna, we analyzed the dynamics of individual bacterial host populations in response to the addition of their specific phage in continuous cultures of mixed bacterial assemblages. in these experiments, viral lysis had only temporary effects on the dynamics and diversity of the individual bacterial host species. following the initial lysis of sensitive host cells, growth of phage-resistant clones of the added bacteria resulted in a distribution of bacterial strains in the phage-enriched culture that was similar to that in the control culture without phages after about 50-60 h incubation. consequently, after a time frame of 5-10 generations after lysis, it was the interspecies competition rather than viral lysis of specific bacterial strains that was the driving force in the regulation of bacterial species composition in these experiments. the clonal diversity, on the other hand, was strongly influenced by viral activity, since the clonal composition of the four species in the phage-enriched culture changed completely from phage-sensitive to phage-resistant clones. the model simulation predicted that viral lysis had a strong impact on the population dynamics, the species composition, and the clonal composition of the bacterial community over longer time scales (weeks). however, according to the model, the overall density of bacteria in the system was not affected by phages, since resistant clones complemented the fluctuations caused by viral lysis. based on the model analysis, we therefore suggest that viral lysis can have a strong influence on the dynamics of bacterial populations in planktonic marine systems.
urinary albumin and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine as markers of mortality and cardiovascular disease during 19 years after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes – a comparative study of two markers to identify high risk patients background—for the general population, the clinical relevance of an increased urinary albumin excretion rate is still debated. therefore, we examined the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and all-cause mortality and mortality caused by cardiovascular (cv) disease and non-cv disease in the general population. methods and results—in the period 1997 to 1998, all inhabitants of the city of groningen, the netherlands, aged between 28 and 75 years (n=85 421) were sent a postal questionnaire collecting information about risk factors for cv disease and cv morbidity and a vial to collect an early morning urine sample for measurement of urinary albumin concentration (uac). the vital status of the cohort was subsequently obtained from the municipal register, and the cause of death was obtained from the central bureau of statistics. of these 85 421 subjects, 40 856 (47.8%) responded, and 40 548 could be included in the analysis. during a median follow-up period of 961 days (maximum 1139 days), 516 deaths with known cause were recorded. we found a positive dose-response relationship between increasing uac and mortality. a higher uac increased the risk of both cv and non-cv death after adjustment for other well-recognized cv risk factors, with the increase being significantly higher for cv mortality than for non-cv mortality (p =0.014). a 2-fold increase in uac was associated with a relative risk of 1.29 for cv mortality (95% ci 1.18 to 1.40) and 1.12 (95% ci 1.04 to 1.21) for non-cv mortality. conclusions—urinary albumin excretion is a predictor of all-cause mortality in the general population. the excess risk was more attributable to death from cv causes, independent of the effects of other cv risk factors, and the relationship was already apparent at levels of albuminuria currently considered to be normal.
outcome of microdissection tese compared with conventional tese in non‐obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
clostridium difficile heterogeneously impacts intestinal community architecture but drives stable metabolome responses defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community–host interaction. metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to ‘fingerprint’ microbiota functional status. here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (hum) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based method. differences between hum and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota’s metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding hum mice, and individual-specific features suggest ‘personalized’ aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) expression in human malignant gliomas contributes to immune escape and tumour progression macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) was originally identified several decades ago as a lymphokine-derived protein that inhibited monocyte migration. recently, it has been reported that mif has d-dopachrome tautomerase, phenylpyruvate tautomerase and thiol protein oxidoreductase activities, although the physiological significance of those activities is not yet clear. here we show that mif is able to catalyze the conversion of dopaminechrome and norepinephrinechrome, toxic quinone products of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, respectively, to indole derivatives that may serve as precursors to neuromelanin. since mif is highly expressed in human brain, these observations raise the possibility that mif participates in a detoxification pathway for catecholamine products and could therefore have an important role for neural tissues. the potential role of mif in the formation of neuromelanin from catecholamines is also an extremely interesting possibility.
identification of novel transcription factors regulating secondary cell wall formation in arabidopsis members of the large arabidopsis nac domain transcription factor family are regulators of meristem development, organ elongation and separation, and deposition of patterned secondary cell walls. xylem nac domain 1 (xnd1) is highly expressed in xylem. changes observed for xnd1 knockout plants compared with wild-type arabidopsis thaliana included a reduction in both plant height and tracheary element length and an increase in metaxylem relative to protoxylem in roots of plants treated with the proteasome inhibitor mg132. overexpression of xnd1 resulted in extreme dwarfism associated with the absence of xylem vessels and little or no expression of tracheary element marker genes. in contrast, phloem marker-gene expression was not altered and phloem-type cells still formed. transmission electron microscopy showed that parenchyma-like cells in the incipient xylem zone in hypocotyls of xnd1 overexpressors lacked secondary wall thickenings and retained their cytoplasmic content. considered together, these findings suggest that xnd1 affects tracheary element growth through regulation of secondary wall synthesis and programmed cell death.
multicenter phase ii trial of genexol-pm, a cremophor-free, polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel, in patients with metastatic breast cancer purpose between february 1993 and september 1995, 739 patients with metastatic breast cancer were entered on an intergroup trial (e1193) comparing doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)), paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)/24 h), and the combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel (at, 50 mg/m(2) and 150 mg/m(2)/24 h, plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 mg/kg) as first-line therapy. patients receiving single-agent doxorubicin or paclitaxel were crossed over to the other agent at time of progression.   patients and methods patients were well balanced for on-study characteristics.   results responses (complete response and partial response) were seen in 36% of doxorubicin, 34% of paclitaxel, and 47% of at patients (p =.84 for doxorubicin v paclitaxel, p =.007 for v at, p =.004 for paclitaxel v at). median time to treatment failure (ttf) is 5.8, 6.0, and 8.0 months for doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and at, respectively (p =.68 for doxorubicin v paclitaxel, p =.003 for doxorubicin v at, p =.009 for paclitaxel v at). median survivals are 18.9 months for patients taking doxorubicin, 22.2 months for patients taking paclitaxel, and 22.0 months for patients taking at (p = not significant). responses were seen in 20% of patients crossing from doxorubicin --> paclitaxel and 22% of patients crossing from paclitaxel --> doxorubicin (p = not significant). changes in global quality-of-life measurements from on-study to week 16 were similar in all three groups.   conclusion (1) doxorubicin and paclitaxel, in the doses used here, have equivalent activity; (2) the combination of at results in superior overall response rates and time to ttf; and (3) despite these results, combination therapy with at did not improve either survival or quality of life compared to sequential single-agent therapy.
a novel and selective sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor, tofogliflozin, improves glycaemic control and lowers body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aims/hypothesisthe aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin vs placebo and sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with background metformin.methodsthis randomised, double-blind, four-arm, parallel-group, phase 3 study was conducted at 169 centres in 22 countries between april 2010 and august 2012. participants (n = 1,284) with type 2 diabetes aged ≥18 and ≤80 years who had inadequate glycaemic control (hba1c ≥7.0% [53 mmol/mol] and ≤10.5% [91 mmol/mol]) on metformin therapy received canagliflozin 100 mg or 300 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or placebo (n = 368, 367, 366, 183, respectively) for a 26 week, placebo- and active-controlled period followed by a 26 week, active-controlled period (placebo group switched to sitagliptin [placebo/sitagliptin]) and were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis set. randomisation was performed using a computer-generated schedule; participants, study centres and the sponsor were blinded to group assignment. the primary endpoint was change from baseline in hba1c at week 26; secondary endpoints included changes in hba1c (week 52) and fasting plasma glucose (fpg), body weight, and systolic blood pressure (bp; weeks 26 and 52). adverse events (aes) were recorded throughout the study.resultsat week 26, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg reduced hba1c vs placebo (−0.79%, –0.94%, –0.17%, respectively; p < 0.001). at week 52, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg demonstrated non-inferiority, and canagliflozin 300 mg demonstrated statistical superiority, to sitagliptin in lowering hba1c (−0.73%, –0.88%,–0.73%, respectively); differences (95% ci) vs sitagliptin were 0% (−0.12, 0.12) and −0.15% (−0.27, –0.03), respectively. canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg reduced body weight vs placebo (week 26: –3.7%, –4.2%, –1.2%, respectively; p < 0.001) and sitagliptin (week 52: –3.8%, –4.2%, –1.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). both canagliflozin doses reduced fpg and systolic bp vs placebo (week 26) and sitagliptin (week 52) (p < 0.001). overall ae and ae-related discontinuation rates were generally similar across groups, but higher with canagliflozin 100 mg. genital mycotic infection and osmotic diuresis-related ae rates were higher with canagliflozin; few led to discontinuations. hypoglycaemia incidence was higher with canagliflozin.conclusions/interpretationcanagliflozin improved glycaemia and reduced body weight vs placebo (week 26) and sitagliptin (week 52) and was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin.clinical trial registryclinicaltrials.gov nct01106677fundingthis study was supported by janssen research & development, llc.
cannabinoid receptor and win-55,212-2-stimulated [35s]gtpγs binding and cannabinoid receptor mrna levels in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum of adult male rats chronically exposed to δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol the active ingredient of marijuana is (-)-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-thc). delta 9-thc and other natural and synthetic cannabinoids such as cp-55,940 inhibit spontaneous activity and produce catalepsy in animals in a receptor-mediated fashion. tolerance develops to the motor effects of delta 9-thc after repeated administration. to test the hypothesis that tolerance is mediated by changes in cannabinoid receptor binding characteristics, we used quantitative in vitro autoradiography of [3h]cp-55,940 binding to striatal brain sections from rats treated either chronically or acutely with delta 9-thc, cp-55,940, or the inactive natural cannabinoid cannabidiol. in the chronic conditions, rats were given daily i.p. injections of delta 9-thc (10 mg/kg), cannabidiol (10 mg/kg), or cp-55,940 (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks and sacrificed 30 min after the last injection. in the acute condition, animals received a single dose (10 mg/kg) prior to sacrifice. rats developed tolerance to the inhibitory effects of delta 9-thc and cp-55,940, assayed in an open field on days 1, 7, and 14. cannabidiol had no effect on behavior. densitometry of [3h]cp-55,940 binding to brain sections showed that delta 9-thc- and cp-55,940-treated animals had homogeneous decreases in binding in all structures measured at the selected striatal levels. cannabidiol had no effect on binding. analysis of binding parameters showed that alterations in the acute condition were attributed to changes in affinity (kd), whereas the major changes in the chronic condition were attributed to a lowering of capacity (bmax). the effects in the 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg cp-55,940 conditions were dose-dependent and paralleled the behavioral data showing that the animals given the highest dose developed the greatest degree of tolerance. the data suggest that tolerance to cannabinoids results at least in part from agonist-induced receptor down-regulation.

transcription of liver x receptor is down-regulated by 15-deoxy-δ12,14-prostaglandin j2 through oxidative stress in human neutrophils 15-deoxy-δ12,14-prostaglandin j2 (15dpgj2 has been recently proposed as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. however, the mechanisms by which 15dpgj2 mediates its therapeutic effects in vivo are unclear. we demonstrate that 15dpgj2 at micromolar (2.5–10 μm) concentrations induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1), an anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both mrna and protein levels in human lymphocytes. in contrast, troglitazone and ciglitazone, two thiazolidinediones that mimic several effects of 15dpgj2 through their binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-γ, did not affect ho-1 expression, and the positive effect of 15dpgj2 on this process was mimicked instead by other cyclopentenone prostaglandins (pg), such as pgd2 (the precursor of 15dpgj2) and pga1 and pga2 which do not interact with ppar-γ. also, 15dpgj2 enhanced the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and increased xanthine oxidase activity in vitro. inhibition of intracellular ros production by n-acetylcysteine, tempo, me2so, 1,10-phenanthroline, or allopurinol resulted in a decreased 15dpgj2-dependent ho-1 expression in the cells. furthermore, buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of reduced glutathione synthesis, or fe2+/cu2+ ions enhanced the positive effect of 15dpgj2 on ho-1 expression. on the other hand, the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, or the blockade of transcription factor nf-κb activation, hindered 15dpgj2-elicited ho-1 expression. collectively, the present data suggest that 15dpgj2 anti-inflammatory actions at pharmacological concentrations involve the induction of ho-1 gene expression through mechanisms independent of ppar-γ activation and dependent on ros produced via the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and/or through fenton reactions. both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways also appear implicated in modulation of ho-1 expression by 15dpgj2.
antibody-mediated osseous regeneration for bone tissue engineering in canine segmental defects recently, it has been shown that tethered anti-bmp2 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) can trap bmp ligands and thus provide bmp inductive signals for osteo-differentiation of progenitor cells. the objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a co-delivery system based on murine anti-bmp2 mab-loaded alginate microspheres encapsulating human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hbmmscs); and (2) investigate osteogenic differentiation of encapsulated stem cells in alginate microspheres in vitro and in vivo. alginate microspheres of 1 ± 0.1 mm diameter were fabricated with 2 × 10(6) hbmmscs per ml of alginate. critical-size calvarial defects (5 mm diameter) were created in immune-compromised mice and alginate microspheres preloaded with anti-bmp mab encapsulating hbmmscs were transplanted into defect sites. alginate microspheres pre-loaded with isotype-matched non-specific antibody were used as the negative control. after 8 weeks, micro ct and histologic analyses were used to analyze bone formation. in vitro analysis demonstrated that anti-bmp2 mabs tethered bmp2 ligands that can activate the bmp receptors on hbmmscs. the co-delivery system described herein, significantly enhanced hbmmsc-mediated osteogenesis, as confirmed by the presence of bmp signal pathway-activated osteoblast determinants runx2 and alp. our results highlight the importance of engineering the microenvironment for stem cells, and particularly the value of presenting inductive signals for osteo-differentiation of hbmmscs by tethering bmp ligands using mabs. this strategy of engineering the microenvironment with captured bmp signals is a promising modality for repair and regeneration of craniofacial, axial and appendicular bone defects.
lean mass appears to be more strongly associated with bone health than fat mass in urban black south african women background the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral density (bmd) in postmenopausal and perimenopausal thai women. methods a cross-sectional study was conducted in 1579 healthy thai women aged 40–90 years. total body, lumbar spine, total femur, and femoral neck bmd and body composition were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. to evaluate the associations between fat mass and lean mass and various measures of bmd, multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the regression coefficients for fat mass and lean mass, first in separate equations and then with both fat mass and lean mass in the same equation. results among the study population, 1448 subjects (91.7%) were postmenopausal and 131 (8.3%) were perimenopausal. in postmenopausal women, after controlling for age, height, and duration of menopause, both fat mass and lean mass were positively correlated with bmd when they were analyzed independently of each other. when included in the same equation, both fat mass and lean mass continued to show a positive effect, but lean mass had a significantly greater impact on bmd than fat mass at all regions except for total body. lean mass but not fat mass had a positive effect on bmd at all skeletal sites except the lumbar spine, after controlling for age and height in perimenopausal women. conclusion lean mass had a significant beneficial effect on bmd in both postmenopausal and perimenopausal women and can be considered as one of the determinants of bone mass. the effect of the fat mass was related to menopausal status, but only demonstrated a positive impact in perimenopausal women.
reversibility and regioselectivity in thiol/disulfide interchange of tocinoic acid with glutathione in lyophilized solids. methodology is described for characterization of the kinetics and equilibria of thiol/disulfide interchange reactions of the disulfide bonds in the neurohypophyseal peptide hormones arginine vasopressin and oxytocin and the related peptides pressinoic acid and tocinoic acid. thiol/disulfide interchange reaction mixtures are analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. the effect of mobile-phase composition and ph on the hplc capacity factors for the native disulfide and reduced dithiol forms of each peptide was examined. in each case, the capacity factor decreases as the acetonitrile content of the mobile phase increases. for each disulfide/dithiol peptide pair, the capacity factor is larger for the dithiol form of the peptide, indicating that the hydrophobic side chains of the linear peptide are more accessible for interaction with the hydrophobic stationary phase. to illustrate application of the methodology, rate and equilibrium constants are reported for the thiol/disulfide interchange reactions of cysteine with arginine vasopressin at ph 7.0. cysteine reacts with arginine vasopressin to form two mixed disulfides, which in turn react with another molecule of cysteine to give the dithiol form of arginine vasopressin and cystine. rate and equilibrium constants were determined for each step by analysis of reaction mixtures by hplc. the results are compared to rate and equilibrium constants for reaction of cysteine with oxidized glutathione.

opioid modulation of value-based decision-making in healthy humans decision-making consists of selecting an action from a set of available options. this results in an outcome that changes the state of the decision-maker. therefore, decision-making is part of a homeostatic process. individuals with psychiatric disorders show altered decision-making. they select options that are either non-optimal or nonhomeostatic. these dysfunctional patterns of decision-making in individuals with psychiatric disorders may fundamentally relate to problems with homeostatic regulation. these may manifest themselves in (i) how the length of time between decisions and their outcomes influences subsequent decision-making, (ii) how gain and loss feedback are integrated to determine the optimal decision, (iii) how individuals adapt their decision strategies to match the specific context, or (iv) how seemingly maladaptive responses result from an attempt to establish an unstable homeostatic balance.
correction: genetic variants in microrna machinery genes are associate with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss risk recent compelling evidence indicates that mutation, aberrant expression, and dysregulation of microrna (mirna) biogenesis are implicated in cancer development and progression. based on the important role of mirna biogenesis pathway in carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that genetic variations in this pathway genes may play a role as susceptibility factors for breast cancer. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the associations between 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in 14 genes involved in mirna biogenesis pathway and breast cancer risk in a case–control study of 559 korean breast cancer cases and 567 controls frequency-matched by age. in all women, 3 snps (ago1 rs595055, ago2 rs3864659, and p68 rs1991401) were significantly associated with breast cancer risk. in stratified analysis by menopausal status, altered risk associations were observed for 7 snps in postmenopausal breast cancer. when subjects were grouped by the number of high-risk genotypes, we found a progressive increase in gene-dosage effect (ptrend = 9.46e−7). the protective effects of ago2 rs3864659 and hiwi rs11060845 were more pronounced in progesterone receptor-positive (pr+) cancer than in progesterone receptor-negative (pr−) cancer (odds ratio (or), 0.50; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.30–0.84 vs. or, 0.94; 95% ci, 0.60–1.84; pheterogeneity = 0.04 and or, 0.57; 95% ci, 0.37–0.88 vs. or, 0.97; 95% ci, 0.65–1.44; pheterogeneity = 0.02, respectively), and the drosha rs644236 had stronger association with estrogen receptor-negative (er−) cancer than for estrogen receptor-positive (er+) cancer (or, 1.39; 95% ci, 1.08–1.78 vs. or, 1.05; 95% ci, 0.85–1.29; pheterogeneity = 0.04). our results suggest that genetic variants in mirna biogenesis pathway genes may be associated with breast cancer risk, and the modifiable effects might be different according to the menopausal status and hormone receptor status.
effects of trypsin-digested outer-arm dynein fragments on the velocity of microtubule sliding in elastase-digested flagellar axonemes. conformational changes of dynein during atp hydrolysis are demonstrated by the difference in the tryptic fragments of the dynein heavy chain between in the absence and presence of atp and vanadate. here tryptic sites in the presence of atp and vanadate (tav sites) have been mapped on the betaheavy chain of outer arm dynein from sea urchin sperm flagella. tav sites are located not only near the central catalytic domain which includes four p-loops, but also near the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region. the tav2 site is located in the most carboxyl-terminal region, which is nearly 850 amino acid residues apart from the the fourth p-loop (p4 site). the region from the most amino-terminal tav site (tav1 site) to the tav2 site covers approximately 2,100 amino acid residues, which is almost half the whole betaheavy chain. comparison of the sequences around the tryptic sites of the sea urchin b chain and those of the dynein heavy chains from other organisms reveals that the sequence around the tav1 site is highly conserved in both cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins but that around tav2 sites is only conserved in axonemal dyneins, suggesting functional differences in the tav2 region between the two subfamilies of dynein.
effects of heat exposure on muscle oxidation and protein functionalities of pectoralis majors in broilers. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chemical oxidation on proteolysis susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins. myofibrils were prepared from pig m. longissimus dorsi and oxidised by a hydroxyl radical generating system. protein oxidation level was measured by the carbonyl content, free thiol group content and bityrosine formation. oxidised or non-oxidised myofibrillar proteins were exposed to papain and proteolysis was estimated by fluorescence using fluorescamine. oxidation of myofibrillar proteins was dependent upon the oxidising agent concentration. disulfide bridge and bityrosine formation indicated that oxidation by oh° can induce protein polymerization. electrophoretic study showed that myosin was the protein most sensitive to oxidation. results showed a direct and quantitative relationship between protein damages by hydroxyl radical and decreased proteolytic susceptibility. electrophoretic observations suggest that polymerization and aggregation may explain in part decreased susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins to proteolysis.
vision and locomotion shape the interactions between neuron types in mouse visual cortex the brain's response to sensory input is strikingly modulated by behavioral state. notably, the visual response of mouse primary visual cortex (v1) is enhanced by locomotion, a tractable and accessible example of a time-locked change in cortical state. the neural circuits that transmit behavioral state to sensory cortex to produce this modulation are unknown. in vivo calcium imaging of behaving animals revealed that locomotion activates vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip)-positive neurons in mouse v1 independent of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from basal forebrain. optogenetic activation of vip neurons increased v1 visual responses in stationary awake mice, artificially mimicking the effect of locomotion, and photolytic damage of vip neurons abolished the enhancement of v1 responses by locomotion. these findings establish a cortical circuit for the enhancement of visual response by locomotion and provide a potential common circuit for the modulation of sensory processing by behavioral state.
inhibitors of c-jun phosphorylation impede ovine primordial follicle activation. foxo transcription factors have been implicated in diverse biological processes, including metabolism, cellular stress responses, and aging. here, we show that foxo3a–/– female mice exhibit a distinctive ovarian phenotype of global follicular activation leading to oocyte death, early depletion of functional ovarian follicles, and secondary infertility. foxo3a thus functions at the earliest stages of follicular growth as a suppressor of follicular activation. in addition to providing a molecular entry point for studying the regulation of follicular growth, these results raise the possibility that accelerated follicular initiation plays a role in premature ovarian failure, a common cause of infertility and premature aging in women.
increased sparsity of hippocampal ca1 neuronal ensembles in a mouse model of down syndrome assayed by arc expression we have assessed the effects of enriched environment (ee) upon behavioral and cognitive performances of partially trisomic ts65dn (ts) mice and their control (co) littermates. enriched environment was applied to pups for 7 weeks after weaning. circadian spontaneous activity (actimetry), exploratory behavior (hole board), activity in the open field and spatial memory (morris water maze, repeated acquisition and cued paradigms) were analyzed in 86 female and 75 male mice, starting 15 days after completing enrichment. for each gender, mice were distributed in non-enriched and enriched control and trisomic groups. enriched environment reduced in trisomic females and enhanced in trisomic males' circadian activity. exploratory behavior was increased by enrichment in all groups, regardless of gender or presence of trisomy. in the morris water maze, a significant improvement of the spatial memory was observed in enriched-control females, but not in enriched-control male mice, as assessed by distances traveled. performances in the four groups of control animals were also consistently and significantly better than those of matching trisomic mice. in the acquisition trials, enrichment improved performance in trisomic female animals, but deteriorated in trisomic male mice. in all groups, changes in escape latencies and distances induced by enrichment were accounted for by changes in the total time spent in the periphery of the pool, indicating changes in learning strategy. working memory was the function more affected by enrichment. it is concluded that enriched environment induces behavioral and learning changes in trisomic mice, although gender plays a significant modulatory role.
urban and rural disparity in tobacco use and knowledge about oral cancer among adolescents: an epidemiological survey on 12 and 15-year school going students background: tobacco consumption is one of the major pre­ ventable causes of tobacco related cancer. in india, tobacco related cancer accounts for half the total cancer cases among males and 20% of the cancer cases among women. the preval­ ence of tobacco consumption among the tribal youths is high. aim: to know the prevalence and the pattern of tobacco con­ sumption among the adolescents of tribal areas. settings: five tribal villages under the primary health centre, waradh, in the district yavatmal, maharashtra state, india. design: a community based cross sectional study. methods and material: the study consisted of 502 adolescents of both the sexes. the data was collected on a predesigned proforma during the period from october 2009 to september 2010. after obtaining the consent of the subjects, the information which was related to their socio­demographic characteristics and tobacco consumption was collected. the statistical analysis was done by using the chi square test and percentage. results: overall, the prevalence of tobacco consumption among the adolescents of the tribal areas was 45.42%. 65.31% male and 26.46% female adolescents were habituated to it. all female, and majority of the male adolescents predominantly consumed a smokeless form of tobacco. most of them (89%) started chewing tobacco / gutkha between 5­15 years of age. the females had started consuming tobacco at younger ages than the males. social customs were the major influencing factor for the tobacco consumption, followed by peer pressure. the consumption of tobacco among the family members significantly (p<0.001) increased the tobacco use among the adolescents. conclusion: the prevalence of tobacco consumption was high in the tribal adolescents. social customs, peer pressure and the consumption of tobacco by the family members were the major contributing factors which emphasized the need of strengthening the information, education and communication (iec) activities.
association of grm7 variants with different phenotype patterns of age-related hearing impairment in an elderly male han chinese population the grainyhead‐like 2 gene (grhl2) was found to be associated with age‐related hearing impairment (arhi) in europeans. we tested whether the same association exists in the han chinese population.
distinct lymph nodal sonographic characteristics in breast cancer patients at high risk for axillary metastases correlate with the final axillary stage. backgroundsonographically directed fine-needle aspiration is a less invasive and less costly alternative to sentinel node (sn) mapping in breast cancer patients at high risk for metastatic disease but with clinically negative axillae.methodsradiographic, cytological, and histological diagnostic data on breast primary tumors from 114 consecutive sn candidates were prospectively assessed for clinicopathologic variables associated with an increased incidence of axillary metastases. patients in whom these variables were identified underwent sonographic examination of their axillae followed by fine-needle aspiration when abnormal nodes were detected. sn mapping was performed in patients with normal axillary sonogram results or negative cytological results. patients with positive cytological results proceeded to complete axillary dissection. final axillary histological outcomes from patients not meeting the high-risk criteria were recorded. additionally, a cost analysis was performed in which the costs of ultrasonography and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the axilla were compared with those of sn mapping.resultsaccording to our selection criteria, a third of the patients with clinically negative axillae (37 of 114; 32%) were considered at high risk for axillary metastases. fifty-nine percent of these patients (22 of 37) had metastatic disease on final histological analysis. forty percent (15 of 37) of high-risk patients were spared sn mapping, with a reduction in health care costs of 20% in this patient population. eighty-seven percent of patients not meeting high-risk criteria were sn negative.conclusionsthis study suggests that in patients at increased risk for axillary metastases, the use of sonographic evaluation of the axilla in combination with fine-needle aspiration is not only clinically justified, but also cost-effective.
cannabinoid modulation of memory consolidation in rats: beyond the role of cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 during the last eight years a number of bioactive lipid mediators, the amides or esters of long chain fatty acids, have been discovered or re-discovered. these are: anandamide (n-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine, aea) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-ag), two endogenous agonists of cannabinoid receptors; oleamide (cis-9-octadecenoamide), a putative endogenous sleep-inducing factor; n-palmitoylethanol amine (pea), a compound with promising anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activity. these compounds are all substrates for the same hydrolytic enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah), whose molecular characterization was obtained in 1996. the molecular and enzymatic properties, tissue distribution, substrate recognition properties, physiological regulation and biological role of faah are discussed in this article, with special emphasis on the possible pharmacological manipulation of the activity of this enzyme with therapeutic purpose.
the effect of progressive eccentric and concentric training on functional performance after autogenous hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomized controlled study. we report isokinetic results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon or hamstring graft from the literature analysis. the literature was defined from two search "textwords": isokinetic and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and from three databases: medline, pascal, and herasmus. two independent physicians (physical medicine and rehabilitation) carried out an analysis according to the french national accreditation and health evaluation agency recommendations. fifty-three studies were selected: 29 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft, 15 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring graft, and 9 studies compared the two surgical procedures. after discussing different bias and in reference to prospective randomised and comparative studies, the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft involves a knee extensors deficit during several months. the hamstring surgical procedure involves a less important knee extensor deficit (from 6 to 19 % against 8 to 21 %). knee sprain and intra-articular surgery involve a long-lasting knee extensors deficit. anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings graft involves a knee flexors deficit over several months. the patellar tendon surgical procedure involves a less important knee flexors deficit (from 1 to 15 % against 5 to 17 %). in reference to isokinetic parameters, no difference between the two surgical procedures (patellar tendon graft or hamstring graft) is shown after more than twenty-four post-surgical months.
immunohistochemical expression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cystoprostatectomies with incidental and insignificant prostate cancer. further evidence for field effect in prostatic carcinogenesis. diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is usually not difficult in biopsy specimens. problems may occur in biopsy specimens, containing only a few suspicious lesions. recently, p504s has been tested as a new marker for prostatic carcinoma. when over-expressed in atypical glands without basal cells, it establishes the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma. we analysed the staining intensity of p504s in 208 biopsy specimens from prostates (1) with adenocarcinoma (n=132), (2) with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (hgpin) with adenocarcinoma (n=36), (3) with hgpin alone (n=40) and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to (n=54) or distant from adenocarcinoma (n=64). p504s expression was negative to weakly positive in biopsy specimens showing hgpin without carcinoma and weakly positive in radical prostatectomy specimens revealing hgpin distant from adenocarcinoma. in biopsy specimens with a combination of hgpin and adenocarcinoma and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to adenocarcinoma, p504s was strongly expressed. the same findings were made in radical prostatectomy specimens containing adenocarcinoma and hgpin adjacent to or distant from adenocarcinoma and in preoperative biopsies revealing adenocarcinoma and hgpin. these results suggest that moderate to strong p504s expression in hgpin of biopsy specimens is indicative of an associated adenocarcinoma and may be helpful in the choice of therapy.

absence of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, pecam-1/cd31, in vivo increases resistance to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in mice in the human gut mucosa, specialized m cells deliver intact foreign macromolecules and commensal bacteria from the lumen to organized mucosal lymphoid tissues triggering immune responses. m cells are also major sites of adhesion and invasion for enteric pathogens. the molecular features of m cell apical surfaces that promote microbial normal attachment are still largely unknown. we have demonstrated previously that in the human colonic epithelium, carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) and cea-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (ceacam1) are integral components of the apical glycocalyx which participate in epithelial–microbial interactions. in this study, based on the reactivity of specific monoclonal antibodies and on immunoelectron microscopy, we show that m cells of human colonic solitary lymphoid follicles express cea and ceacam1 on the apical surface. recently these highly glycosylated molecules have been characterized as protein receptors for different bacteria. this leads us to propose a role for cea and ceacam1 in the adherence of enteric bacteria to the apical membrane of colonic m cells. we also hypothesize that, unlike colonic enterocytes, m cells lack the defense mechanism that eliminates cea and ceacam1 upon microbial binding and which is based on vesiculation of microvillus plasma membrane.
alkamide production from hairy root cultures of echinacea efficient plant regeneration was achieved via organogenesis from callus cultures derived from leaf tissue of echinacea purpurea. proliferating shoot cultures were obtained by placing leaf explants on murashige and skoog (ms) medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine (bap) and naphthaleneacetic acid (naa) combinations. ms medium supplemented with bap (4.44 μm) and naa (0.054 μm) was the most effective, providing high shoot regeneration frequencies (100%) associated with a high number of shoots per explant (7.7 shoots/explant). plantlets were rooted on ms medium alone or in combination with different concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (iba), and high rooting and survival was achieved using ms media without plant growth regulators (pgr). all plantlets survived acclimatization producing healthy plants in the greenhouse. this study demonstrated that adventitious shoot regeneration of e. purpurea from leaf explants can be a useful method for the multiplication of this important medicinal plant.
bone ultrasonography in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis objective with increasing life span osteoporosis becomes a more recognized problem in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). the aim of this cross-sectional study in 75 adult patients with cf (mean age 25.3 years) was to assess the prevalence of low bone mineral density (bmd) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) and, for the first time, by quantitative ultrasound (qus), and to identify predicting factors.   design and methods bone status was assessed at the lumbar spine (l2-l4) and the femoral neck by dexa, and at the calcaneus by qus (stiffness index). these data were correlated with a variety of clinical and anthropomorphic variables. biochemical markers of bone turnover such as osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, crosslinks in urine, 25-hydroxy vitamin d (25-oh vitamin d), parathyroid hormone, calcium and free testosterone were determined by standard assays.   results the mean bmd t score (+/-s.e.m.) was -1.4+/-0.17 at the lumbar spine, and -0.54+/-0.16 at the femoral neck. the mean t score of the calcaneal stiffness index was -0.83+/-0.19. based on a lumbar spine t score <-2.5 by dexa, 27% of the patients had osteoporosis. multiple regression analysis showed that the forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) and the use of oral glucocorticoids were independent predictors of low lumbar spine bmd, whereas body mass index (bmi) and the use of oral glucocorticoids were independent predictors of low femoral neck bmd. the stiffness index correlated moderately with bmd (0.49-0.62, p<0.0001). qus had a sensitivity and specificity of only 57% and 89% respectively for diagnosing 'osteoporosis' (based on a femoral neck t score <-2.5 by dexa). positive and negative predictive values were 36% and 95% respectively.   conclusions low bmd is frequent in adults with cf and is most strongly correlated with disease severity (bmi, fev1) and the use of glucocorticoids. calcaneal qus might help to screen out patients with a normal bmd, but sensitivity and specificity were not sufficiently high to replace dexa in these patients.
hmgi(y) and hmgi-c genes are expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors and affect retinoic acid responsiveness. retinoic acid (ra) induces the neuronal differentiation of many human neuroblastoma cell lines. in this study, we show that ra treatment of neuroblastoma cells induces the expression of trkb, the receptor for the neurotrophins bdnf, nt-3, and nt-4/5. bdnf addition to ra-treated sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of trkb and neuronal differentiation. ra treatment of kcnr neuroblastoma cells, which constitutively express bdnf mrna, resulted in the expression of trkb and differentiation in the absence of added bdnf. finally, in 15n neuroblastoma cells, which express bdnf mrna but do not differentiate in response to ra, ra induced only a truncated form of trkb. 15n cells transfected with full-length trkb differentiated in the absence of ra. these results indicate that ra induces the neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells by modulating the expression of neurotrophin receptors.
an ensemble model that combines syntactic and semantic clustering for discriminative dependency parsing we present an effective training algorithm for linearly-scored dependency parsers that implements online large-margin multi-class training (crammer and singer, 2003; crammer et al., 2003) on top of efficient parsing techniques for dependency trees (eisner, 1996). the trained parsers achieve a competitive dependency accuracy for both english and czech with no language specific enhancements.
nucleotide diversity and molecular evolution of the psy1 gene in zea mays compared to some other grass species several authors have proposed that changes in a small number of regulatory genes may be sufficient for the evolution of novel morphologies. recent analyses have indicated that teosinte branched1 (tb1), a putative bhlh transcription factor, played such a role during the morphological evolution of maize from its wild ancestor, teosinte. to address whether or not tb1 played a similar role during the evolution of the andropogoneae, the tribe to which maize belongs, and to examine the rate and pattern of tb1 evolution within this tribe, we analyzed tb1-like sequences from 23 members of the andropogoneae and five other grasses. our analysis revealed that the tb1 protein evolves slowly within three conserved domains but rapidly outside these domains. the nonconserved regions of the gene are characterized by both a high nonsynonymous substitution rate and frequent indels. the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (d(n)) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (d(s)) was not significantly greater than 1.0, providing no evidence for positive selection. however, the d(n)/d(s) ratio varied significantly among lineages and was high compared with those of other plant nuclear genes. variation in the d(n)/d(s) ratio among the andropogoneae could be explained by unequal levels of purifying selection among lineages. consistent with this interpretation, the rate of nonsynonymous substitution differed along several lineages, while the synonymous substitution rate did not differ significantly. finally, using tb1, we examined phylogenetic relationships within the andropogoneae. the phylogeny suggests that the tribe underwent a rapid radiation during its early history and that the monoecious andropogoneae are polyphyletic.
immune and acute phase response in pigs experimentally infected with h1n2 swine influenza virus. in the present study, acute phase proteins (app) responses in pigs after infection with toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida (pm) were evaluated. twelve piglets from a herd free from toxigenic pm were used. six of them were infected intranasally with pm. crp, hp, saa and pig-map concentrations were measured using commercial elisa tests. crp and hp were significantly induced from 2 days post inoculation (dpi). the concentration of hp in inoculated pigs remained elevated until the end of the study. the concentrations of saa and pig-map increased significantly from 3 dpi, and remained elevated to 5 or 7 dpi, respectively. strong correlations were observed between concentration of hp or saa and changes in the lungs. no correlations were found between levels of app in serum and changes observed in the turbinates. on the basis of our investigation, we cannot state that evaluation of app concentrations in serum may provide useful information about severity of atrophic rhinitis. however, the concentration of all investigated app increased after inoculation. thus, app-measurements may reveal ongoing infection. monitoring of app concentrations in the pig herds may help to pinpoint infected animals even before clinical signs are present. if found, these "app-high" animals may be chosen next for pathogen-specific diagnostics. early diagnosis and therapy may prevent the infection from spreading in the herd. moreover, monitoring of app concentrations in serum may be useful for selecting clinically healthy pigs before integration into an uninfected herd. future studies should focus on the possibility of distinguishing infected and non-infected pigs under field conditions.
the effects of different exercise programmes on female body composition objective:the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 12-month moderate-to-vigorous exercise program combining aerobic and muscle strength training on body composition among sedentary, postmenopausal women. methods:a randomized controlled trial was conducted. a total of 189 sedentary postmenopausal women (age 50-69 y, body mass index 22-40 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to an exercise (n = 96) or a control group (n = 93). study parameters measured at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months were as follows: body weight and body height (body mass index), waist and hip circumference (body fat distribution), and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (total body fat and lean mass). differences in changes in study parameters between exercise and control group were examined with generalized estimating equations analysis. results:the exercise program did not result in significant effects on weight, body mass index, and hip circumference. the exercise group experienced a statistically significant greater loss in total body fat, both absolute (−0.33 kg) (borderline) as in a percentage (−0.43%) compared with the control group. in addition, lean mass increased significantly (+0.31 kg), whereas waist circumference (−0.57 cm) decreased significantly compared with the control group. conclusions:we conclude that a 12-month exercise program combining aerobic and muscle strength training did not affect weight but positively influenced body composition of postmenopausal women. affecting body fat distribution and waist circumference may have important health implications because it is an independent risk factor in obese but also in nonobese people. therefore, this study gives further credence to efforts of public health and general practitioners aiming to increase physical activity levels of postmenopausal women.
the influence of secondhand smoke exposure on birth outcomes in jordan we analysed the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy on fetal growth parameters in 129 term newborns. children were classified into four depending on exposure on the basis of a questionnaire completed by the mother. the results confirmed that tobacco smoking reduced weight, length, cranial and thoracic perimeters at birth when exposure was due to either active or passive smoking. weight deficits of infants whose mothers smoked heavily (458 g) were higher than those whose mothers were exposed to passive smoking (192 g). we conclude that passive smoking is a very important variable and should be taken into account in any study of neonatal growth parameters.
spleen function and anxiety in chinese medicine: a western medicine perspective some types of mood disorders and drugs are suggested to affect peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors (pbr), but their mechanisms are unclear. the isolation of pure lymphocytes is requisite for the investigation of the function of pbr on lymphocytes, since platelets and monocytes also have many pbr. the objective of this study was to establish a method of binding assay for pbr using pure t lymphocytes. mononuclear cells and t lymphocytes were prepared by using a density gradient material and magnetic beads, respectively. the cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and a counting chamber. binding studies were performed using t lymphocytes from 10 normal volunteers. the t lymphocytes were incubated with [3h]pk11195, harvested on glass fiber filters, and counted with a plate scintillation counter. the binding data were analyzed by the scatchard method. with the magnetic bead technique, pure t cells were selected that contained only 1.5% monocytes and platelet/cell ratio of 1.4. the scatchard plot of the data indicated that only one type of specific binding site was involved in the binding. the dissociation constant (kd) was 3.8+/-1.3nm (mean+/-sd), and the bmax was 379+/-124 fmol//10(6) cells (mean+/-sd). the density gradient- magnetic beads technique can be used as an appropriate method of preparation of t cells for pbr binding assay.
relationship between cd4 count and quality of life over time among hiv patients in uganda: a cohort study this study compared the level of cd4 count, viral load and health-related quality of life (hrqol) between treatment-naïve aids patients and a cohort of people living with hiv who have been on treatment for 12 months. this study is based on a secondary data analysis of the records of 642 people with hiv consisting of 311 treatment-naïve aids patients and 331 people with hiv who have been on treatment for 12 months. the study findings are mostly presented in tables and analysed using the t-test to compare hrqol scores, cd4 count and viral load in the two groups. the study generally noted poor financial capacity and low activity tolerance among the participants. significant changes were noted in all the domains of hrqol compared between the treatment-naïve patients and the 12 months treatment cohort. in the same manner, the median cd4 cell count and viral load differed significantly between both groups. the treatment-naïve and the 12 months treatment cohorts consistently reported much lower quality of life scores in the level of dependence domain which includes the measures of mobility, activity of daily living, dependence on medication and work capacity. there were little or no associations between the biomedical markers (cd4 count and viral load) and hrqol indicators. however, the quality of life tended to increase with increase in the cd4 cell count. the poor to no association between the biomedical markers and hrqol indicators show that these cannot be direct proxies of each other and that the cd4 cell count and viral load alone may be inadequate eligibility criteria for social support.
innate differences in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the regions within the extended amygdala between alcohol preferring and nonpreferring rats. abstract: the neuropeptide‐inducing activity of neurotrophic factors was tested in cultured cerebral cortical neurons. brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) specifically increased contents of the neuropeptides somatostatin (som) and neuropeptide y (npy), but its effect on contents of cholecystokinin octapeptide and gaba was much less significant. the maximal induction of npy content (15‐fold increase) was achieved by 20 ng/ml of bdnf. these changes were also reproduced at the mrna level. in contrast, neurotrophin‐3 was much less potent at increasing npy and som contents, and nerve growth factor had no effect on them. the expression of mrna for npy and som was fully dependent on the presence of bdnf in culture but irrelevant to the survival‐promoting activity of bdnf, which has been reported previously. most of the npy immunoreactivity induced by bdnf was colocalized with glutamate decarboxylase immunoreactivity in cultured cortical neurons. these results suggest that bdnf regulates the peptidergic expression of gabaergic neurons in the cerebral cortex.
motor learning affects visual movement perception neuroimaging studies have recently provided support for the existence of a human equivalent of the "mirror-neuron" system as first described in monkeys [1], involved in both the execution of movements as well as the observation and imitation of actions performed by others (e.g., [2-6]). a widely held conception concerning this system is that the understanding of observed actions is mediated by a covert simulation process [7]. in the present fmri experiment, this simulation process was probed by asking subjects to discriminate between visually presented trajectories that either did or did not match previously performed but unseen continuous movement sequences. a specific network of learning-related premotor and parietal areas was found to be reactivated when participants were confronted with their movements' visual counterpart. moreover, the strength of these reactivations was dependent on the observers' experience with executing the corresponding movement sequence. these findings provide further support for the emerging view that embodied simulations during action observation engage widespread activations in cortical motor regions beyond the classically defined mirror-neuron system. furthermore, the obtained results extend previous work by showing experience-dependent perceptual modulations at the neural systems level based on nonvisual motor learning.
a counterbalanced cross-over study of the effects of visual, auditory and no feedback on performance measures in a simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation background cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) guidelines recommend complete release between chest compressions (cc). no study has evaluated prevalence of leaning and the effect of real-time automated audiovisual feedback during in-hospital pediatric cpr.   objectives we hypothesize that leaning during in-hospital pediatric cpr will be common, and that real-time automated feedback will be associated with reduced leaning prevalence and force.   methods a feedback-capable monitor/defibrillator equipped with force transducer and accelerometer recorded cc leaning force and depth during in-hospital cardiac arrests (>/=8 years) at a children's hospital. automated feedback was enabled at the resuscitation leader's discretion, and audiovisual prompts were given when leaning force exceeded 2.5 kg. leaning force and depth cc with no feedback (nof) vs. with feedback (f) were compared.   results 20 pediatric (mean age 14.7+/-3.8 years) pulse less arrests generated 37,396 evaluable cc. median leaning force was 1.6 kg [0.9-2.7 kg] and leaning depth 2.9 (1.6-4.7)mm. leaning force was greater with nof (2.5 kg, [1.6-3.5 kg]; n=1921) vs. f (1.6 kg [0.9-2.6 kg]; n=35,164, p<0.001). leaning>2.5 kg (adult feedback threshold) occurred in 50% (n=969) of cc with nof and 27% (n=9367) cc with f (p<0.001). cc without leaning, defined as a leaning force of<0.5 kg, occurred in 2.2% (n=43) cc with nof vs. 10.5% (n=3681) cc with f (p<0.001).   conclusions leaning (residual force>2.5 kg) was common during pediatric cpr. the prevalence and force of leaning were reduced with automated audiovisual feedback. further study is necessary to determine the effect of the specific leaning threshold on cpr hemodynamics.
white matter structure in the right planum temporale region correlates with visual motion detection thresholds in deaf people previous brain imaging studies have demonstrated responses to tactile and auditory stimuli in visual cortex of blind subjects, suggesting that removal of one sensory modality leads to neural reorganization of the remaining modalities. to investigate whether similar 'cross-modal' plasticity occurs in human auditory cortex, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to measure visually evoked activity in auditory areas of both early-deafened and hearing individuals. here we find that deaf subjects exhibit activation in a region of the right auditory cortex, corresponding to brodmann's areas 42 and 22, as well as in area 41 (primary auditory cortex), demonstrating that early deafness results in the processing of visual stimuli in auditory cortex.
implication of fragile sites and intrachromosomal telomeric ( ttaggg ) n sequences in primate chromosome evolution abstract. the intrachromosomal location of the telomeric sequence in the crab-eating macaque, macaca fascicularis (f. cercopithecidae, catarrhini) has been analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation with a long synthetic (ttaggg)n probe. a total of 237 metaphases was analysed. as expected, all telomeres hybridised with the probe and 90 intrachromosomal loci with different hybridisation frequencies were also detected. the chromosomal location of interstitial telomeric sequences in m. fascicularis and in homo sapiens was then compared, 37 sites (41.11%) being found to be conserved. some of these sequences can be derived from rearrangements, such as inversions (mfa13q23) or fusions (mfa2p13 and mfa13p12), that have taken place during karyotype evolution.
restoration of immune surface molecules in kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infected cells by lenalidomide and pomalidomide. tnf-alpha mediates both protective and detrimental manifestations of the host immune response. our previous work has shown thalidomide to be a relatively selective inhibitor of tnf-alpha production in vivo and in vitro. additionally, we have recently reported that thalidomide exerts a costimulatory effect on t cell responses. to develop thalidomide analogues with increased anti-tnf-alpha activity and reduced or absent toxicities, novel tnf-alpha inhibitors were designed and synthesized. when a selected group of these compounds was examined for their immunomodulatory activities, different patterns of cytokine modulation were revealed. the tested compounds segregated into two distinct classes: one class of compounds, shown to be potent phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, inhibited tnf-alpha production, increased il-10 production by lps-induced pbmc, and had little effect on t cell activation; the other class of compounds, similar to thalidomide, were not phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors and markedly stimulated t cell proliferation and il-2 and ifn-gamma production. these compounds inhibited tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-6 and greatly increased il-10 production by lps-induced pbmc. similar to thalidomide, the effect of these agents on il-12 production was dichotomous; il-12 was inhibited when pbmc were stimulated with lps but increased when cells were stimulated by cross-linking the tcr. the latter effect was associated with increased t cell cd40 ligand expression. the distinct immunomodulatory activities of these classes of thalidomide analogues may potentially allow them to be used in the clinic for the treatment of different immunopathological disorders.
managing legume cover crops and their residues to enhance productivity of degraded soils in the humid tropics: a case study in bukoba district, tanzania the review summarizes the current status of the utilization of n2-fixing organisms as biofertilizer in rice cultivation. heterotrophic bacteria, free-living cyanobacteria,azolla, and legume green manures are considered with regard to their potential for increasing yield, their current use and the prospects for their use with regard to the identified limiting factors.biological n2 fixation has been the most effective system for sustaining production in low-input traditional rice cultivation. on the other hand, the utilisation of n2-fixing organisms in intensified rice production encounters serious limitations. the utilization of free-living bacteria and cyanobacteria is refrained by their modest potential and the non establishment of inoculated strains.azolla and legumes used as green manures have a high potential as n source, but their utilization is severely limited by socio-economic factors.
rapid increase in fibroblast growth factor 21 in protein malnutrition and its impact on growth and lipid metabolism objective—fibroblast growth factor 21 (fgf21) has emerged as an important metabolic regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. the aims of the current study are to evaluate the role of fgf21 in energy metabolism and to provide mechanistic insights into its glucose and lipid-lowering effects in a high-fat diet–induced obesity (dio) model. research design and methods—dio or normal lean mice were treated with vehicle or recombinant murine fgf21. metabolic parameters including body weight, glucose, and lipid levels were monitored, and hepatic gene expression was analyzed. energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity were assessed using indirect calorimetry and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp techniques. results—fgf21 dose dependently reduced body weight and whole-body fat mass in dio mice due to marked increases in total energy expenditure and physical activity levels. fgf21 also reduced blood glucose, insulin, and lipid levels and reversed hepatic steatosis. the profound reduction of hepatic triglyceride levels was associated with fgf21 inhibition of nuclear sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and the expression of a wide array of genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. fgf21 also dramatically improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in both lean and dio mice independently of reduction in body weight and adiposity. conclusions—fgf21 corrects multiple metabolic disorders in dio mice and has the potential to become a powerful therapeutic to treat hepatic steatosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.
preferential binding to dopamine d3 over d2 receptors by cariprazine in patients with schizophrenia using pet with the d3/d2 receptor ligand [11c]-(+)-phno we investigated the in vivo effects of orally administered cariprazine (rgh-188; trans-n-{4-[2-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl]-cyclohexyl}-n',n'-dimethyl-urea), a d(3)/d(2) dopamine receptor partial agonist with ∼10-fold preference for the d(3) receptor. oral bioavailability of cariprazine at a dose of 1mg/kg in rats was 52% with peak plasma concentrations of 91ng/ml. cariprazine 10mg/kg had good blood-brain barrier penetration, with a brain/plasma auc ratio of 7.6:1. in rats, cariprazine showed dose-dependent in vivo displacement of [(3)h](+)-phno, a dopamine d(3) receptor-preferring radiotracer, in the d(3) receptor-rich region of cerebellar lobules 9 and 10. its potent inhibition of apomorphine-induced climbing in mice (ed(50)=0.27mg/kg) was sustained for 8h. cariprazine blocked amphetamine-induced hyperactivity (ed(50)=0.12mg/kg) and conditioned avoidance response (car) (ed(50)=0.84mg/kg) in rats, and inhibited the locomotor-stimulating effects of the noncompetitive nmda antagonists mk-801 (ed(50)=0.049mg/kg) and phencyclidine (ed(50)=0.09mg/kg) in mice and rats, respectively. it reduced novelty-induced motor activity of mice (ed(50)=0.11mg/kg) and rats (ed(50)=0.18mg/kg) with a maximal effect of 70% in both species. cariprazine produced no catalepsy in rats at up to 100-fold dose of its car inhibitory ed(50) value. cariprazine 0.02-0.08mg/kg significantly improved the learning performance of scopolamine-treated rats in a water-labyrinth learning paradigm. though risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole showed antipsychotic-like activity in many of these assays, they were less active against phencyclidine and more cataleptogenic than cariprazine, and had no significant effect in the learning task. the distinct in vivo profile of cariprazine may be due to its higher affinity and in vivo binding to d(3) receptors versus currently marketed typical and atypical antipsychotics.
epidemiologic determinants affecting cigarette smoking cessation: a retrospective study in a national health system (ssn) treatment service in rome (italy) community-based fresh start courses have been running at local community centres throughout victoria since february 1983. this paper describes the key features of this program and identifies the factors which relate to smoking cessation. data were collected from 3298 participants who attended a program between february 1983 and june 1988. all participants were asked to complete three short questionnaires: on arrival at the course, at the conclusion of the course and a year after finishing the course. although most participants had made previous unsuccessful quit attempts and perceived quitting to be difficult, attendance at the course had a major impact on their reported smoking. at the conclusion of the course at least 51% of participants had quit smoking and the remaining participants had reduced their smoking by an average of 50%. at the 1 year follow-up, at least 23% of participants were non-smokers and the remaining participants had reduced their smoking by an average of 21%. successful quitting at the end of the course and at the 12 month follow-up was positively related to the number of sessions attended and the perceived likelihood of quitting, and negatively related to initial cigarette consumption.
application of rapd markers in the characterisation of chrysanthemum varieties and the assessment of somaclonal variation several techniques of dna analysis were applied to identify chrysanthemum cultivars. unrelated cultivars could be distinguished by using rapds (random amplified polymorphic dnas), inter-ssr (simple sequence repeat) pcr (polymerase chain reaction), hybridization-based dna fingerprinting, as well as rflps (restriction fragment length polymorphisms). cultivars with different flower colours and belonging to one family, i.e. vegetatively derived from 1 cultivar, appeared to have the same dna fragment patterns, whichever technique was applied. the absence of polymorphisms between different accessions of the same cultivar indicated a high stability of the observed patterns.
effect of balance training on neuromuscular function at rest and during isometric maximum voluntary contraction balancing exercises on instable bases (sensorimotor training [smt]) are often used in the rehabilitation process of an injured athlete to restore joint function. recently it was shown that smt was able to enhance rate of force development (rfd) in a maximal voluntary muscle contraction. the purpose of this study was to compare adaptations on strength capacity following ballistic strength training (bst) with those following an smt during a training period of 1 microcycle (4 weeks). maximum voluntary isometric strength (mvc), maximum rfd (rfdmax) and the corresponding neural activation of m. soleus (sol), m. gastrocnemius (gas), and m. tibialis anterior (tib) were measured during plantar flexion in 33 healthy subjects. the subjects were randomly assigned to a smt, bst, or control group. rfdmax increased significantly stronger following bst (48 ± 16%; p < 0.01) compared to smt (14 ± 5%; p < 0.05), whereas mvc remained unchanged in both groups. median frequencies of the electromyographic power spectrum during the first 200 ms of contraction for gas increased following both bst (45 ± 21%; p < 0.05) and smt (45 ± 22%; p < 0.05), but median frequencies for sol increased only after smt (13 ± 4%; p < 0.05). additionally, mean amplitude voltage increased following bst for sol (38 ± 12%; p < 0.01) and for gas (73 ± 23%; p < 0.01) during the first 100 ms, whereas it remained unchanged after smt. it is concluded that bst and smt may induce different neural adaptations that specifically affect recruitment and discharge rates of motor units at the beginning of voluntary contraction. specific neural adaptations indicate that smt might be used complementarily to bst, especially in sports that require contractile explosive properties in situations with high postural demands, e.g., during jumps in ball sports.
venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in meningioma surgery: a population-based comparative effectiveness study of routine mechanical prophylaxis with or without preoperative low-molecular-weight heparin. individuals with brain tumors have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (vte). within this population, patients with meningiomas have been reported to have the highest incidence, exceeding rates associated with gliomas and brain metastases. however, earlier studies did not employ vte prophylaxis, and vte were detected with radionuclide scans, the reliability of which has since been questioned. therefore, we conducted a retrospective review of postoperative meningioma patients receiving contemporary vte prophylaxis and diagnostic methods to define the current incidence of and risk factors for symptomatic vte in this population.
prevalence of anaplasma phagocytophilum in fallow deer (dama dama) and feeding ticks from an italy preserve. seasons. roe deer were sampled during the summer and the fall in 10 districts (czarnkow, krzykosy, oborniki, margonin, miedzychod, murowana-goslina, poniec, sierakow, trzcian- ka, wielen ´ ), whereas samples from red and fallow deer were obtained only during the fall in nine (listed above with the exception of krykosy) and two districts (margonin, murowa- na-goslina), respectively. in total, 238 partially or fully engorged female and 63 non-engorged male i. ricinus ticks were obtained from 51 animals (20 fallow deer, 18 roe deer and 13 red deer). total dna was extracted from blood and i. ricinus ticks using the genomic mini ax blood (a&a biotechnology, gdynia, poland) and sherlock ax kit (a&a biotechnology), respec- tively. blood and tick samples were analysed for the presence of a. phagocytophilum dna by pcr using three different primer sets: ehr521-ehr747, la6-la1 and hge396-hge921, based on the sequences of the 16s rdna, anka and hge-44 genes, respectively (4,5). pcr products were considered positive when a. phagocytophilum dna was detected by at least two primer sets. additionally, selected pcr-positive samples tested with the primers la6-la1 specific for a 444-bp region of the anka gene were sequenced with the abi prism 3100 genetic analyser (applied biosystem 850, foster city, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer's protocol. sequences were edited and compared with gene sequences deposited in the genbank database using the ncbi blast program (u.s. national institute of health, bethesda, maryland).
phpt4 is a mycorrhizal-phosphate transporter suppressed by lysophosphatidylcholine in petunia roots the arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) symbiosis represents the most widely distributed mutualistic root symbiosis. we report that root extracts of mycorrhizal plants contain a lipophilic signal capable of inducing the phosphate transporter genes stpt3 and stpt4 of potato (solanum tuberosum l.), genes that are specifically induced in roots colonized by am fungi. the same signal caused rapid extracellular alkalinization in suspension-cultured tomato (solanum lycopersicum l.) cells and induction of the mycorrhiza-specific phosphate transporter gene lept4 in these cells. the active principle was characterized as the lysolipid lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lpc) via a combination of gene expression studies, alkalinization assays in cell cultures, and chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses. our results highlight the importance of lysophospholipids as signals in plants and in particular in the am symbiosis.
astrocytes shed large membrane vesicles that contain mitochondria, lipid droplets and atp we have earlier shown that microglia, the immune cells of the cns, release microparticles from cell plasma membrane after atp stimulation. these vesicles contain and release il‐1β, a crucial cytokine in cns inflammatory events. in this study, we show that microparticles are also released by astrocytes and we get insights into the mechanism of their shedding. we show that, on activation of the atp receptor p2x7, microparticle shedding is associated with rapid activation of acid sphingomyelinase, which moves to plasma membrane outer leaflet. atp‐induced shedding and il‐1β release are markedly reduced by the inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase, and completely blocked in glial cultures from acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice. we also show that p38 mapk cascade is relevant for the whole process, as specific kinase inhibitors strongly reduce acid sphingomyelinase activation, microparticle shedding and il‐1β release. our results represent the first demonstration that activation of acid sphingomyelinase is necessary and sufficient for microparticle release from glial cells and define key molecular effectors of microparticle formation and il‐1β release, thus, opening new strategies for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.
disease resistance in the drywood termite, incisitermes schwarzi: does nesting ecology affect immunocompetence? abstract the benefit of sociality in relation to disease susceptibility was studied in the dampwood termite zootermopsis angusticollis. although contact with high concentrations of fungal conidia is lethal, the survivorship of nymphs exposed to spore suspensions ranging from 6 × 106 to 2 × 108 spores/ml of the fungus metarhizium anisopliae increased with group size. the survivorship (measured as lt50) of isolated individuals ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 days, but infected nymphs living in groups of 10 and 25 individuals survived significantly longer (5.6–8.3 and 5.6–9.1 days, respectively). in most cases, there were no significant differences in the survival distributions of the 10- and 25-termite groups. when nymphs were infected with concentrations of 7 × 101–7 × 104 spores/ml and allowed to interact with healthy nestmates, fungal infections were not contracted by the unexposed termites. moreover, infected termites benefitted from social contact with unexposed nestmates: their survival rates were significantly higher than those of infected termites living with similarly infected nestmates. allogrooming, which increased in frequency during and after exposure to conidia, appeared to remove potentially infectious spores from the cuticle, thus increasing termite survivorship. these results suggest that allogrooming plays a crucial role in the control of disease and its death hazard in termites. the infection-reducing advantage of group living may have been significant in the evolution of social behavior in the isoptera.
cytomegalovirus-associated severe fatal necrotizing pancreatitis in a patient with interstitial pneumonitis treated with steroids. an autopsy case. diffuse pulmonary small nodules and pyrexia suddenly developed in a 27-year-old woman during immunosuppressive treatment for viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. miliary tuberculosis was suspected, however, bone marrow biopsy did not support the diagnosis. lung biopsy revealed interstitial pneumonitis admixed with characteristic inclusion-bearing cells, and cytomegalovirus (cmv) dna was demonstrated in polymerase chain reaction using bronchoalveolar lavage cells, establishing the diagnosis of cmv pneumonitis. no other opportunistic pathogens were identified, and the pneumonitis was subsided due to administration of gancyclovir. the present case illustrates cmv pneumonitis as a differential diagnosis for small nodular opacities which develop in immunocompromised patients.
bmi1 is expressed in canine osteosarcoma and contributes to cell growth and chemotherapy resistance there is increasing evidence that a variety of cancers arise from transformation of normal stem cells to cancer stem cells (cscs). cscs are thought to sustain cancer progression, invasion, metastasis, and recurrence after therapy. reports suggest that cscs are highly resistant to conventional therapy. emerging evidences show that the chemoresistance of cscs are in part due to the activation of b cell‐specific moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (bmi1), a stem cell factor, and a polycomb group family member. bmi1 is reported to regulate the proliferation activity of normal, stem, and progenitor cells. bmi1 plays a role in cell cycle, cell immortalization, and senescence. numerous studies demonstrate that bmi1, which is upregulated in a variety of cancers, has a positive correlation with clinical grade/stage and poor prognosis. although evidences are in support of the role of bmi1 as a factor in chemoresistance displayed by cscs, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. in this review, we provide summary of evidences (with mechanism of action established) suggesting the significance of bmi1 in chemoresistance and recurrence of cscs. stem cells 2012;30:372–378
diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis by dynamic contrast imaging: the importance of tumor cell differentiation background contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ce-us), contrast ct scan and gadolinium dynamic mri are recommended for the characterisation of liver nodules detected during surveillance of patients with cirrhosis with us. aim to assess the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and economic impact of all possible sequential combinations of contrast imaging techniques in patients with cirrhosis with 1–2 cm liver nodules undergoing us surveillance. patients/methods 64 patients with 67 de novo liver nodules (55 with a size of 1–2 cm) were consecutively examined by ce-us, ct, mri, and a fine-needle biopsy (fnb) as diagnostic standard. undiagnosed nodules were re-biopsied; non-malignant nodules underwent enhanced imaging follow-up. the typical radiological feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) was arterial phase hypervascularisation followed by portal/venous phase washout. results hcc was diagnosed in 44 (66%) nodules (2, <1 cm; 34, 1–2 cm; 8, >2 cm). the sensitivity of ce-us, ct and mri for 1–2 cm hcc was 26, 44 and 44%, with 100% specificity, the typical vascular pattern of hcc being identified in 22 (65%) by a single technique versus 12 (35%) by at least two techniques carried out at the same time point (p=0.028). compared with the cheapest dual examination (ce-us+ct), the cheapest single technique of stepwise imaging diagnosis of hcc was equally expensive (€26 440 vs €28 667), but led to a 23% reduction of fnb procedures (p=0.031). conclusions in patients with cirrhosis with a 1–2 cm nodule detected during surveillance, a single imaging technique showing a typical contrast pattern confidently permits the diagnosis of hcc, thereby reducing the need for fnb examinations.
hexapeptides that inhibit processing of branched dna structures induce a dynamic ensemble of holliday junction conformations* holliday junctions (hj) are the central intermediates in both homologous recombination and site-specific recombination performed by tyrosine recombinases such as the bacteriophage lambda integrase (int) protein. previously, our lab identified peptide inhibitors of int-mediated recombination that prevent the resolution of hj intermediates. we now show that two of these inhibitors bind hj dna in the square-planar conformation even in the absence of int protein. the peptides prevent unwinding of branched dna substrates by the recg helicase of escherichia coli and interfere with the resolution of hj substrates by the ruvabc complex. our results suggest that these peptides target all proteins that process hj in the square-planar conformation. these inhibitors should be extremely useful for dissecting homologous recombination and recombination-dependent repair in vitro and in vivo.
mrna and microrna expression profiles in circulating tumor cells and primary tumors of metastatic breast cancer patients introductionwhen breast cancer patients develop distant metastases, the choice of systemic treatment is usually based on tissue characteristics of the primary tumor as determined by immunohistochemistry (ihc) and/or molecular analysis. several previous studies have shown that the immunophenotype of distant breast cancer metastases may be different from that of the primary tumor (receptor conversion), leading to inappropriate choice of systemic treatment. the studies published so far are however small and/or methodologically suboptimal. therefore, definite conclusions that may change clinical practice could not yet be drawn. we therefore aimed to study receptor conversion for estrogen receptor alpha (erα), progesterone receptor (pr), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) in a large group of distant (non-bone) breast cancer metastases by re-staining all primary tumors and metastases with current optimal immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods on full sections.methodsa total of 233 distant breast cancer metastases from different sites (76 skin, 63 liver, 43 lung, 44 brain and 7 gastro-intestinal) were ihc stained for erα, pr and her2, and expression was compared to that of the primary tumor. her2 in situ hybridization (ish) was done in cases of ihc conversion or when primary tumors or metastases showed an ihc 2+ result.resultsusing a 10% threshold, receptor conversion by ihc for erα, pr occurred in 10.3%, 30.0% of patients, respectively. in 10.7% of patients, conversion from er+ or pr+ to er-/pr- and in 3.4% from er-/pr- to er+ or pr+ was found. using a 1% threshold, erα and pr conversion rates were 15.1% and 32.6%. in 12.4% of patients conversion from er+ or pr+ to er-/pr-, and 8.2% from er-/pr- to er+ or pr+ occurred. her2 conversion occurred in 5.2%. of the 12 cases that showed her2 conversion by ihc, 5 showed also conversion by ish. one further case showed conversion by ish, but not by ihc. conversion was mainly from positive in the primary tumor to negative in the metastases for erα and pr, while her2 conversion occurred equally both ways. pr conversion occurred significantly more often in liver, brain and gastro-intestinal metastases.conclusionsreceptor conversion by immunohistochemistry in (non-bone) distant breast cancer metastases does occur, is relatively uncommon for erα and her2, and is more frequent for pr, especially in brain, liver and gastro-intestinal metastases.
copy number variation screen identifies a rare de novo deletion at chromosome 15q13.1-13.3 in a child with language impairment copy number variation has emerged as an important type of genetic risk factor for developmental disorders, including the neurodevelopmental disorders schizophrenia, autism and mental retardation. the highly pleiotropic effects observed for specific copy number variants (cnvs) challenge current classification of these disorders, but also provide opportunities to understand their origins and the relationships between them.
prevalence and severity of categorical and dimensional personality disorders in adolescents with eating disorders. objective to study the development of personality disorders, especially those involving obsessions, compulsions, and social interaction problems, in a representative group of anorexia nervosa (an) cases.   method the prevalence of personality disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism spectrum disorders at mean age 24 years (10 years after reported onset) was examined in 51 adolescent-onset an cases recruited after community screening and 51 comparison cases matched for age, sex, and school. all 102 cases had originally been examined at age 16 years and followed up at 21 years. at 24 years, structured and validated psychiatric diagnostic interviews were performed by a psychiatrist who was blind to original diagnosis. the majority of an cases (94%) were weight-restored.   results personality disorders, particularly cluster c, and autism spectrum disorders were overrepresented in the an group. obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and/or autism spectrum disorder was diagnosed in a subgroup of an cases in all 3 studies. this subgroup had a very poor psychosocial outcome.   conclusions persistent problems with obsessions, compulsions, and social interaction characterized a substantial minority of weight-restored an cases at 10-year follow-up. these problems appear to be constitutional rather than a result of an, and they may warrant a different treatment approach.
comparison of ultrasound, pathologic and prognostic characteristics of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer according to fine-needle aspiration cytology. background follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (fv-ptc) has been increasingly diagnosed in recent years. however, little is known about its clinical behavior. the purpose of this study was to determine the disease characteristics of fv-ptc, and to compare it with classical papillary thyroid carcinoma (c-ptc) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (ftc).   methods all cases of c-ptc, fv-ptc, and ftc larger than 1 cm in the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (seer) cancer database from 1988 to 2007 were identified. tumor behavior and patient survival were compared among these three groups. different risk factors for disease-specific mortality in each group were evaluated by multivariate analysis.   results more than 36,000 surgical cases were identified, including 21,796 c-ptcs, 10,740 fv-ptcs, and 3958 ftcs. extrathyroidal extension and lymph-node metastases were more common in fv-ptc than in ftc, but significantly less common than in c-ptc (p<0.0001). distant metastasis rates were present in 2% of patients with fv-ptc, in 1% with c-ptc, and in 4% with ftc (p<0.0001). the 10-year disease-specific survival for patients with fv-ptc was 98%, similar to c-ptc (97%) but better than ftc (94%, p<0.0001). being over the age of 45 years remained a strong risk factor for disease-specific mortality in both fv-ptc and c-ptc, while the presence of extrathyroidal extension and distant metastases were stronger predictors of disease-specific mortality in fv-ptc than in c-ptc.   conclusions fv-ptc is a common variant of ptc. its clinical behavior is unique and represents an intermediate entity with clinical features that are between c-ptc and ftc. interestingly, despite the variations in clinical behavior, the long-term outcome of these patients remains excellent and similar to c-ptc.
context-outcome associations underlie context-switch effects after partial reinforcement in human predictive learning contextual conditioning during relative validity training was explored in 3 experiments that used an appetitive pavlovian conditioning preparation with rats. magazine entries were the conditioned response. in experiment 1, true-discrimination (td: ax+, bx-) training generated weaker conditioning of x than did pseudodiscrimination (pd: ax+/-, bx+/-) training. the context showed a similar relative validity effect. also, both pd training and simple partial reinforcement (x+/-) reduced contextual conditioning more than did unsignaled food, a demonstration of relative validity using partial reinforcement. experiments 2 and 3 used within-subject and between-subjects designs, respectively, and showed that relative validity was determined by the summation of differences in conditioning to both the common element (x) and the context. our results are consistent with an attentional model or with a computational comparator model but not with the rescorla-wagner (r. a. rescorla & a. r. wagner, 1972) model.
spatial and age-dependent tree-ring growth responses of larix gmelinii to climate in northeastern china qilian juniper (sabina przewalskii kom.) is one of the dominant tree species on qinghai-tibetan plateau and has been used in dendroclimatological studies. here we designed a test to examine whether or not the climate–growth responses in tree rings of qilian juniper vary with the change in tree's age. a total number of 135 increment cores were sampled from qilian juniper trees at five sites, in which 112 cores were selected and grouped into five 100-year age classes for analysis of age-dependent climate–growth relationships. chronology statistics, response functions and anova f-test were used to test the consistency of five age-class mean chronologies (agcs). the results showed that mean sensitivity (ms) and standard deviation (sd) did not change significantly with age. response function analysis indicated that (a) climate accounts for a high amount of variance in tree-ring widths; (b) tree-ring growth has significant positive correlation with mean monthly air temperature of previous october and november, and with total monthly precipitation of current january and june, while has significant negative correlation with mean monthly air temperature of current may; and (c) agc-2, agc-3 and agc-4 have stronger response to climate change than agc-1 and agc-5. the anova f-test showed that generally there are significant differences between the first age class and other four age classes, but among the four classes in which trees are older than 200 years, the differences are usually insignificant. overall the long-lived qilian juniper is still an ideal tree species for dendroclimatic reconstruction.
children's disruptiveness, peer rejection, friends' deviancy, and delinquent behaviors: a process-oriented approach. this study assessed the hypothesis that popularity in adolescence takes on a twofold role, marking high levels of concurrent adaptation but predicting increases over time in both positive and negative behaviors sanctioned by peer norms. multimethod, longitudinal data, on a diverse community sample of 185 adolescents (13 to 14 years), addressed these hypotheses. as hypothesized, popular adolescents displayed higher concurrent levels of ego development, secure attachment, and more adaptive interactions with mothers and best friends. longitudinal analyses supported a popularity-socialization hypothesis, however, in which popular adolescents were more likely to increase behaviors that receive approval in the peer group (e.g., minor levels of drug use and delinquency) and decrease behaviors unlikely to be well received by peers (e.g., hostile behavior with peers).
expression levels and clinical significance of mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in this study, we report for the first time reduced expression of the let-7 microrna in human lung cancers. interestingly, 143 lung cancer cases that had undergone potentially curative resection could be classified into two major groups according to let-7 expression in unsupervised hierarchical analysis, showing significantly shorter survival after potentially curative resection in cases with reduced let-7 expression (p = 0.0003). multivariate cox regression analysis showed this prognostic impact to be independent of disease stage (hazard ratio = 2.17; p = 0.009). in addition, overexpression of let-7 in a549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line inhibited lung cancer cell growth in vitro. this study represents the first report of reduced expression of let-7 and the potential clinical and biological effects of such a microrna alteration.
rapid and weight-independent improvement of glucose tolerance induced by a peptide designed to elicit apoptosis in adipose tissue endothelium obesity alters adipose tissue metabolic and endocrine function and leads to an increased release of fatty acids, hormones, and proinflammatory molecules that contribute to obesity associated complications. to further characterize the changes that occur in adipose tissue with increasing adiposity, we profiled transcript expression in perigonadal adipose tissue from groups of mice in which adiposity varied due to sex, diet, and the obesity-related mutations agouti (ay) and obese (lepob). we found that the expression of 1,304 transcripts correlated significantly with body mass. of the 100 most significantly correlated genes, 30% encoded proteins that are characteristic of macrophages and are positively correlated with body mass. immunohistochemical analysis of perigonadal, perirenal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous adipose tissue revealed that the percentage of cells expressing the macrophage marker f4/80 (f4/80+) was significantly and positively correlated with both adipocyte size and body mass. similar relationships were found in human subcutaneous adipose tissue stained for the macrophage antigen cd68. bone marrow transplant studies and quantitation of macrophage number in adipose tissue from macrophage-deficient (csf1op/op) mice suggest that these f4/80+ cells are csf-1 dependent, bone marrow-derived adipose tissue macrophages. expression analysis of macrophage and nonmacrophage cell populations isolated from adipose tissue demonstrates that adipose tissue macrophages are responsible for almost all adipose tissue tnf-alpha expression and significant amounts of inos and il-6 expression. adipose tissue macrophage numbers increase in obesity and participate in inflammatory pathways that are activated in adipose tissues of obese individuals.
in vitro activity of compounds isolated from piper crassinervium against trypanosoma cruzi the in vitro antiproliferative effects of 4 neolignans purified from the ethyl-acetate extract from leaves of piper regnellii (miq.) c. dc. var. pallescens (c. dc.) yunck against trypanosoma cruzi were investigated. these isolated compounds were identified through spectral analyses of uv, ei-ms, 1h-, 13c-nmr, h-h cosy, gnoe, hetcor, and hmbc. the compounds eupomatenoid-5, eupomatenoid-6, and conocarpan showed considerable activity against epimastigote forms of t. cruzi, with 50% inhibition concentrations (ic50) of 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 microg/ml respectively. after methylation, these compounds showed a lessened inhibitory activity to the growth of the protozoan, suggesting that loss of the hydroxyl group from their molecules reduces the activity. the compound eupomatenoid-3 showed lower activity than the hexane fraction. eupomatenoid-5 was significantly more active than benznidazole, the antiparasitic drug of choice for treatment of chagas' disease. the crude extract, hexane fraction, and eupomatenoid-5 caused no lysis in sheep blood at concentrations which inhibit the growth of epimastigote forms. the compound eupomatenoid-5 showed low cytotoxic effects against vero cells. these results provide new perspectives on the development of novel drugs obtained from natural products with trypanocidal activity. however, the extracts and active compound isolated from p. regnellii var. pallescens should be further studied in animal models for in vivo efficacy.
association of interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms with breast cancer in a chinese population interleukin-10 (il-10) is an immunosuppressive cytokine which may facilitate development of cancer by supporting tumor escape from the immune response. a [tcata] haplotype formed by polymorphisms at positions −3575, −2763, −1082, −819 and −592 in the promoter of the il-10 gene is a strong determinant for il-10 expression. the presence of this haplotype can be determined by analysis of the −592c > a polymorphism. aim of the present study was to analyze the role of the il-10 [tcata] haplotype for breast cancer. we performed a case–control study including 500 female patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer and 500 female, age-matched, healthy control subjects from population-based screening studies. the −592c > a polymorphism was determined by a 5′-nuclease assay (taqman). frequency of the homozygous −592 aa genotype, indicating homozygosity for the [tcata] haplotype, was 4.2% among patients and 7.3% among controls (p=0.038; odds ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval 0.32–0.97). il-10 genotypes were not associated with tumor size, histological grading, estrogen or progesterone receptor status and age at diagnosis. therefore we conclude that the il-10 −592c > a promoter polymorphism may be associated with a reduced breast cancer risk.
a magnetic pulse does not affect homing pigeon navigation: a gps tracking experiment summary anatomical evidence and conditioning experiments have suggested that magnetoreceptors innervated by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve are located in the upper beak of homing pigeons. following these findings it has been proposed that the trigeminally-mediated magnetorececeptors are able to detect magnetic field intensity, which might be useful for a position finding mechanism for pigeons homing from unfamiliar locations. recent data have shown that, in inexperienced pigeons, section of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve does not impair navigational abilities. similarly, no impairment was observed if the trigeminal section was performed on young pigeons, before they have had the opportunity to learn a navigational map. by contrast, section of the olfactory nerve either in adult inexperienced pigeons or in young birds before map learning, disrupted their homing performance. nevertheless, because a magnetic map mechanism requires training flights for learning the magnetic gradient of the territory around the loft, the question remains as to whether the navigational performance of adult experienced pigeons can be affected by lack of magnetic information. to answer this question we extensively group-trained adult pigeons and then surgically deprived them of either olfactory or trigeminally mediated magnetic information, prior to testing their navigational abilities. the birds deprived of trigeminally mediated magnetic information displayed similar navigational abilities as intact control pigeons, whereas the olfactory-deprived pigeons were dramatically impaired in homing. our data show that even in trained adult pigeons, olfactory cues are needed for homing from unfamiliar locations and that the lack of magnetic information does not affect navigational abilities of experienced adult homing pigeons.
evidence for distinct alterations in the fgf axis in prostate cancer progression to an aggressive clinical phenotype fibroblast growth factors (fgf), and in particular fgf8, have been strongly implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. this study investigated the expression of sef, a key inhibitory regulator of fgf signalling, in prostate cancer. in a panel of cell lines, hsef was detected in both androgen-dependent and independent cells but was significantly reduced in highly metastatic derivative clones. hsef expression was not influenced by androgenic stimulation. forced downregulation of hsef by sirna increased fgf8b induced cell migration (p=0.02) and invasion (p=0.007). reduced hsef levels also enhanced fgf8b stimulated expression of mmp9 (p=0.005). mrna in situ hybridization revealed hsef expression in 80% (8/10) of benign biopsies but in only 69% (23/33) of gleason sum 4–7 and 35% (10/28) of gleason sum 8–10 cancer biopsies (p=0.004). quantitative pcr of microdissected glands confirmed this trend (p=0.001). hsef was expressed in 69% (27/39) of non-metastatic tumours but in only 18% (2/11) of metastatic tumours (p=0.004, n=50). hsef expression was next correlated with earlier data on fgf8b expression in a subgroup of cancers. in this cohort, 86% (19/22) of high-grade cancers expressed fgf8 but only 31% (7/22) expressed hsef. positive fgf8 expression but a loss of hsef was observed in 88% (7/8) of metastatic tumours. in contrast, metastasis was evident in only 10% (1/10) of tumours, which co-expressed both fgf8 and hsef (p<0.001). these results suggest evidence that hsef is downregulated in advanced prostate cancer and might facilitate an enhanced tumorigenic response to fgfs. further research into the role of hsef in cancer cell signalling and the mechanism of its downregulation may contribute to more effective targeting of growth factors in prostate cancer.
msea: modified symmetric encryption algorithm a new secret-key block cipher is proposed as a candidate for a new encryption standard. in the proposed cipher, the plaintext and the ciphertext are 64 bit blocks, while the secret key is 128 bit long. the cipher is based on the design concept of "mixing operations from different algebraic groups". the cipher structure was chosen to provide confusion and diffusion and to facilitate both hardware and software implementations.
tru-cut and fine needle aspiration biopsy diagnosis of lesions of the jaws aspiration biopsy of bone is a simple and relatively safe diagnostic tool that had a diagnostic accuracy of 72 per cent in thirty-one patients who had a primary bone tumor that was suspected of being malignant and of 83 per cent in twelve patients who had a suspected giant-cell tumor. however, twenty-six primary lesions of bone that were thought likely to be benign were not as easily and definitively diagnosed (an accuracy rate of 23 per cent), and for these lesions, multiple needle-aspiration samples or open biopsy provides greater diagnostic accuracy.
immunohistochemical expression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cystoprostatectomies with incidental and insignificant prostate cancer. further evidence for field effect in prostatic carcinogenesis. diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is usually not difficult in biopsy specimens. problems may occur in biopsy specimens, containing only a few suspicious lesions. recently, p504s has been tested as a new marker for prostatic carcinoma. when over-expressed in atypical glands without basal cells, it establishes the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma. we analysed the staining intensity of p504s in 208 biopsy specimens from prostates (1) with adenocarcinoma (n=132), (2) with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (hgpin) with adenocarcinoma (n=36), (3) with hgpin alone (n=40) and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to (n=54) or distant from adenocarcinoma (n=64). p504s expression was negative to weakly positive in biopsy specimens showing hgpin without carcinoma and weakly positive in radical prostatectomy specimens revealing hgpin distant from adenocarcinoma. in biopsy specimens with a combination of hgpin and adenocarcinoma and in radical prostatectomy specimens with hgpin adjacent to adenocarcinoma, p504s was strongly expressed. the same findings were made in radical prostatectomy specimens containing adenocarcinoma and hgpin adjacent to or distant from adenocarcinoma and in preoperative biopsies revealing adenocarcinoma and hgpin. these results suggest that moderate to strong p504s expression in hgpin of biopsy specimens is indicative of an associated adenocarcinoma and may be helpful in the choice of therapy.
fine resolution of human sperm nucleoproteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis. the dna in human sperm chromatin is packaged into nucleoprotamine (approximately 85%) and nucleohistone (approximately 15%). whether these two chromatin fractions are sequence-specific subsets of the spermatozoon genome is the question addressed in this report. sequence-specific packaging would suggest distinct structural and functional roles for the nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine in late spermatogenesis or early development or both. after removal of histones with 0.65m nacl, exposed dna was cleaved with bam hi restriction endonuclease and separated by centrifugation from insoluble nucleoprotamine. the dna sequence distribution of nucleohistone dna in the supernatant and nucleoprotamine dna in the pellet was compared by cloning size-selected single-copy sequences and by using the derived clones as probes of nucleohistone dna and nucleoprotamine dna. two clones derived from nucleohistone dna preferentially hybridized to nucleohistone dna, and two clones derived from nucleoprotamine dna preferentially hybridized to nucleoprotamine dna, which demonstrated the existence of sequence-specific nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine components within the human spermatozoon.
cyclin d 1 rs 9344 g > a polymorphism and gastric cancer risk : a meta-analysis objective. cyclin d1 (ccnd1) is a regulatory protein involved in the cell cycle of both normal and neoplastic cells. polymorphism of this gene at codon 242 in exon 4 (a870g) has an impact on the risk of several human cancers. the purpose of this study was to study the relation between the ccnd1 a870g gene polymorphism and the risk of non-cardiac gastric cancer in a chinese population. material and methods. the study population consisted of 159 patients with non-cardiac gastric cancer and 162 cancer-free controls. ccnd1 870a/g polymorphism was genotyped by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assay and sequencing. results. ccnd1 genotype distribution among the patients was significantly different from that among controls; aa (odds ratio (or)=0.348, 95% ci: 0.163–0.742) and ga (or=0.715, 95% ci: 0.506–1.012) genotypes were significantly lower in the gastric cancer patients than in the controls when subjects with the gg genotype served as the reference category. in other words, the risk of gastric cancer for subjects with the gg genotype was 2.8 times that of subjects with the aa genotype, and 1.4 times that of subjects with the ga genotype. furthermore, in the stratification analyses, the risk of gg genotype was more evident in subjects ≥60 years of age and those positive for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection. conclusions. the ccnd1870 gg genotype is associated with an increased risk for non-cardiac gastric cancer in patients in a high-risk area of china. larger studies with multiple polymorphisms are needed to verify this finding and the function of this polymorphism needs to be further investigated.
the effectiveness of electromyographic biofeedback as part of a meniscal repair rehabilitation programme. the patient with meniscal injury may present with pain, swelling, or mechanical symptoms and often requires surgical intervention for symptom resolution. treatment of such injuries relies on understanding the gross and microanatomic features of the meniscus that are important in maintaining meniscal function. the ability of the meniscus to participate in load bearing, shock absorption, joint lubrication, and joint stability depends on the maintenance of its structural integrity. the diagnosis of meniscal injury often can be made by clinical evaluation utilizing the history, physical examination, and plain radiographs. magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in confirming the diagnosis when clinical findings are inconclusive. treatment depends on tear pattern, vascularity, and an assessment of tissue quality. surgical decision making for the treatment of meniscal injury is based on patient factors and understanding of the meniscal structure, function, and pathology.
thalamus and posterior temporal lobe show greater inter-network connectivity at rest and across sensory paradigms in schizophrenia a growing number of studies have reported altered functional connectivity in schizophrenia during putatively “task-free” states and during the performance of cognitive tasks. however, there have been few systematic examinations of functional connectivity in schizophrenia across rest and different task states to assess the degree to which altered functional connectivity reflects a stable characteristic or whether connectivity changes vary as a function of task demands. we assessed functional connectivity during rest and during three working memory loads of an n-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) among: (1) individuals with schizophrenia (n = 19); (2) the siblings of individuals with schizophrenia (n = 28); (3) healthy controls (n = 10); and (4) the siblings of healthy controls (n = 17). we examined connectivity within and between four brain networks: (1) frontal–parietal (fp); (2) cingulo-opercular (co); (3) cerebellar (cer); and (4) default mode (dmn). in terms of within-network connectivity, we found that connectivity within the dmn and fp increased significantly between resting state and 0-back, while connectivity within the co and cer decreased significantly between resting state and 0-back. additionally, we found that connectivity within both the dmn and fp was further modulated by memory load. in terms of between network connectivity, we found that the dmn became significantly more “anti-correlated” with the fp, co, and cer networks during 0-back as compared to rest, and that connectivity between the fp and both co and cer networks increased with memory load. individuals with schizophrenia and their siblings showed consistent reductions in connectivity between both the fp and co networks with the cer network, a finding that was similar in magnitude across rest and all levels of working memory load. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered functional connectivity in schizophrenia reflects a stable characteristic that is present across cognitive states.
salt tolerance and alterations in cytosine methylation in the interspecific hybrids of fraxinus velutina and fraxinus mandshurica abstract dna methylation is known to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. in this study, we assessed the extent and pattern of cytosine methylation in the rice genome, using the technique of methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (msap), which is a modification of the amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) method that makes use of the differential sensitivity of a pair of isoschizomers to cytosine methylation. the tissues assayed included seedlings and flag leaves of an elite rice hybrid, shanyou 63, and the parental lines zhenshan 97 and minghui 63. in all, 1076 fragments, each representing a recognition site cleaved by either or both of the isoschizomers, were amplified using 16 pairs of selective primers. a total of 195 sites were found to be methylated at cytosines in one or both parents, and the two parents showed approximately the same overall degree of methylation (16.3%), as revealed by the incidence of differential digestion by the isoschizomers. four classes of patterns were identified in a comparative assay of cytosine methylation in the parents and hybrid; increased methylation was detected in the hybrid compared to the parents at some of the recognition sites, while decreased methylation in the hybrid was detected at other sites. a small proportion of the sites was found to be differentially methylated in seedlings and flag leaves; dna from young seedlings was methylated to a greater extent than that from flag leaves. almost all of the methylation patterns detected by msap could be confirmed by southern analysis using the isolated amplified fragments as probes. the results clearly demonstrate that the msap technique is highly efficient for large-scale detection of cytosine methylation in the rice genome. we believe that the technique can be adapted for use in other plant species.
histonedeacetylase inhibitor oxamflatin increase hiv-1 transcription by inducing histone modification in latently infected cells the persistence of transcriptionally silent but replication-competent hiv-1 reservoirs in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart)-treated infected individuals, represents a major hurdle to virus eradication. activation of hiv-1 gene expression in these cells together with an efficient haart has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy aimed at decreasing the pool of latent viral reservoirs. using the latently-infected u1 monocytic cell line and latently-infected j-lat t-cell clones, we here demonstrated a strong synergistic activation of hiv-1 production by clinically used histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis) combined with prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting nuclear factor (nf)- κb inducer. in j-lat cells, we showed that this synergism was due, at least partially, to the synergistic recruitment of unresponsive cells into the expressing cell population. a combination of prostratin+hdaci synergistically activated the 5′ long terminal repeat (5'ltr) from hiv-1 major group subtypes representing the most prevalent viral genetic forms, as shown by transient transfection reporter assays. mechanistically, hdacis increased prostratin-induced dna-binding activity of nuclear nf-κb and degradation of cytoplasmic nf-κb inhibitor, iκbα . moreover, the combined treatment prostratin+hdaci caused a more pronounced nucleosomal remodeling in the u1 viral promoter region than the treatments with the compounds alone. this more pronounced remodeling correlated with a synergistic reactivation of hiv-1 transcription following the combined treatment prostratin+hdaci, as demonstrated by measuring recruitment of rna polymerase ii to the 5'ltr and both initiated and elongated transcripts. the physiological relevance of the prostratin+hdaci synergism was shown in cd8+-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from haart-treated patients with undetectable viral load. moreover, this combined treatment reactivated viral replication in resting cd4+ t cells isolated from similar patients. our results suggest that combinations of different kinds of proviral activators may have important implications for reducing the size of latent hiv-1 reservoirs in haart-treated patients.
production and cleavage of a fusion protein of porcine trypsinogen and enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) in pichia pastoris the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promoter and the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor prepro secretion signal were used to drive expression and secretion of a mucin-type fusion protein by pichia pastoris in 1 l scale bioreactors. the aim of the study was to understand how varying expression rates influenced the secretion dynamics of the fusion protein in terms of intracellular- and extracellular concentrations. endoplasmic reticulum (er) folding stress was assessed by the relative expression of the unfolded protein response controlled kar2 gene. three predefined methanol feeding models were applied to control the fusion protein synthesis rate. to track the fusion protein synthesis in a non-invasive manner and to follow its intracellular distribution, its c-terminal was linked to the green fluorescent protein. under all conditions the fusion protein was found to partially accumulate intracellularly, where the major fraction was an insoluble, fluorescent full-sized protein. the high degree of glycosylation of the insoluble fusion protein indicated a secretory bottle-neck in the golgi-system. this result was consistent with low er folding stress as quantified by the relative expression of the kar2 gene. reduction of recombinant protein synthesis rate, by using lower feed rates of methanol, enhanced extracellular concentrations from 8 to 18 mg·l–1 and reduced the rate of intracellular accumulation. this clearly demonstrates the importance of tuning the synthesis rate with secretory bottle-necks to maintain secretion.
focused, unfocused, and defocused information in working memory. normal people have a strikingly low ability to detect changes in a visual scene. this has been taken as evidence that the brain represents only a few objects at a time, namely those currently in the focus of attention. in the present study, subjects were asked to detect changes in the orientation of rectangular figures in a textured display across a 1600 ms gray interval. in the first experiment, change detection improved when the location of a possible change was cued during the interval. the cue remained effective during the entire interval, but after the interval, it was ineffective, suggesting that an initially large representation was overwritten by the post-change display. to control for an effect of light intensity during the interval on the decay of the representation, we compared performance with a gray or a white interval screen in a second experiment. we found no difference between these conditions. in the third experiment, attention was occasionally misdirected during the interval by first cueing the wrong figure, before cueing the correct figure. this did not compromise performance compared to a single cue, indicating that when an item is attentionally selected, the representation of yet unchosen items remains available. in the fourth experiment, the cue was shown to be effective when changes in figure size and orientation were randomly mixed. at the time the cue appeared, subjects could not know whether size or orientation would change, therefore these results suggest that the representation contains features in their 'bound' state. together, these findings indicate that change blindness involves overwriting of a large capacity representation by the post-change display.
trauma epidemiology of women in puerto rico, 2002-2011. background:  gender modifies immunologic responses caused by severe trauma or critical illness. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gender on hospital mortality, length of intensive care unit (icu) stay, and intensity of care of patients treated in icus.
type 2 rhinovirus infection of cultured human tracheal epithelial cells: role of ldl receptor. we have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) enhances expression of interleukin-6, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor genes in human omental microvascular endothelial (home) cells in culture. in this study, we found that treatment of home cells with tnf-alpha or interleukin-1 (il-1) caused enhanced expression of low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor. a few-fold increase in both ldl binding activity and the receptor mrna levels was observed when home cells were treated with either tnf-alpha or il-1. northern blot analysis showed that cellular expression of ldl receptor gene was significantly increased 12-24 h after exposure to tnf-alpha. no significant changes in the life-span of ldl receptor mrna were observed in untreated and tnf-alpha-treated cells. scatchard analysis showed an increased receptor number for ldl in tnf-alpha-treated cells. parallel to increased ldl binding activity, internalization and degradation of ldl were also increased in home cells treated with tnf-alpha or il-1. tnf-alpha-induced enhancement of ldl receptor gene expression was not observed when cycloheximide was present. cellular mrna level of sp-1 gene was increased about 3-4-fold at 12 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription of ldl receptor gene as well as sp-1 gene by tnf-alpha. gel retardation assay with the sp-1 consensus fragment showed that sp-1 binding activity was increased about 4-5-fold 12-24 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nf-kb binding activity was also dramatically increased, but there is no nf-kb motif on the promoter for ldl receptor gene. the induction of ldl receptor by tnf might be mediated through a transcription factor, sp-1.
pathway of toll-like receptor 7/b cell activating factor/b cell activating factor receptor plays a role in immune thrombocytopenia in vivo increased levels of b lymphocyte stimulator (blys) are associated with systemic autoimmunity in animal models of spontaneous autoimmune disease, and transgenic animals expressing blys develop typical autoimmune disease. here, we demonstrate significant elevations of blys in the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). the blys isolated from the sera of sle patients had the same m.w. as the natural soluble form and was able to stimulate b cell activation in vitro. increased blys in sle patients was partially associated with higher levels of anti-dsdna ab of the igg, igm, and iga classes, but not associated with the disease activity. our results suggest that blys may be a useful marker for early activation of an autoimmune diathesis and likely plays a critical role in triggering activation of self-ag-driven autoimmune b cells in human sle. blys may provide an effective therapeutic target in systemic autoimmunity.
quantification of canola root morphological traits under heat and drought stresses with electrical measurements analysis of plant root systems is difficult under field conditions, especially root systems of adult trees, which are large and complex and include fine absorbing roots as well as conducting coarse roots. although coarse roots can be visualized by several methods, there are technical difficulties with root quantification. the method presented here focuses on the quantification of absorbing root surfaces through an electrical (the modified earth impedance) method. it is based on the experimentally verified fact that an applied electric current flows from the roots to the soil (or vice versa) through the same interfacial areas and predominantly in the same way as water (water solution of minerals or nutrients) flows from the soil to the tree. based on the different conductivities of tree tissues and soil, the interfacial area, which represents the absorbing root surfaces (or root absorption zones), can be calculated. only the theoretical description of the method is presented in this paper: the experimental verification of the method under field conditions is presented in the accompanying paper.
the phylogenomic analysis of the anaphase promoting complex and its targets points to complex and modern-like control of the cell cycle in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes abstract. molecular phylogenetic analyses have recently shown that the unicellular amoeboid protist capsaspora owczarzaki is unlikely to be a nucleariid or an ichthyosporean as previously described, but is more closely related to metazoa, choanoflagellata, and ichthyosporea. however, the specific phylogenetic relationship of capsaspora to other protist opisthokont lineages was poorly resolved. to test these earlier results we have expanded both the taxonomic sampling and the number of genes from opisthokont unicellular lineages. we have sequenced the protein‐coding genes elongation factor 1‐α (ef1‐α) and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) from c. owczarzaki and the ichthyosporean sphaeroforma arctica. our maximum likelihood (ml) and bayesian analyses of a concatenated alignment of ef1‐α, hsp70, and actin protein sequences with a better sampling of opisthokont‐related protist lineages indicate that c. owczarzaki is not clearly allied with any of the unicellular opisthokonts, but represents an independent unicellular lineage closely related to animals and choanoflagellates. moreover, we have found that the ichthyosporean s. arctica possesses an ef‐like (efl) gene copy instead of the canonical ef1‐α, the first so far described in an ichthyosporean. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis shows that the ef‐like gene of s. arctica strongly groups with the ef‐like genes from choanoflagellates. finally, to begin characterizing the capsaspora genome, we have performed pulsed‐field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analyses, which indicate that its genome has at least 12 chromosomes with a total genome size in the range of 22–25 mb.
snow-induced changes in dwarf birch chemistry increase moth larval growth rate and level of herbivory insect damage changes plant physiology and chemistry, and such changes may influence the performance of herbivores. we introduced larvae of the autumnal moth (epirrita autumnataborkh.) on individual branches of its main host plant, mountain birch (betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (orlova) hämet-ahti) to examine rapid-induced plant responses, which may affect subsequent larval development. we measured systemic responses to herbivory by analyzing chemistry, photosynthesis, and leaf growth, as well as effects on larval growth and feeding, in undamaged branches of damaged and control trees. larvae reared on leaves from intact branches of the herbivore-damaged trees grew faster than those reared on leaves of control trees, indicating systemic-induced susceptibility. herbivore damage did not lead to systemic changes in levels of primary nutrients or phenolic compounds. the analyses of photosynthetic activity and individual hydrolyzable tannins revealed a reversal of leaf physiology-herbivore defense patterns. on control trees, consumption by e. autumnata larvae was positively correlated with photosynthetic activity; on damaged trees, this correlation was reversed, with consumption being negatively correlated with photosynthetic activity. a similar pattern was found in the relationship between monogalloylglucose, the most abundant hydrolyzable tannin of mountain birch, and leaf consumption. among the control trees, consumption was positively correlated with concentrations of monogalloylglucose, whereas among herbivore-damaged trees, this correlation was reversed and became negative. our results suggest that herbivore performance is related to both concentrations of phenolic compounds and photosynthetic activity in leaves. this linkage between herbivore performance, leaf chemistry, and physiology was sensitive to induced plant responses caused by slight herbivore damage.
secretion of stress protein grp170 promotes immune-mediated inhibition of murine prostate tumor abstract. several studies have suggested a positive correlation between heat shock protein (hsp) expression and tumor immunogenicity. independently, many studies have shown that hsp purified from tumors can be used as a tumor-specific vaccine. in this study, we have explored the connection between hsp expression and anti-tumor immunity by transducing murine ct26 colon carcinoma cells with the cdna of a major hsp, i.e. hsp110. we have shown that over-expression of hsp110 has no effect on ct26 tumor cell growth in vitro, and does not inhibit their anchorage-independent growth capacity. however, in situ, hsp110 over-expressing ct26 tumor (ct26-hsp110) grew at a significantly reduced rate as compared to the wild-type ct26 tumor in immunocompetent mice. moreover, immunization of mice with inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells significantly inhibited the growth of wild-type ct26 tumor. this immunity was associated with an increased frequency of tumor-specific t cells after vaccination. an in vivo antibody depletion assay demonstrated that inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells elicited anti-tumor responses involving cd8+ t cells and natural killer (nk) cells, but not cd4+ t cells. lastly, the effect of the addition of granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm–csf) to these vaccine formulations was determined. mice immunized with irradiated ct26-hsp110 cells combined with gm–csf-producing bystander cells revealed a complete inhibition of ct26 tumor growth, indicating a synergy between inactivated ct26-hsp110 vaccine activity and gm–csf. these observations demonstrate that manipulation of hsp110 expression in tumors, specifically when combined with gm–csf, represents a potentially powerful approach to cancer vaccine formulation.
influence of obesity and body fat distribution on postprandial lipemia and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in adult women. apoliprotein (apo) b-100-containing very low density lipoprotein (vldl) particles secreted from the liver accumulate in plasma during alimentary lipemia. to determine whether changes of vldl composition occur in the postprandial state that may render these lipoproteins more atherogenic, apoe, c-i, c-ii, and c-iii, and lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol) were measured in svedberg flotation (sf) 60-400 (large) and sf 20-60 (small) vldl before and after an oral fat load. ten normotriglyceridemic (ntg) and three hypertriglyceridemic (htg) healthy men were given a fat-rich mixed meal (1,000 kcal with 60.2 e% from fat). triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from plasma samples obtained before (fasting) and at 2-h intervals after the meal. vldl was then separated from chylomicrons and their remnants by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies 4g3 and 5e11, recognizing apob-100, but not apob-48 epitopes. large and small vldl isolated from the ntg group were enriched with apoe and c-i, and cholesterol, but depleted of apoc-ii in the postprandial state, whereas the apoc-iii, triglyceride, and phospholipid contents were essentially unchanged. the compositional changes of vldl in htg subjects were similar but more pronounced compared with ntg subjects. we conclude that postprandial lipemia in healthy men induces transient compositional alterations of vldl that link these lipoprotein species to the formation of atherosclerosis.
percutaneous guided biopsy for diagnosing suspected primary malignant bone tumors in pediatric patients: a safe, accurate, and cost-saving procedure the most appropriate protocol for the biopsy of musculoskeletal tumours is controversial, with some authors advocating ct-guided core biopsy. at our hospital the initial biopsies of most musculoskeletal tumours has been by operative core biopsy with evaluation by frozen section which determines whether diagnostic tissue has been obtained and, if possible, gives the definitive diagnosis. in order to determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this protocol we have undertaken a retrospective audit of biopsies of musculoskeletal tumours performed over a period of two years. a total of 104 patients had biopsies according to this regime. all gave the diagnosis apart from one minor error which did not alter the management of the patient. there was no requirement for re-biopsy. this protocol was more labour-intensive and 38% more costly than ct-guided core biopsy (au$1804 vs au$1308). however, the accuracy and avoidance of the anxiety associated with repeat biopsy outweighed these disadvantages.
inaca inak ical if irel ipca iup icab ileak ina ito ikr icak inab ikb iks ik 1 inaca , i inak ical icana irelitr ipca iup icabinaca , ss midwall endocardium the underlying mechanism of torsade de pointes (tdp) remains of debate: perpetuation may be due to (1) focal activity or (2) re‐entrant activity. the onset of tdp correlates with action potential heterogeneities in different regions of the heart. we studied the mechanism of perpetuation of tdp in silico using a 2d model of human cardiac tissue and an anatomically accurate model of the ventricles of the human heart. we found that the mechanism of perpetuation tdp depends on the degree of heterogeneity. if the degree of heterogeneity is large, focal activity alone can sustain a tdp, otherwise re‐entrant activity emerges. this result can help to understand the relationship between the mechanisms of tdp and tissue properties and may help in developing new drugs against it.
cranial growth in normal and low-protein-fed saimiri. an environmental heterochrony. improvements in data gathering technology have made it possible to quickly and accurately digitize large numbers of objects. the three dimensional coordinates of 44 homologous landmarks were obtained from a sample of 104 squirrel monkey (saimiri sciureus) crania. after sorting by sex, the crania were assigned to one of four dental age groups. two quantitative methods, euclidean distance matrix analysis (edma) and finite element scaling analysis (fesa), were used to study craniofacial form change during growth within each sex. form differences between the sexes at each developmental age were also examined. both sexes show a small amount of cranial growth overall; however, there are areas of substantial local growth. these areas include the anterior neurocranium and basicranium, the basioccipital, and the anterior palate. sexual dimorphism in the craniofacial complex is minimal. the most dimorphic regions are the orbitonasal portion of the lower face, the cranial base, and the palate.
can pubertal boys with klinefelter syndrome benefit from spermatogonial stem cell banking? context the pathogenesis and mechanisms behind the degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in testes of subjects with klinefelter syndrome (ks) are yet unknown.   objective the objective of this prospective clinical study was to characterize the testicular degeneration process during puberty in boys with ks by describing the immunoexpression of some developmentally regulated markers of testis maturation in relation to serum levels of reproductive hormones.   setting this study was conducted at a university central hospital pediatric referral endocrinology outpatient clinic.   patients patients consisted of 14 boys with ks aged 10.1 to 14.0 yr.   main outcome measures main outcome measures were immunoexpression of germ cell differentiation markers (ap-2gamma, chk2, oct-3/4, ny-eso-1, mage-a4) and androgen action-related proteins [androgen receptor (ar), anti-müllerian hormone (amh), mic2, inhibin b; alpha- and betab-subunits] in testicular biopsies of boys with ks in relation to serum reproductive hormone levels.   results in boys with ks, gonocytes differentiated to the spermatogonium stage, but no spermatocytes were visible. despite this, down-regulation of amh expression in the sertoli cells occurred concomitantly with decreasing serum amh levels. expression of inhibin alpha- and betab-subunits appeared in the biopsies even when circulating inhibin b levels were undetectable. in the boys with ks compared with age-matched controls, the proportion of sertoli cell nuclei expressing ar was smaller and cytoplasmic staining of sertoli cells was constantly present.   conclusions we showed with several testis-specific markers in ks that gonocytes differentiate to spermatogonia and that the degeneration of the testes accelerates at the onset of puberty. altered immunoexpression of ar indicates that a relative androgen deficiency, at least at the testicular level, develops in boys with ks during puberty.
preoperative hospital length of stay as a modifiable risk factor for mediastinitis after cardiac surgery mediastinitis is a dreaded complication of cabg surgery. short-term outcomes have been described, but there have been only a few long-term studies. we examined the survival of patients undergoing isolated cabg surgery between 1992 and 2001. mediastinitis was identified during the index admission. proportional hazards regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci 95%). among 36,078 consecutive patients, there were 5749 deaths during 148,319 person years of follow-up. there were 418 cases of mediastinitis (1.16%). the incidence of death was 11.15 per 100 person/years with mediastinitis and 3.81 deaths/100 person years without. (p < 0.001). we also examined the mortality rates of patients who survived at least 6 months after their cabg surgery. patients with mediastinitis had an incidence rate of 5.70 deaths per 100 person/years while those without had a rate of 2.66 deaths per 100 person/years (p < 0.001). after adjustment for baseline differences in patient and disease characteristics, the hazard ratio was 2.12 (ci95% = 1.86,2.58; p < 0.001). the adjusted hazard ratios for patients who survived 6 months postsurgery was 1.70 (ci95% = 1.36,2.13; p < 0.001). mediastinitis is associated with a marked increase in both acute and long-term mortality rates.
meal-induced insulin sensitization is preserved after acute olanzapine administration in female sprague-dawley rats selective dopamine d(2) antogonists increase meal size and decrease the rate of feeding within a meal. three experiments investigated the extent to which the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, and the prototypical antipsychotic, haloperidol, affected meal size and feeding rate. microstructural analyses of meal patterning were made over a range of drug doses administered to free feeding male lister hooded rats. haloperidol and clozapine produced a short-term increase in food intake. haloperidol (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) enhanced meal size (maximal at 0.1 mg/kg) and reduced feeding rate (monotonic decrease with increasing dose). neither clozapine (1-10 mg/kg) nor olanzapine (0.3-3 mg/kg) enhanced meal size, although both drugs produced similar reductions in feeding rate to haloperidol. these data suggest that enhancement of meal size may be correlated with a high level of extrapyramidal side effects in an antipsychotic drug. the absence of an increase in meal size by two atypical compounds suggests that the increase in body weight associated with clinical treatment with these drugs cannot be modelled by acute stimulation of meal size in the rat.
determinants of adenomyosis in women who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions: results from a prospective multicentric study in italy. epidemiological studies of adenomyosis are difficult to interpret because the diagnostic criteria vary so widely that the disease may be easily over-diagnosed. this would severely hamper any attempt to define incidence and prevalence of the condition and the related risk factors, and would limit the possibility of clarifying to what extent adenomyosis contributes to clinical symptoms. there is a need for stringent and widely accepted diagnostic criteria in order to define not only the presence of adenomyosis but also depth of penetration and degree of spread of foci. moreover, the evidence available on epidemiological characteristics of women with adenomyosis is greatly biased by the type of population studied, i.e. women undergoing hysterectomy. therefore, a consensus on non-surgical diagnostic criteria at transvaginal ultrasonography and mri is indispensable and urgently needed in order to be able to conduct epidemiological studies in women younger than those evaluated until now.
effects of heat exposure on muscle oxidation and protein functionalities of pectoralis majors in broilers. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chemical oxidation on proteolysis susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins. myofibrils were prepared from pig m. longissimus dorsi and oxidised by a hydroxyl radical generating system. protein oxidation level was measured by the carbonyl content, free thiol group content and bityrosine formation. oxidised or non-oxidised myofibrillar proteins were exposed to papain and proteolysis was estimated by fluorescence using fluorescamine. oxidation of myofibrillar proteins was dependent upon the oxidising agent concentration. disulfide bridge and bityrosine formation indicated that oxidation by oh° can induce protein polymerization. electrophoretic study showed that myosin was the protein most sensitive to oxidation. results showed a direct and quantitative relationship between protein damages by hydroxyl radical and decreased proteolytic susceptibility. electrophoretic observations suggest that polymerization and aggregation may explain in part decreased susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins to proteolysis.
molecular typing and phenotype characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates from blood in taiwan abstract clonal complex 59 (cc59) community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa) strains were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, diagnostic dna microarrays, and pcrs targeting staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) elements and panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl). six distinct groups within cc59 were characterized. at least seven different variants of sccmec elements were identified (iva [2b], ivb [2b], ivd [2b], iv variant [2b], iva [2b&5], v variant [5c2], and v [5c2&5]). (the structural type is indicated by a roman numeral, with a lowercase letter indicating the subtype, and the ccr complex and the mec complex are indicated by an arabic numeral and an uppercase letter, respectively. where there is an extra ccr element, this is indicated by “&” and an arabic numeral designating the ccr type.) the first group is similar to the american sequence type 59 (st59) mrsa-iv ca-mrsa strain usa1000. the second group includes a pvl-negative st87 strain with an sccmec element of subtype ivb (2b). the third group comprises pvl-variable st59 mrsa-iv strains harboring multiple sccmec iv subtypes. pvl-negative st59 mrsa strains with multiple or composite sccmec elements (iva [2b&5]) form the fourth group. group 5 corresponds to the internationally known “taiwan clone,” a pvl-positive strain with a variant sccmec element (v [5c2&5]). this strain proved to be the most common cc59 mrsa strain isolated in western australia. finally, group 6 encompasses the st59 mrsa-v variant (5c2). the differentiation of cc59 into groups and strains indicates a rapid evolution and spread of sccmec elements. observed differences between groups of strains as well as intrastrain variability within a group facilitate the tracing of their spread.
the association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(rarβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis background gene expression can be silenced through the methylation of specific sites in the promoter region. this mechanism of gene silencing has an important role in the carcinogenesis of prostate and other cancers. although tumor-associated stromal cells also exhibit changes in gene expression, promoter methylation has not been described in these cells.   methods tumor epithelia, tumor-associated stroma and normal epithelia, and stroma adjacent to tumor tissues were isolated from whole-mount prostatectomy specimens (two per patient) of patients (n = 5) with localized prostate cancer and from normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens (two per patient) from men (n = 5) without prostate cancer by using laser capture microdissection or expression microdissection. the methylation status of three genes important in prostate carcinogenesis, gstp1, rarbeta2, and cd44, were evaluated using quantitative methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction.   results gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in the tumor epithelium of all five prostate cancer patients and in the tumor-associated stroma in four of the five patients. cd44 was methylated in the tumor epithelium from four of the five patients but not in the tumor stroma. gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in normal epithelium of two and four patients, respectively, and in normal stroma of one and two patients, respectively, that were isolated from regions adjacent to the tumors and may have resulted from a tumor-field effect; cd44 methylation was not observed in normal epithelium or stroma. in contrast, normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens showed no promoter methylation in gstp1, rarbeta2, or cd44.   conclusions the observation of promoter methylation in the non-neoplastic cells of the prostate tumor microenvironment may advance our understanding of prostate cancer development and progression and lead to new diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
the relation of hpv infection and expression of p53 and p16 proteins in esophageal squamous cells carcinoma molecular prognostic indicators for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (oscc), including hpv‐dna detection, epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and p16 expression, have been suggested in the literature, but none of these are currently used in clinical practice. to compare these predictors, 106 newly diagnosed oscc for the presence of hpv‐dna and expression of p16 and egfr were analyzed. the 5‐year disease‐free survival (dfs) and overall survival (os) were calculated in relation to these markers and a multivariate cox analysis was performed. twenty‐eight percent of the cases contained oncogenic hpv‐dna and 30% were positive for p16. the p16 expression was highly correlated with the presence of hpv‐dna (p < 0.001). univariate analysis of the 5‐year dfs revealed a significantly better outcome for patients with p16‐positive tumors (84% vs. 49%, p = 0.009). egfr‐negative tumors showed a tendency toward a better prognosis in dfs (74% vs. 47%, p = 0.084) and os (70% vs. 45%, p = 0.100). remarkable and highly significant was the combination of p16 and egfr expression status, leading to 5‐year dfs of 93% for p16+/egfr− tumors vs. 39% for p16−/egfr+ tumors (p = 0.003) and to a 5‐year os of 79% vs. 38%, respectively (p = 0.010). in multivariate analysis p16 remained a highly significant prognostic marker for dfs (p = 0.030) showing a 7.5‐fold increased risk for relapse in patients with p16‐negative tumors. our data indicate that p16 expression is the most reliable prognostic marker for oscc and further might be a surrogate marker for hpv‐positive oscc. hpv+/p16+ tumors tended to have decreased egfr expression, but using both immunohistological markers has significant prognostic implications. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
intact implicit probabilistic sequence learning in obstructive sleep apnea study objective to investigate which memory processes are affected by obstructive sleep apnea (osa).   design three separate memory systems were investigated in patients with osa and normal subjects. verbal episodic memory was tested after forced encoding, in order to control the level of attention during item presentation; procedural memory was tested using a simplified version of a standard test with an interfering task; lastly, working memory was examined with validated paradigms based on a theoretical model.   setting sleep laboratory and outpatient sleep clinic in a french tertiary-care university hospital.   participants ninety-five patients with osa and 95 control subjects matched for age and level of education. group 1 (54 patients, 54 controls) underwent an extensive battery of tasks evaluating verbal episodic, procedural, and working memory. group 2 (16 patients, 16 controls) underwent procedural memory tests only, and group 3 (25 patients, 25 controls) working memory tests only.   interventions n/a.   measurements and results compared with matched controls, patients with osa exhibited a retrieval deficit of episodic memory but intact maintenance, recognition, and forgetfulness; decreased overall performance in procedural memory, although pattern learning did occur; and impairment of specific working memory capabilities despite normal short-term memory. no consistent correlation was found between osa severity and memory deficit. the long duration of the test session did not negatively impact the patients' performance.   conclusions memory impairment in osa is mild and does not affect all memory processes but, rather, specific aspects, underscoring the need for extensive and specific memory testing in clinical and research settings.
effects of temporal heterogeneity of water supply and nutrient levels on plant biomass growth depend on the plant’s relative size within its population background and aims size-asymmetric competition occurs when larger plants have a disproportionate advantage in competition with smaller plants. it has been hypothesized that nutrient heterogeneity may promote it. experiments testing this hypothesis are inconclusive, and in most cases have evaluated the effects of nutrient heterogeneity separately from other environmental factors. the aim of this study was to test, using populations of lolium perenne, plantago lanceolata and holcus lanatus, two hypotheses: (a) nutrient heterogeneity promotes size-asymmetric competition; and (b) nutrient heterogeneity interacts with both atmospheric co2 partial pressure (p(co2)) and nutrient availability to determine the magnitude of this response.   methods microcosms consisting of monocultures of the three species were grown for 90 d in a factorial experiment with the following treatments: p(co2) (37.5 and 70 pa) and nutrient availability (na; 40 and 120 mg of n added as organic material) combined with different spatial distribution of the organic material (nh; homogeneous and heterogeneous). differences in the size of individual plants within populations (size inequality) were quantified using the coefficient of variation of individual above-ground biomass and the combined biomass of the two largest individuals in each microcosm. increases in size inequality were associated with size-asymmetric competition.   key results size inequality increased when the nutrients were heterogeneously supplied in the three species. the effects of nh on this response were more pronounced under high nutrient supply in both plantago and holcus (significant na x nh interactions) and under elevated p(co2) in plantago (significant p(co2) x na x nh interaction). no significant two- and three-way interactions were found for lolium.   conclusions our first hypothesis was supported by our results, as nutrient heterogeneity promoted size-asymmetric competition in the three species evaluated. nutrient supply and p(co2) modified the magnitude of this effect in plantago and holcus, but not in lolium. thus, our second hypothesis was partially supported.
the effect of reactive oxygen species on ethylene production induced by osmotic stress in etiolated mungbean seedling abstract. the production of ethylene by mesocarp tissue of winter squash is induced by mechanical wounding. we isolated a cdna fragment (wsacs2) from the wounded mesocarp tissue of winter-squash (cucurbita maxima duch.) fruit by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using primers that corresponded to two conserved amino acid sequences found in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) synthases. the sequence of wsacs2 cdna was almost identical to that of the cdna for a wound-inducible acc synthase (cm-acs1) reported by n. nakajima et␣al. 1990, plant cell physiol 31: 1021–1029, with only one nucleotide difference. the expression of the wsacs2 transcript in tissue disks was examined by northern blotting analysis. the accumulation of wsacs2 mrna in the wounded tissue disks was inhibited by treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, which is known as an inhibitor of superoxide-generating nad(p)h oxidases. the addition of xanthine and xanthine oxidase, which form a superoxide-generating system, strongly induced the accumulation of the wsacs2 transcript within 30 min and the level of the transcript fell thereafter. we measured levels of active oxygen species that were generated in the tissue disks by using chemiluminescence reagents and found that the chemiluminescence signal became apparent within a few seconds after wounding. the synthesis of the wsacs2 transcript was slightly inhibited by inhibitors of lipoxygenase, which is involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid. methyl jasmonate stimulated the synthesis of the wsacs2 transcript in the tissue disks.
impact of interpregnancy interval on the subsequent risk of adverse perinatal outcomes objective: to estimate whether interpregnancy interval is independently associated with increased risk of perinatal death and other adverse perinatal outcomes. methods: we investigated the effect of interpregnancy interval on perinatal outcomes in 1,125,430 pregnancies recorded in the perinatal information system database of the latin american center for perinatology and human development, montevideo, uruguay, between 1985 and 2004. odds ratios (ors) were adjusted for 16 major confounding factors using multiple logistic regression models. results: compared with infants with interpregnancy intervals of 18–23 months, those born to women with intervals shorter than 6 months had an increased risk of early neonatal death (adjusted or 1.49, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.06–1.96), fetal death (adjusted or 1.54, 95% ci 1.28–1.83), low birth weight (adjusted or 1.88, 95% ci 1.78–1.90), very low birth weight (adjusted or 2.01, 95% ci 1.73–2.31), preterm birth (adjusted or 1.80, 95% ci 1.71–1.89), very preterm birth (adjusted or 1.95, 95% ci 1.67–2.26), and small for gestational age (adjusted or 1.30, 95% ci 1.25–1.36). intervals of 6–11 months and 60 months and longer were also associated with a significantly greater risk for the 7 adverse perinatal outcomes. conclusion: in latin america, interpregnancy intervals shorter than 12 months and longer than 59 months are independently associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. these data suggest that spacing pregnancies appropriately could prevent perinatal deaths and other adverse perinatal outcomes in the developing world. level of evidence: ii-2
obesity management and continuing medical education in primary care: results of a swiss survey obesity is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with cvd and increased morbidity and mortality. when the bmi is > or = 30 kg/m2, mortality rates from all causes, and especially cvd, are increased by 50% to 100%. there is strong evidence that weight loss in overweight and obese individuals improves risk factors for diabetes and cvd. additional evidence indicates that weight loss and the associated diuresis reduce blood pressure in both overweight hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals, reduce serum tg levels, increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and may produce some reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. of interest, even if weight loss is minimal, obese individuals showing a good level of cardiorespiratory fitness are at reduced risk for cardiovascular mortality than lean but poorly fit subjects. insulin and catecholamines have pronounced metabolic effects on human adipose tissue metabolism. insulin stimulates lpl and inhibits hsl; the opposite is true for catecholamines. there is regional variation in adipocyte tg turnover favoring lipid mobilization in the visceral fat depots and lipid storage in the peripheral subcutaneous sites. the hormonal regulation of adipocyte tg turnover is altered in obesity and is most marked in central obesity. there is resistance to insulin stimulation of lpl; however, lpl activity in fasted obese subjects is increased and remains so following weight reduction. catecholamine-induced lipolysis is enhanced in visceral fat but decreased in subcutaneous fat. numerous adaptive responses take place with physical training. these adaptations result in a more efficient system for oxygen transfer to muscle, which is now able to better utilize the unlimited lipid stores instead of the limited carbohydrate reserves available. in addition, the reduced adipose tissue mass represents an important mechanical advantage, allowing better long-term work. gender differences have been reported in the adaptation of adipose tissue metabolism to aerobic exercise training. physical training helps counteract the permissive and affluent environment that predisposes reduced-obese subjects to regain weight. an exercise program using weight resistance modalities may also be included safely, and it improved program retention in a multidisciplinary weight management program that was designed for obese children. thirty to 45 minutes of physical activity of moderate intensity, performed 3 to 5 days a week, should be encouraged. all adults should set a long-term goal to accumulate at least 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, and preferably all days. public health interventions promoting walking are likely to be the most successful. indeed, walking is unique because of its safety, accessibility, and popularity. it is noteworthy that there is a clear dissociation between the adaptation of cardiorespiratory fitness and the improvements in the metabolic risk profile that can be induced by endurance training programs. it appears that as long as the increase in energy expenditure is sufficient, low-intensity endurance exercise is likely to generate beneficial metabolic effects that would be essentially similar to those produced by high-intensity exercise. the clinician should therefore focus on the improvement of the metabolic profile rather than on weight loss alone. realistic goals should be set between the clinician and the patient, with a weight loss of approximately of 0.5 to 1 pound per week. it should be kept in mind that since it generally takes years to become overweight or obese, a weight loss pattern of 0.5 or 1 pound per week will require time and perseverance to reach the proposed target. however, the use of physical activity as a method to lose weight seems inversely related to patients' age and bmi and directly related to the level of education. thus, public health interventions helping these groups to become physically active remain a challenge and further emphasize the importance of the one-on-one interaction between the clinician/health care professional with the obese individual "at risk" of cvd. this notion is critical, as it has been shown that less than half of obese adults have reported being advised to lose weight under the guidance of health care professionals.
arabinosylated lipoarabinomannan skews th2 phenotype towards th1 during leishmania infection by chromatin modification: involvement of mapk signaling the cell wall component lipoarabinomannan (manlam) from mycobacterium tuberculosis is involved in the inhibition of phagosome maturation, apoptosis and interferon (ifn)‐γ signalling in macrophages and interleukin (il)‐12 cytokine secretion of dendritic cells (dc). all these processes are important for the host to mount an efficient immune response. conversely, lam isolated from non‐pathogenic mycobacteria (pilam) have the opposite effect, by inducing a potent proinflammatory response in macrophages and dcs. lams from diverse mycobacterial species differ in the modification of their terminal arabinose residues. the strong proinflammatory response induced by pilam correlates with the presence of phospho‐myo‐inositol on the terminal arabinose. interestingly, recent work indicates that the biosynthetic precursor of lam, lipomannan (lm), which is also present in the cell wall, displays strong proinflammatory effects, independently of which mycobacterial species it is isolated from. results from in vitro assays and knock‐out mice suggest that lm, like pilam, mediates its biological activity via toll‐like receptor 2. we hypothesize that the lam/lm ratio might be a crucial factor in determining the virulence of a mycobacterial species and the outcome of the infection. recent progress in the identification of genes involved in the biosynthesis of lam is discussed, in particular with respect to the fact that enzymes controlling the lam/lm balance might represent targets for new antitubercular drugs. in addition, inactivation of these genes may lead to attenuated strains of m. tuberculosis for the development of new vaccine candidates.
non-radioactive serological diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and clinical features of patients from tianjin, china approximately 15% of 1patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (mg) lack detectable circulating antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (achrab), referred to as seronegative mg (snmg). during the last 3 years, antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (muskab) were found in about 40 to 70% of patients with snmg.1–5⇓⇓⇓⇓ we report the first muskab survey among chinese patients with snmg and compare the features of muskab-positive patients with those of caucasian patients.  during last 10 years, we collected data from 774 myasthenic patients (389 with the ocular type and 385 generalized type) at the shin kong wu ho-su memorial hospital. among patients with generalized mg, 38 (9.8%) were seronegative for achrab. we enrolled 26 of these patients, who had been monitored regularly; 20 were women and 6 were men (table). twenty patients were in osserman stage iia, four were in iib, and two patients were in stage iii. limb weakness was the most common …
increased sparsity of hippocampal ca1 neuronal ensembles in a mouse model of down syndrome assayed by arc expression we have assessed the effects of enriched environment (ee) upon behavioral and cognitive performances of partially trisomic ts65dn (ts) mice and their control (co) littermates. enriched environment was applied to pups for 7 weeks after weaning. circadian spontaneous activity (actimetry), exploratory behavior (hole board), activity in the open field and spatial memory (morris water maze, repeated acquisition and cued paradigms) were analyzed in 86 female and 75 male mice, starting 15 days after completing enrichment. for each gender, mice were distributed in non-enriched and enriched control and trisomic groups. enriched environment reduced in trisomic females and enhanced in trisomic males' circadian activity. exploratory behavior was increased by enrichment in all groups, regardless of gender or presence of trisomy. in the morris water maze, a significant improvement of the spatial memory was observed in enriched-control females, but not in enriched-control male mice, as assessed by distances traveled. performances in the four groups of control animals were also consistently and significantly better than those of matching trisomic mice. in the acquisition trials, enrichment improved performance in trisomic female animals, but deteriorated in trisomic male mice. in all groups, changes in escape latencies and distances induced by enrichment were accounted for by changes in the total time spent in the periphery of the pool, indicating changes in learning strategy. working memory was the function more affected by enrichment. it is concluded that enriched environment induces behavioral and learning changes in trisomic mice, although gender plays a significant modulatory role.
effects of supplemental progesterone on the development, metabolism and blastocyst cell number of bovine embryos produced in vitro. the steroid hormone progesterone (p(4)) plays a key role in the reproductive events associated with pregnancy establishment and maintenance. high concentrations of circulating p(4) in the immediate post-conception period have been associated with an advancement of conceptus elongation, an associated increase in interferon-tau production and higher pregnancy rates in cattle. using in vitro and in vivo models and approximately 8500 bovine oocytes across six experiments, the aim of this study was to establish the route through which p(4) affects bovine embryo development in vitro and in vivo. mrna for p(4) receptors was present at all stages of embryo development raising the possibility of a direct effect of p(4) on the embryo. exposure to p(4) in vitro in the absence or presence of oviduct epithelial cells did not affect the proportion of embryos developing to the blastocyst stage, blastocyst cell number or the relative abundance of selected transcripts in the blastocyst. furthermore, exposure to p(4) in vitro did not affect post-hatching elongation of the embryo following transfer to synchronized recipients and recovery on day 14. by contrast, transfer of in vitro derived blastocysts to a uterine environment previously primed by elevated p(4) resulted in a fourfold increase in conceptus length on day 14. these data provide clear evidence to support the hypothesis that p(4)-induced changes in the uterine environment are responsible for the advancement in conceptus elongation reported previously in cattle and that, interestingly, the embryo does not need to be present during the period of high p(4) in order to exhibit advanced elongation.
characterization of plasma cholinesterase in rabbit and evaluation of the inhibitory potential of diazinon. an automated procedure for estimation of blood cholinesterase activities was evaluated and used to determine baseline cholinesterase activities in rabbits. in addition, the kinetics of cholinesterase inhibition and recovery from diazinon challenge were determined by use of this procedure. the procedure developed is a modification of the colorimetric ellman technique, adapted for use with the instrumentation laboratory multistat iii plus centrifugal analyzer. the substrate used in this technique was acetylthiocholine. baseline cholinesterase activities in domestic rabbits were plasma cholinesterase, 360 mu/ml; red blood cell cholinesterase, 2,658 mu/ml; and whole blood cholinesterase, 1,332 mu/ml. rabbits were challenged with 0.3 ld50 (40 mg/kg) of diazinon, and blood samples were obtained at hourly, then daily intervals. cholinesterase activity in these samples was determined to monitor the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor diazinon in vivo, as estimated by the multistat iii plus centrifugal analyzer procedure. plasma cholinesterase activity decreased to 4% within 6 h, whereas red blood cell cholinesterase activity decreased to 51%. by 10 days, plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase activities had returned to 100 and 91%, respectively, of pre-challenge activities.
energy expenditure of extreme competitive mountaineering skiing aim the purpose of this study is to determine the energy cost (ec) of ski mountaineering and its variation with speed and ankle loading.   methods seven male skiers volunteered to participate in this study. field tests (500 m, gradient 21%) were executed on packed snow at an altitude of about 1600 m. measurements were carried out breath by breath by a portable gas analyzer. energy cost of uphill skiing was calculated from the steady state vo(2). in the speed protocol each subject was asked to repeat the same route at three different speed levels. in the weight protocol, subjects were instructed to maintain the preferred speed for three trials on the same track while wearing different weight bands on their ankle.   results at the self-selected speed of 1.07+/-0.05 m s(-1) and without extra load beside the normal equipment, the mean value of ec on packed snow is 10.6+/-0.4 j kg(-1m)(-1). a percentage variation of the speed (%speed) produces a corresponding percentage variation of the energy cost %ec = 0.32 x %speed. the %ec as a function of the percentage of added load, %weight, with respect to the total weight of the subject, including ski, bindings, and boots is given by %ec = 1.71 x %weight.   conclusions data obtained in the present study constitute the first quantitative description of ec for ski mountaineering and result higher than for walking or snowshoeing. effects due to ankle loading appear negligible for recreational skiers, while they should be taken into account in agonistic competition.
human cytomegalovirus ie 86 attenuates virus-and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nf b-dependent gene expression the activation of nf-kappab has long been considered a positive factor for human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) replication. the hcmv immediate-early promoter, the initial transcriptional element in the hcmv replication cycle, is activated by the transcription factor nf-kappab, and several hcmv gene products have been demonstrated to activate this transcription factor. however, the role of nf-kappab in the full replication cycle of the virus has not been carefully examined. a series of experiments that demonstrate an important inhibitory role of nf-kappab for hcmv replication in fibroblasts is presented here. using both genetic and pharmaceutical methods, it was shown that blocking nf-kappab activation in cell culture does not inhibit hcmv replication, but rather leads to a modest increase in replication. two cytokines inhibitory for hcmv, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, no longer inhibit hcmv when nf-kappab activation is blocked. furthermore, forced expression of the nf-kappab activating ikappab kinase beta (ikkbeta), but not a kinase inactive mutant, also inhibits hcmv replication. in addition, it was shown that nf-kappab signalling is essential for the production of an anti-viral factor in the supernatant of hcmv-infected fibroblasts, and identified interferon-beta as this factor. thus, the role of nf-kappab in fibroblasts is to activate a host defence against hcmv.
climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
development of negative feedback during successive growth cycles of black cherry the janzen–connell hypothesis proposes that host-specific, distance- and/or density-dependent predators and herbivores maintain high tree diversity in tropical forests. negative feedback between plant and soil communities could be a more effective mechanism promoting species coexistence because soil pathogens can increase rapidly in the presence of their host, causing conditions unfavourable for local conspecific recruitment. here we show that a soil pathogen leads to patterns of seedling mortality in a temperate tree (prunus serotina) as predicted by the janzen–connell hypothesis. in the field, the mean distance to parent of seedling cohorts shifted away from maternal trees over a period of 3 years. seedlings were grown in soil collected 0–5 m or 25–30 m from prunus trees. sterilization of soil collected beneath trees improved seedling survival relative to unsterilized soil, whereas sterilization of distant soil did not affect survival. pythium spp., isolated from roots of dying seedlings and used to inoculate healthy seedlings, decreased survival by 65% relative to controls. our results provide the most complete evidence that native pathogens influence tree distributions, as predicted by the janzen–connell hypothesis, and suggest that similar ecological mechanisms operate in tropical and temperate forests.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
muscle length and lengthening velocity in voluntary crouch gait. the purpose of this study was to characterize biomechanically three different crouch walking patterns, artificially induced in eight neurologically intact subjects and to compare them to selected cases of pathological crouch walking. the subjects were equipped with a lightweight mechanical exoskeleton with artificial muscles that acted in parallel with hamstrings and iliopsoas muscles. they walked at a speed of approximately 1m/s along the walkway under four experimental conditions: normal walking (nw), hamstrings contracture emulation (ham), iliopsoas contracture emulation (ips) and emulation of both hamstrings and iliopsoas contractures (ipsham). reflective markers and force platform data were collected and ankle, knee and hip-joint angles, moments and powers were calculated. ham and ipsham shifted ankle-angle rotation profiles into dorsiflexion during midstance compared to ips and nw where ankle-angle trajectories were similar. ham, ips and ipsham shifted the knee angle of rotation profiles into flexion during stance, compared to nw. ips and ipsham shifted hip angle of rotation profiles toward pronounced flexion while ham shifted hip angle of rotation profile toward extension, compared to nw. ham and ipsham significantly increased ankle moment during midstance, compared to ips and nw where ankle moment profiles were similar. all experimental conditions exhibited similar behavior in the knee-moment profiles during midstance while ips and ipsham knee-moment profiles exhibited significantly higher knee-extension moment during terminal stance and pre-swing. in the hip joint all experimental conditions exhibited similar shape of hip moment profiles throughout the gait cycle. ham and ips kinematic and kinetic patterns were qualitatively compared to two selected clinical cases, showing considerable similarity. this implies that distinct differences in kinematics and kinetics between ham, ips and ipsham may be clinically relevant in helping determine the relative contribution of hamstrings and iliopsoas muscles contractures to particular crouch walking.
mutation signatures implicate aristolochic acid in bladder cancer development all cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. the catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the apobec family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in dna maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. in addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, ‘kataegis’, is found in many cancer types. the results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.
the effect of allicin on blood and tissue lead content in mice the very young are more prone to lead poisoning than adults, and the treatment with chelating agents, either as monotherapy or combined treatment, is still a matter of dispute. the purpose of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of three chelating agents administered either as monotherapies or as combined treatments in sucklings. lead acetate (5 mg pb kg−1 i.p.) was administered to the 7‐day‐old rat pups in eight litters on experimental day 1 and chelating agents on experimental days 2 and 3. pups were divided into six groups: (1) untreated control; (2) edta (calcium disodium ethylendiaminetetraacetate, 0.3 mmol kg−1 i.p. at 4 p.m.); (3) meso‐dmsa (meso‐2,3‐dimeracaptosuccinic acid, 0.5 mmol kg−1 p.o. at 10 a.m.); (4) rac‐dmsa (racemic‐2,3‐dimeracaptosuccinic acid, 0.5 mmol kg−1 p.o. at 10 a.m.); (5) edta+meso‐dmsa; and (6) edta+rac‐dmsa. rats were killed on experimental day 5. tissue element concentrations were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. treatment with edta did not affect tissue pb, but it reduced zn in the carcass and liver. meso‐dmsa reduced pb in the kidneys and brain, and it did not affect organ essential elements. rac‐dmsa most efficiently reduced pb concentrations in the carcass, kidneys and brain, but it also reduced zn and cu in the liver and zn in the kidneys. combined treatments with edta never improved the efficiency of either dmsa isoform in decreasing tissue pb but they did reduce tissue zn concentrations. all treatments caused the same decrease in the carcass ca concentrations. the results do not support combined treatment in this age group, which is especially sensitive to trace element deficiencies, and suggest that meso‐dmsa might be the treatment of choice in acute lead poisoning in infants. copyright © 1999 john wiley & sons, ltd.
prospective study of shoulder strength, shoulder range of motion, and lymphedema in breast cancer patients from pre-surgery to 5 years after alnd or slnb background although numerous studies have shown that the status of the sentinel node is an accurate predictor of the status of the axillary nodes in breast cancer, the efficacy and safety of sentinel-node biopsy require validation.   methods from march 1998 to december 1999, we randomly assigned 516 patients with primary breast cancer in whom the tumor was less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter either to sentinel-node biopsy and total axillary dissection (the axillary-dissection group) or to sentinel-node biopsy followed by axillary dissection only if the sentinel node contained metastases (the sentinel-node group).   results the number of sentinel nodes found was the same in the two groups. a sentinel node was positive in 83 of the 257 patients in the axillary-dissection group (32.3 percent), and in 92 of the 259 patients in the sentinel-node group (35.5 percent). in the axillary-dissection group, the overall accuracy of the sentinel-node status was 96.9 percent, the sensitivity 91.2 percent, and the specificity 100 percent. there was less pain and better arm mobility in the patients who underwent sentinel-node biopsy only than in those who also underwent axillary dissection. there were 15 events associated with breast cancer in the axillary-dissection group and 10 such events in the sentinel-node group. among the 167 patients who did not undergo axillary dissection, there were no cases of overt axillary metastasis during follow-up.   conclusions sentinel-node biopsy is a safe and accurate method of screening the axillary nodes for metastasis in women with a small breast cancer.
does nurses' health affect their intention to remain in their current position? backgroundprevious studies on self-rated health among nurses have indicated an association of low job satisfaction and stress in relation to poor self-rated health. the relationship between self rated health and the specific work characteristics and health related behaviours of nurses to our knowledge have not been adequately studied.objectiveto investigate the health profile of nurses working in hospitals in north west greece and to examine the associations between self rated health (srh) and health related behaviours and work characteristics in this group of hospital employees.methodsa self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 443 nurses working in all the hospitals in north west greece. regression analysis was used to examine the relationship of health related behaviours and work characteristics with self rated health among the nurses.resultsa total of 353 responded to the questionnaire (response rate 80%) of which 311 (88%) were female and 42 (12%) male. the mean age (standard deviation) of the respondents was 36 years (5.6) and their mean years of working as nurses were 13.5 years (5.9). almost half of the nurses' smoked, and about one third were overweight or obese. about 58% (206) of the nurses reported having poor health while 42% (147) reported having good health. self-rated health was independently associated with gender, effort to avoid fatty foods and physical activity, according to multiple logistic regression analysis.conclusionthe population studied presented a relatively poor health profile, and a high proportion of poor srh. though female gender and effort to avoid fatty foods were associated with poor srh, and exercise and white meat consumption with good srh, specific work characteristics were not associated with srh.
distal nerve transfer versus supraclavicular nerve grafting: comparison of elbow flexion outcome in neonatal brachial plexus palsy with c5-c7 involvement summary: obstetrical brachial plexus palsy is commonly attributed to excessive traction applied to the baby’s neck during a difficult delivery. the majority of infants with brachial plexus palsy recover spontaneously within the first 3 months of life. however, in 10 to 30 percent of cases, the recovery is incomplete. global palsy and the absence of biceps muscle function at 3 months of age have been adopted as the main indications for early brachial plexus microsurgery. in late cases or when primary reconstruction has not yielded satisfactory results, secondary reconstruction will intervene as an enhancement of a specific functional deficit or of the overall function of the upper extremity. in this article, the authors review the history of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy, the epidemiology and cause, and the indications for and the timing of surgery. the current diagnostic modalities and clinical evaluation of plexus injuries are also considered. the advances in electrophysiology, myelography, and computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging are presented, all of which are important diagnostic modalities that facilitate a more accurate diagnosis. obstetrical brachial plexus injuries may require multistaged reconstructive procedures, including neurolysis, resection of neuromas, identification of intraplexus and extraplexus donor nerves, selective neurotizations, selective nerve transfers, and nerve grafting. finally, the various secondary procedures in terms of anatomical location in the upper extremity are described. whatever the reports and results, the complex doctrine of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy continues to evolve with notable functional outcomes, but return to normal function remains a challenge for the future.
synaesthetic colour embedded shapes , but without pre-attentive ' popout ' of grapheme-colour synaesthesia improves detection of supplementary data grapheme-color synesthetes experience specific colors associated with specific number or letter characters. to determine the neural locus of this condition, we compared behavioral and fmri responses in six grapheme-color synesthetes to control subjects. in our behavioral experiments, we found that a subject's synesthetic experience can aid in texture segregation (experiment 1) and reduce the effects of crowding (experiment 2). for synesthetes, graphemes produced larger fmri responses in color-selective area human v4 than for control subjects (experiment 3). importantly, we found a correlation within subjects between the behavioral and fmri results; subjects with better performance on the behavioral experiments showed larger fmri responses in early retinotopic visual areas (v1, v2, v3, and hv4). these results suggest that grapheme-color synesthesia is the result of cross-activation between grapheme-selective and color-selective brain areas. the correlation between the behavioral and fmri results suggests that grapheme-color synesthetes may constitute a heterogeneous group.
prophylactic phenylephrine infusion for the prevention of hypotension after spinal anesthesia in the elderly: a randomized controlled clinical trial. unlabelled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we evaluated the effect of prophylactic im phenylephrine at doses of 1.5 and 3 mg on hyperbaric tetracaine spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in 90 normotensive and hypertensive patients aged >65 yr undergoing surgery for hip fracture. thirty normotensive patients received 1.5 or 3 mg of phenylephrine im (n/p-1.5 and n/p-3.0 groups; n = 15 in each), whereas controls received saline (n/c group; n = 15), and 45 hypertensive patients were treated in a similar manner (h/p-1.5, h/p-3.0, and h/c groups; n = 15 in each). all groups had a peak sensory block height of t9, with a range of t8 to t10. the incidence of hypotension (>25% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure [map] from baseline) was significantly lower in the patients who received phenylephrine 1.5 or 3 mg than in the controls, both in the normotensive and hypertensive groups (p < 0.01). the n/p-3.0 and n/p-1.5 groups and the h/p-3.0 group had significantly lower percentage reductions in map (p < 0.05) and required significantly smaller doses of rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05) than did the n/c group or the h/c group. the h/p-1.5 group also required significantly less rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05), although it was not sufficient to significantly attenuate the percentage decrease in map compared with that in the h/c group. bradycardia (heart rate <50 bpm) as an adverse effect after im administration of phenylephrine was not observed in any of the groups. hypertension (map >20% increase from baseline) after medication occurred in the n/p-3.0 and h/p-3.0 groups, but not in the n/p-1.5 and h/p-1.5 groups. we conclude that prophylactic im injection of 1.5 mg of phenylephrine is a safe (defined as the inhibition of bradycardia and hypertension) and effective means of reducing the incidence of hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients.   implications we evaluated the efficacy and safety of small-dose im phenylephrine for prophylaxis against spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients. phenylephrine 1.5 mg im was effective for reducing the incidence of hypotension and avoided adverse effects.
an epidemiological study on the prevalence of temporomandibular disorder and associated history and problems in nepalese subjects purpose several clinical studies suggest that psychologic factors may play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of temporomandibular disorder (tmd) signs and symptoms. the goal of this study was to verify the prevalence of anxiety and depression in adolescents, and their relationship with signs and symptoms of tmd.   materials and methods the sample comprised 217 nonpatient adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. the subjective symptoms and clinical signs of tmd were evaluated, respectively, using a self-report questionnaire and the craniomandibular index (cmi, which has 2 subscales), the dysfunction index, and the palpation index. the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), a 14-item self-administered rating scale that was developed specifically to identify anxiety and depression in nonpsychiatric medical outpatients, assessed levels of anxiety and depression.   results in the total sample, anxiety and depression were present in 16.58% and 26.71% of subjects, respectively, including all levels of hads. the results showed that there were positive correlations between cmi and palpation index and anxiety (hadsa) (p < .01) but not with depression (hadsd). an association between the number of tmd subjective symptoms and hadsa/hadsd was found (p < .01).   conclusion anxiety and depression, although of mild intensity, are common in adolescents. in this study both hadsa and hadsd were associated with an increasing number of tmd subjective symptoms. however, only anxiety was correlated with clinical signs of tmd (cmi), primarily muscle tenderness (palpation index).
a 3d difference-of-gaussian-based lesion detector for brain pet pattern classification methods have been widely studied for analysis of brain images to decode the disease states, such as diagnosis of alzheimer's disease (ad). most existing methods aimed to extract discriminative features from neuroimaging data and then build a supervised classifier for classification. however, due to the rich imaging features and small sample size of neuroimaging data, it is still challenging to make use of features to achieve good classification performance. in this paper, we propose a hierarchical ensemble classification algorithm to gradually combine the features and decisions into a unified model for more accurate classification. specifically, a number of low-level classifiers are first built to transform the rich imaging and correlation-context features of brain image into more compact high-level features with supervised learning. then, multiple high-level classifiers are generated, with each evaluating the high-level features of different brain regions. finally, all high-level classifiers are combined to make final decision. our method is evaluated using mr brain images on 427 subjects (including 198 ad patients and 229 normal controls) from alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (adni) database. experimental results show that our method achieves an accuracy of 92.04% and an auc (area under the roc curve) of 0.9518 for ad classification, demonstrating very promising classification performance.
cadmium chloride-induced testicular toxicity in male wistar rats; prophylactic effect of quercetin, and assessment of testicular recovery following cadmium chloride withdrawal. although it is well known that cadmium (cd) causes adverse effects on male rat reproductive organs, few studies have quantified alterations caused by its low doses. quantification of these alterations, especially in the testis, was measured using morphometry. a single dose of cadmium chloride (1 or 1.2 mg/kg bw) was injected i.p. in adult rats, killed after 7 or 56 days. the lower dose caused slight alterations as measured by morphometrical analysis. the higher dose caused significant reduction in testis and epididymis weight, gonadossomatic index and length of seminiferous tubule (st) after 7 and 56 days. cadmium significantly reduced the st diameter after 56 days. decreased volume density of st, after 7 and 56 days, was accompanied by an increase in interstitium volume density. the damage caused by the dose of 1.2 mg/kg can be clearly observed with light microscope. after 7 days, the tubule lumens were filled with degenerated germ cells and multinucleated spermatid aggregates. vacuolization of the seminiferous epithelium was also observed. after 56 days, increased damage resulted in vacuolated st, consisting only of sertoli cells. scanning electron microscopy examination of the testis showed that, in the group cadmium treated (1.2 mg/kg) and killed after 56 days, the interstitial tissue presents a compact and fibrous appearance with absence of fenestrae. the seminiferous epithelium height diminished and the absence of spermatozoa can be noted. the results show that a very small difference of cd dose causes a sudden increase in testicular damage, apparently overpowering this tissue’s natural defences.
release of sulphate-sulphur, potassium, calcium and magnesium from spent mushroom compost under field conditions abstract the release of sulphate-sulphur (so42–-s), potassium (k), calcium (ca) and magnesium (mg) from soil amended with spent mushroom compost (smc), a by-product of mushroom production, was measured for 16 weeks in an open laboratory incubation at 25°c. rates of application were up to 80 t ha–1 moist smc (0.84% smc dry weight) both with and without inorganic fertilizer. the rates of nutrient application in the inorganic fertilizer were: 338 kg ha–1 n, 100 kg ha–1 of both phosphorus and k, and 114 kg ha–1 s. smc contains 1.7% k, 6.5% ca, 0.4% mg and 1.2% s (of which 87% is inorganic), and has a carbon:sulphur ratio of 26. the release of so42–-s was rapid, and was described using either a first or mixed order exponential equation, or (underestimated) by the century model. the release of k, ca and mg was initially rapid (first order) and then declined to a constant rate (zero order). their release was also described using first/first order or first order/parabolic diffusion equations. model parameters indicated the relative sizes of both readily releasable and recalcitrant nutrient pools. the recovery of smc-supplied nutrients in the absence of fertilizer was 75–83% of the s, 40–45% of the k, 14–20% of the ca and 43–66% of the mg. when fertilizer was applied 33–45% of the s, 22–36% of the k, 12–24% of the ca and –4 to 20% of the mg that were supplied by the smc and fertilizer were recovered in the leachate. the generally lower nutrient recovery when fertilizer was applied could have resulted from the incomplete recovery of fertilizer s and k, from soil fixation of applied nutrients, and from the lower ph following fertilizer application.
expression levels and clinical significance of mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in this study, we report for the first time reduced expression of the let-7 microrna in human lung cancers. interestingly, 143 lung cancer cases that had undergone potentially curative resection could be classified into two major groups according to let-7 expression in unsupervised hierarchical analysis, showing significantly shorter survival after potentially curative resection in cases with reduced let-7 expression (p = 0.0003). multivariate cox regression analysis showed this prognostic impact to be independent of disease stage (hazard ratio = 2.17; p = 0.009). in addition, overexpression of let-7 in a549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line inhibited lung cancer cell growth in vitro. this study represents the first report of reduced expression of let-7 and the potential clinical and biological effects of such a microrna alteration.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
accuracy of 50‐g glucose challenge test to detect international association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups criteria‐defined hyperglycemia background a 50-g oral glucose challenge test (ogct) is a widely accepted screening method for gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), but other options are being considered.   purpose to systematically review the test characteristics of various screening methods for gdm across a range of recommended diagnostic glucose thresholds.   data sources 15 electronic databases from 1995 to may 2012, reference lists, web sites of relevant organizations, and gray literature.   study selection two reviewers independently identified english-language prospective studies that compared any screening test for gdm with any reference standard.   data extraction one reviewer extracted and a second reviewer verified data from 51 cohort studies. two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality.   data synthesis the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for the ogct at a threshold of 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) were 70% to 88%, 69% to 89%, 2.6 to 6.5, and 0.16 to 0.33, respectively. at a threshold of 7.2 mmol/l (130 mg/dl), the test characteristics were 88% to 99%, 66% to 77%, 2.7 to 4.2, and 0.02 to 0.14, respectively. for a fasting plasma glucose threshold of 4.7 mmol/l (85 mg/dl), they were 87%, 52%, 1.8, and 0.25, respectively. glycated hemoglobin level had poorer test characteristics than fasting plasma glucose level or the ogct. no studies compared the ogct with international association of the diabetes and pregnancy study groups (iadpsg) diagnostic criteria.   limitations the lack of a gold standard for confirming gdm limits comparisons. few data exist for screening tests before 24 weeks' gestation.   conclusion the ogct and fasting plasma glucose level (at a threshold of 4.7 mmol/l [85 mg/dl]) by 24 weeks' gestation are good at identifying women who do not have gdm. the ogct is better at identifying women who have gdm. the ogct has not been validated for the iadpsg diagnostic criteria.

anacamptis versus orchis (orchidaceae): seed micromorphology and its taxonomic significance turtles are one of earth's most instantly recognizable life forms, distinguished for over 200 million years in the fossil record. even so, key nodes in the phylogeny of turtles remain uncertain. to address this issue, we sequenced >90% of the nuclear recombination activase gene 1 (rag-1) for 24 species representing all modern turtle families. rag-1 exhibited negligible saturation and base composition bias, and extensive base composition homogeneity. most of the relationships suggested by prior phylogenetic analyses were also supported by rag-1 and, for at least two critical nodes, with a much higher level of support. rag-1 also indicates that the enigmatic platysternidae and chelydridae, often considered sister taxa based on morphological evidence, are not closely related, although their precise phylogenetic placement in the turtle tree is still unresolved. although rag-1 is phylogenetically informative, our research revealed fundamental conflicts among analytical methods for estimating phylogenetic hypotheses. maximum parsimony analyses of rag-1 alone and in combination with two mitochondrial genes suggest the earliest phylogenetic splits separating into three basal branches, the pig-nosed turtles (carettochelyidae), the softshell turtles (trionychidae), and a clade comprising all remaining extant turtles. maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses group carettochelyidae and trionychidae (=trionychoidae) in their more traditional location as the sister taxon to all other hidden-necked turtles, collectively forming the cryptodira. our research highlights the utility of molecular data in identifying issues of character homology in morphological datasets, while shedding valuable light on the biodiversity of a globally imperiled taxon.
comparative analysis of espf variants in inhibition of escherichia coli phagocytosis by macrophages and inhibition of e. coli translocation through human- and bovine-derived m cells the epithelium that lines the gut is impermeable to macromolecules and microorganisms, except in peyer's patches (pps), where the lymphoid follicle-associated epithelium (fae) contains m cells that transport antigens and microorganisms. a cultured system that reproduces the main characteristics of fae and m cells was established by cultivation of pp lymphocytes with the differentiated human intestinal cell line caco-2. lymphocytes settled into the epithelial monolayer, inducing reorganization of the brush border and a temperature-dependent transport of particles and vibrio cholerae. this model system could prove useful for intestinal physiology, vaccine research, and drug delivery studies.
the effects of a 3-month controlled hiking programme on the functional abilities of patients following total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized trial objective to study the validity and feasibility of a computerized version of the western ontario and mcmaster universities (womac) osteoarthritis index.   methods thirty patients with osteoarthritis (oa) of the knee completed both a paper and a computerized version of womac in random order. the visual analog scaled version of womac, va3.0, was used. we studied criterion validity by comparing the paper and computerized versions.   results all patients completed the computerized version without undue difficulty. criterion validity, based on aggregated subscale scores, was excellent: pain, icc = 0.89, stiffness, icc = 0.87, physical function, icc = 0.95.   conclusion the computerized version of womac va3.0 is a valid alternative to the paper version.
social network analysis of peer effects on binge drinking among u.s. adolescents objective similarity in alcohol consumption among adolescent friends could be caused by the influence of friends or by the selection of friends who consume similar levels of alcohol. this article aims to disentangle influence and selection processes while specifically examining changes over time in these processes and possible differences between reciprocal and nonreciprocal friendships.   method the design was longitudinal with four observations (time 1-time 4 [t1-t4]). data consisted of a longitudinal sample of 1,204 finnish adolescents in 10 junior high schools. the main measurements were adolescents' friendship networks and alcohol consumption. for three successive periods, t1-t2, t2-t3, and t3-t4, actor-based models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior were analyzed (mage: t1 = 13.6 years, t2 = 14.6 years, t3 = 15.6 years, t4 = 16.1 years).   results selection, as well as influence processes, played an important role in adolescent alcohol consumption. influence was found during the first period (t1-t2), whereas support for selection was found during the last two periods (t2-t3 and t3-t4). the strength of influence and selection processes did not differ for reciprocal and nonreciprocal friendships.   conclusions the impact of selection and influence processes changed over time such that influence was only present during early adolescence, whereas selection was present during mid-adolescence. during early adolescence, youngsters would benefit from learning to resist social influence. alcohol-consumption prevention programs targeting mid-adolescence should consider peer selection processes. these findings stress the importance of considering changes over time in future practice and research.
risk factors for dsm 5 ptsd symptoms in israeli civilians during the gaza war background the impact on individual survivors of human rights abuses of testifying before south africa's truth and reconciliation commission (trc) has not been established.   aims to examine the degree to which participation in the trc is related to current psychiatric status and forgiveness among survivors.   method survivors (n=134) who gave public, closed or no testimony to the trc completed instruments measuring exposure to human rights abuses, exposure to other traumatic events, current psychiatric status and forgiveness attitudes towards the perpetrator(s).   results there was no significant association between trc participation and current psychiatric status or current forgiveness attitudes, and low forgiveness was associated with poorer psychiatric health.   conclusions truth commissions should form part of, rather than be a substitute for, comprehensive therapeutic interventions for survivors of human rights abuses. lack of forgiveness may be an important predictor of psychiatric risk in this population.
proteome changes in the small intestinal mucosa of growing pigs with dietary supplementation of non-starch polysaccharide enzymes enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) infection results in fluid and electrolyte losses in the small intestine. we investigated the effect of non-starch polysaccharides (nsp) hydrolysis products of wheat middlings (wm) and flaxseed (fs) on net absorption of fluid and solutes during etec challenge. products were generated by incubating wm and fs with a blend of carbohydrase enzymes to produce 2 products: 80% ethanol-soluble (es) and 80% ethanol-insoluble (ei) which were studied in 2 experiments in which 2 factors were investigated: products (ei vs. es) and time of etec challenge (before vs. after perfusion). pairs of small-intestine segments, one non-challenged and the other etec-challenged were perfused with products for 7.5 h. etec reduced fluid absorption by more than 380 microl/cm(2) in saline (control) perfused segments, whereas this reduction was significantly (p < 0.05) less for the wm and fs products. interaction (p > 0.05) between product and time of challenge was not observed. for wm, products effects on etec-challenged segments were such that perfusion of es resulted in higher total solute (measured as osmolality) absorption than ei (138 vs. 103 microosmol/cm(2)). in conclusion, hydrolysis products from wm and fs were beneficial in maintaining fluid balance during etec challenge, suggesting potential in controlling etec induced diarrhea in piglets.
can we predict the outcome of 595-nm wavelength pulsed dye laser therapy on capillary vascular malformations from the first beginning: a pilot study of efficacy co-related factors in 686 chinese patients forty-three children with 49 separate port-wine stain vascular malformations were treated with the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser at 585 nm. the patients ranged in age from 2 weeks to 14 years. overall, 16% of patients had more than 95% resolution of their port-wine stains after an average of 4.8 (1 to 11) treatments. there was an average improvement of 69% in those lesions not clearing completely (average of 3.7 treatments). lesions in patients less than 4 years of age were almost twice as likely to clear than were those in older children (20% vs 12%), and in fewer treatments (3.8 vs 6.5). an approximate 50% clearing was obtained with one treatment. subsequent treatments resulted in an additional 10% clearing. there were no episodes of scarring or persistent pigmentary changes in any of the patients. lesions on the hand and arm responded less well than lesions on the face, neck, and torso. the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser has proved to be a safe and effective treatment modality for port-wine stain capillary malformations in infants and children.
effect of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on infant neurodevelopment at 1 year of age. context thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development. limited data are available regarding whether thyroid function in neonates influences later cognitive development.   objective our objective was to study associations of newborn t4 levels with maternal thyroid function and childhood cognition.   design and setting we studied participants in project viva, a cohort study in massachusetts.   participants we studied a total of 500 children born 1999--2003 at 34 wk or more.   main outcome measures we determined cognitive test scores at ages 6 months and 3 yr.   results mean newborn t4 at a mean age of 1.94 d was 17.6 (sd 4.0) microg/dl, and levels were higher in girls [1.07 microg/dl; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.38, 1.76] and infants born after longer gestation (0.42 microg/dl; 95% ci 0.17, 0.67 per wk). newborn t4 levels were not associated with maternal t4, tsh, or thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. on multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, higher newborn t4 was unexpectedly associated with poorer scores on the visual recognition memory test among infants at age 6 months (-0.5; 95% ci -0.9, -0.2), but not with scores at age 3 yr on either the peabody picture vocabulary test (0.2; 95% ci -0.1, 0.5) or the wide range assessment of visual motor abilities (0.1; 95% ci -0.2, 0.3). maternal thyroid function test results were not associated with child cognitive test scores.   conclusions newborn t4 concentrations within a normal physiological reference range are not associated with maternal thyroid function and do not predict cognitive outcome in a population living in an iodine-sufficient area.
huaiqihuang granules (槐杞黄颗粒) reduce proteinuria by enhancing nephrin expression and regulating necrosis factor κb signaling pathway in adriamycin-induced nephropathy in this study, we investigated the synergistic effects of panobinostat and bortezomib on adriamycin-resistant hl60/adr cells and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) primary cells. combination of both agents had synergistic cytotoxicity on these cells, and increased the sensitivity of hl60/adr cells to adriamycin. panobinostat plus bortezomib was shown to modulate multiple apoptotic and drug metabolic related molecules, including activation of caspases, down-regulation of xiap, bcl-2 and mrp1. these effects were likely to be mediated via inhibition of akt and nf-κb pathways. these findings provide evidence for clinic protocols using panobinostat and borezomib to overcome drug resistance in refractory aml patients.
il-6 promoter polymorphism (−174g/c) and systemic lupus erythematosus autoreactive b cells and plasma cells appear to be of central importance in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) characterized by a plethora of autoantibodies. recent insights into abnormalities of b cell and plasma cell compartments in human sle have identified a number of cellular disturbances within these compartments that in part correlate with the disease activity. this review discusses these findings and the potential underlying extrinsic and/or intrinsic influences apparently driving general b cell activation in this entity.
effects of halothane on the electroencephalogram of the chicken methodology for assessment of depth of anaesthesia based on analysis of the electroencephalogram (eeg) is controversial. techniques range from display of single measures, for example median value of the frequency spectrum, to dedicated pattern recognition systems based on measures of several eeg features. we have compared the performance of four techniques using tape-recorded data from 23 patients anaesthetized with either halothane or isoflurane using standardized regimens. the techniques were: (1) median frequency, (2) spectral edge frequency, (3) the cerebral function analysing monitor (cfam1) and (4) a depth of anaesthesia monitor based on eeg pattern recognition (adam). dose-response curves are presented for stepwise increases in stable end-tidal concentrations of each agent. results indicated considerable inter-patient variability and the limitations of single eeg measures, particularly with deeper anaesthesia producing a burst suppression pattern in the eeg. pattern recognition techniques reduced these difficulties and appeared to be promising over a wide range of anaesthetic levels.
gene expression variation between distinct areas of breast cancer measured from paraffin-embedded tissue cores although distinct pathological stages of breast cancer have been described, the molecular differences among these stages are largely unknown. here, through the combined use of laser capture microdissection and dna microarrays, we have generated in situ gene expression profiles of the premalignant, preinvasive, and invasive stages of human breast cancer. our data reveal extensive similarities at the transcriptome level among the distinct stages of progression and suggest that gene expression alterations conferring the potential for invasive growth are already present in the preinvasive stages. in contrast to tumor stage, different tumor grades are associated with distinct gene expression signatures. furthermore, a subset of genes associated with high tumor grade is quantitatively correlated with the transition from preinvasive to invasive growth.
motor imagery as a function of disease severity in multiple sclerosis: an fmri study background movement-associated cortical reorganisation is known to occur in multiple sclerosis (ms). we aimed to define the development of such cortical reorganisation by comparing data from patients with different disease phenotypes.   methods we studied patients with different phenotypes of ms: 16 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (cis), 14 patients with relapsing-remitting ms (rrms) and no disability, 15 patients with rrms and mild clinical disability, and 12 patients with secondary progressive ms (spms). patients did a simple motor task with their unimpaired dominant hand during mri, which was compared across the phenotype groups.   findings patients with a cis activated more of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex than those with rrms and no disability, whereas patients with rrms and no disability activated more of the supplementary motor area than those with a cis. patients with rrms and no disability activated more of the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally, and more of the ipsilateral supplementary motor area than patients with rrms and mild clinical disability. conversely, patients with rrms and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, and the ipsilateral precuneus. patients with rrms and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral thalamus and of the ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex than those with spms. however, patients with spms activated more of the inferior frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the middle frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the contralateral precuneus, and the ipsilateral cingulate motor area and inferior parietal lobule.   interpretation movement-associated cortical reorganisation in patients with ms seems to vary across individuals at different stages of disease. our study suggests that early in the disease course more areas typically devoted to motor tasks are recruited. then bilateral activation of these regions is seen, and late in the disease course, areas that healthy people recruit to do novel or complex tasks are activated.
increased expression of glutamate transporters in subcortical white matter after transient focal cerebral ischemia since it has been suggested that microglia in vivo act as glutamate scavengers, this possibility was investigated in primary cultured microglia. the microglia showed specific abilities to uptake (14)c-glutamate depending on incubation time and numbers of cells used. the activity was suppressed by a specific inhibitor for a glial cell-type transporter, glutamate transporter-1 (glt-1) (eaat2). however, that of cultured astrocytes was not affected. these results suggest that microglia uptake glutamate by means of glt-1. supporting these results, immunoblotting revealed the presence of glt-1 in the microglia, while only glutamate-aspartate transporter (glast) (eaat1: another glial cell-type transporter) was detected in the astrocytes. all together, these results indicate that microglia can act as glutamate scavengers in vivo by expressing the glutamate transporter glt-1.
morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae in children born with non-syndromic cleft lip and / or palate compared with children without cleft objective: to investigate anatomical variations and abnormalities of cervical spine morphology in unoperated infants with cleft lip and palate. design: retrospective cross-sectional investigation of infants born with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate using computed tomography scans acquired for investigation of a spectrum of clinical conditions. setting: computed tomography scan data were obtained from 29 unoperated cleft lip and palate infants and 12 noncleft infants of malay origin, ages 0 to 12 months. methods: observational study of cervical spine computed tomography scans. heights of cervical vertebral bodies (c2-c7) and intervertebral spaces were measured from landmarks identified from computed tomography reformats and three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions. linear modeling of heights and spaces, with age as a covariate, was undertaken to identify differences between the samples. results: anomalous features observed in the cleft lip and palate sample included short posterior arch of c1 (2/29), abnormal development of the anterior arch of c1 (2/29), and fusions of the posterior arch of c2 and c3 (2/29). no anomalies of the cervical spine were observed in the noncleft sample. although the heights of three cervical vertebral bodies were significantly smaller and two intervertebral spaces were significantly larger in infants with cleft lip and palate compared with noncleft infants (p < .05), overall length of the cervical spine did not differ significantly between the samples. conclusion: there was evidence for subtle upper spinal anomalies in the infant cleft lip and palate population. our finding of reduced size of some cervical vertebral bodies may reflect delayed upper spinal development in infants with cleft lip and palate.
fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah) regulates hypercapnia/ischemia‐induced increases in n‐acylethanolamines in mouse brain the field of lipidomics has evolved vastly since its creation 15 years ago. advancements in mass spectrometry have allowed for the identification of hundreds of intact lipids and lipid mediators. however, because of the release of fatty acids from the phospholipid membrane in the brain caused by ischemia, identifying the neurolipidome has been challenging. microwave fixation has been shown to reduce the ischemia‐induced release of several lipid mediators. therefore, this study aimed to develop a method combining high‐resolution tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms), high‐energy head‐focused microwave fixation and statistical modeling, allowing for the measurement of intact lipids and lipid mediators in order to eliminate the ischemia‐induced release of fatty acids and identify the rat neurolipidome. in this study, we demonstrated the ischemia‐induced production of bioactive lipid mediators, and the reduction in variability using microwave fixation in combination with liquid chromatography (lc)–ms/ms. we have also illustrated for the first time that microwave fixation eliminates the alterations in intact lipid species following ischemia. while many phospholipid species were unchanged by ischemia, other intact lipid classes, such as diacylglycerol, were lower in concentration following microwave fixation compared to ischemia.
short-term effect of antibiotics on human gut microbiota mucosal tolerance has been considered a potentially important pathway for the treatment of autoimmune disease, including human multiple sclerosis and experimental conditions such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae). there is limited information on the capacity of commensal gut bacteria to induce and maintain peripheral immune tolerance. inbred sjl and c57bl/6 mice were treated orally with a broad spectrum of antibiotics to reduce gut microflora. reduction of gut commensal bacteria impaired the development of eae. intraperitoneal antibiotic-treated mice showed no significant decline in the gut microflora and developed eae similar to untreated mice, suggesting that reduction in disease activity was related to alterations in the gut bacterial population. protection was associated with a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and increases in il-10 and il-13. adoptive transfer of low numbers of il-10-producing cd25+cd4+ t cells (>75% foxp3+) purified from cervical lymph nodes of commensal bacteria reduced mice and in vivo neutralization of cd25+ cells suggested the role of regulatory t cells maintaining peripheral immune homeostasis. our data demonstrate that antibiotic modification of gut commensal bacteria can modulate peripheral immune tolerance that can protect against eae. this approach may offer a new therapeutic paradigm in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and perhaps other autoimmune conditions.
formal verification of c systems code structured types, separation logic and theorem proving we present a formal model of memory that both captures the low-level features of c's pointers and memory, and that forms the basis for an expressive implementation of separation logic. at the low level, we do not commit common oversimplifications, but correctly deal with c's model of programming language values and the heap. at the level of separation logic, we are still able to reason abstractly and efficiently. we implement this framework in the theorem prover isabelle/hol and demonstrate it on two case studies. we show that the divide between detailed and abstract does not impose undue verification overhead, and that simple programs remain easy to verify. we also show that the framework is applicable to real, security- and safety-critical code by formally verifying the memory allocator of the l4 microkernel.
secretion of stress protein grp170 promotes immune-mediated inhibition of murine prostate tumor abstract. several studies have suggested a positive correlation between heat shock protein (hsp) expression and tumor immunogenicity. independently, many studies have shown that hsp purified from tumors can be used as a tumor-specific vaccine. in this study, we have explored the connection between hsp expression and anti-tumor immunity by transducing murine ct26 colon carcinoma cells with the cdna of a major hsp, i.e. hsp110. we have shown that over-expression of hsp110 has no effect on ct26 tumor cell growth in vitro, and does not inhibit their anchorage-independent growth capacity. however, in situ, hsp110 over-expressing ct26 tumor (ct26-hsp110) grew at a significantly reduced rate as compared to the wild-type ct26 tumor in immunocompetent mice. moreover, immunization of mice with inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells significantly inhibited the growth of wild-type ct26 tumor. this immunity was associated with an increased frequency of tumor-specific t cells after vaccination. an in vivo antibody depletion assay demonstrated that inactivated ct26-hsp110 cells elicited anti-tumor responses involving cd8+ t cells and natural killer (nk) cells, but not cd4+ t cells. lastly, the effect of the addition of granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm–csf) to these vaccine formulations was determined. mice immunized with irradiated ct26-hsp110 cells combined with gm–csf-producing bystander cells revealed a complete inhibition of ct26 tumor growth, indicating a synergy between inactivated ct26-hsp110 vaccine activity and gm–csf. these observations demonstrate that manipulation of hsp110 expression in tumors, specifically when combined with gm–csf, represents a potentially powerful approach to cancer vaccine formulation.
genetic expression profiles during physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in rats. objectives brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) is a strong predictor of left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy (lvh) and dysfunction. however, our recent studies suggested that lvh is not necessarily associated with enhanced production of bnp in hypertension. this study aimed to clarify the relation of the characteristics of hypertrophy with the degree of gene expression of bnp in the developmental process of hypertensive heart failure. methods serial changes in lv geometry, histology and atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) and bnp mrna levels, were assessed in a hypertensive heart failure model using dahl salt-sensitive rats (n = 24). we further studied effects of α1-receptor antagonist (doxazosin: 1 mg/kg per day, n = 5) and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor (at1r) antagonist (candesartan cilexetil: 1 mg/kg per day, n = 5). results the bnp mrna level was not elevated at the compensatory hypertrophic stage when anp mrna level was elevated. bnp mrna level was increased with further progression of hypertrophy and development of fibrosis. at1r blockade prevented such fibrosis and further progression of hypertrophy with normalization of bnp mrna levels. compensatory hypertrophy was not suppressed; therefore, anp mrna level, although decreased, was still beyond the normal level. the α1-receptor blockade slightly attenuated lv hypertrophy with a slight decrease in anp mrna levels. lv fibrosis was not prevented, and the bnp mrna level was not decreased. conclusions bnp gene expression is not enhanced by initial compensatory hypertrophy, but is enhanced by lv fibrosis and late stage progression of hypertrophy dependent on at1r-mediated signaling pathway.
prevention options for positives: the effects of a health communication intervention for men who have sex with men living with hiv/aids context the efficacy of counseling to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and other sexually transmitted diseases (stds) has not been definitively shown.   objective to compare the effects of 2 interactive hiv/std counseling interventions with didactic prevention messages typical of current practice.   design multicenter randomized controlled trial (project respect), with participants assigned to 1 of 3 individual face-to-face interventions.   setting five public std clinics (baltimore, md; denver, colo; long beach, calif; newark, nj; and san francisco, calif) between july 1993 and september 1996.   participants a total of 5758 heterosexual, hiv-negative patients aged 14 years or older who came for std examinations.   interventions arm 1 received enhanced counseling, 4 interactive theory-based sessions. arm 2 received brief counseling, 2 interactive risk-reduction sessions. arms 3 and 4 each received 2 brief didactic messages typical of current care. arms 1, 2, and 3 were actively followed up after enrollment with questionnaires at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and std tests at 6 and 12 months. an intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare interventions.   main outcome measures self-reported condom use and new diagnoses of stds (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, hiv) defined by laboratory tests.   results at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, self-reported 100% condom use was higher (p<.05) in both the enhanced counseling and brief counseling arms compared with participants in the didactic messages arm. through the 6-month interval, 30% fewer participants had new stds in both the enhanced counseling (7.2%; p= .002) and brief counseling (7.3%; p= .005) arms compared with those in the didactic messages arm (10.4%). through the 12-month study, 20% fewer participants in each counseling intervention had new stds compared with those in the didactic messages arm (p = .008). consistently at each of the 5 study sites, std incidence was lower in the counseling intervention arms than in the didactic messages intervention arm. reduction of std was similar for men and women and greater for adolescents and persons with an std diagnosed at enrollment.   conclusions short counseling interventions using personalized risk reduction plans can increase condom use and prevent new stds. effective counseling can be conducted even in busy public clinics.
prophylactic phenylephrine infusion for the prevention of hypotension after spinal anesthesia in the elderly: a randomized controlled clinical trial. unlabelled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we evaluated the effect of prophylactic im phenylephrine at doses of 1.5 and 3 mg on hyperbaric tetracaine spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in 90 normotensive and hypertensive patients aged >65 yr undergoing surgery for hip fracture. thirty normotensive patients received 1.5 or 3 mg of phenylephrine im (n/p-1.5 and n/p-3.0 groups; n = 15 in each), whereas controls received saline (n/c group; n = 15), and 45 hypertensive patients were treated in a similar manner (h/p-1.5, h/p-3.0, and h/c groups; n = 15 in each). all groups had a peak sensory block height of t9, with a range of t8 to t10. the incidence of hypotension (>25% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure [map] from baseline) was significantly lower in the patients who received phenylephrine 1.5 or 3 mg than in the controls, both in the normotensive and hypertensive groups (p < 0.01). the n/p-3.0 and n/p-1.5 groups and the h/p-3.0 group had significantly lower percentage reductions in map (p < 0.05) and required significantly smaller doses of rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05) than did the n/c group or the h/c group. the h/p-1.5 group also required significantly less rescue iv ephedrine (p < 0.05), although it was not sufficient to significantly attenuate the percentage decrease in map compared with that in the h/c group. bradycardia (heart rate <50 bpm) as an adverse effect after im administration of phenylephrine was not observed in any of the groups. hypertension (map >20% increase from baseline) after medication occurred in the n/p-3.0 and h/p-3.0 groups, but not in the n/p-1.5 and h/p-1.5 groups. we conclude that prophylactic im injection of 1.5 mg of phenylephrine is a safe (defined as the inhibition of bradycardia and hypertension) and effective means of reducing the incidence of hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients.   implications we evaluated the efficacy and safety of small-dose im phenylephrine for prophylaxis against spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients. phenylephrine 1.5 mg im was effective for reducing the incidence of hypotension and avoided adverse effects.
il-6 promoter polymorphism (−174g/c) and systemic lupus erythematosus autoreactive b cells and plasma cells appear to be of central importance in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) characterized by a plethora of autoantibodies. recent insights into abnormalities of b cell and plasma cell compartments in human sle have identified a number of cellular disturbances within these compartments that in part correlate with the disease activity. this review discusses these findings and the potential underlying extrinsic and/or intrinsic influences apparently driving general b cell activation in this entity.
intra-amniotic infection/inflammation as a risk factor for subsequent ruptured membranes after clinically indicated amniocentesis in preterm labor objective our purpose was to determine risk factors predictive of preterm premature rupture of the membranes in women treated for preterm labor with intact membranes.   study design women with intact membranes participating in a national institute of child health and human development multicenter randomized trial of adjunctive antibiotic therapy for preterm labor (24 to 34 weeks) were studied (n = 275). after randomization, 22 women continued to have contractions and were delivered of their infants. the remaining 253 women whose contractions had ceased composed our study population. preterm premature rupture of the membranes was diagnosed if ruptured membranes occurred > or = 1 hour before the onset of recurrent preterm labor. as part of the study protocol, most women underwent amniocentesis on admission.   results preterm premature rupture of the membranes developed in 44% women (17.4%). women who had preterm premature rupture of the membranes were more likely to be black (p = 0.004), to be multiparous (p = 0.014), to have a history of abortion(s) (p = 0.001), to have had a preterm birth(s) (p = 0.036), to have early onset preterm labor (p = 0.04), to have more advanced cervical dilatation (p = 0.0001), to have one or more amniotic fluid markers suggestive of infection (p = 0.01, odds ratio 4.2), and to have positive amniotic fluid cultures (p = 0.0007, odds ratio 27). assignment to antibiotic therapy did not prevent preterm premature rupture of the membranes in the 253 women randomized or in the 16 women with a positive amniotic fluid marker(s) of infection.   conclusion black race, multiparity, a history of abortion or preterm birth, advanced dilatation, and a positive amniotic fluid marker(s) are associated with preterm premature rupture of the membranes in women with preterm labor. antibiotic treatment did not prevent preterm premature rupture of the membranes.
altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the yac128 transgenic mouse model of huntington disease the lifelong addition of neurons to the hippocampus is a remarkable form of structural plasticity, yet the molecular controls over proliferation, neuronal fate determination, survival, and maturation are poorly understood. expression of notch1 was found to change dynamically depending on the differentiation state of neural precursor cells. through the use of inducible gain- and loss-of-function of notch1 mice we show that this membrane receptor is essential to these distinct processes. we found in vivo that activated notch1 overexpression induces proliferation, whereas γ-secretase inhibition or genetic ablation of notch1 promotes cell cycle exit, indicating that the level of activated notch1 regulates the magnitude of neurogenesis from postnatal progenitor cells. abrogation of notch signaling in vivo or in vitro leads to a transition from neural stem or precursor cells to transit-amplifying cells or neurons. further, genetic notch1 manipulation modulates survival and dendritic morphology of newborn granule cells. these results provide evidence for the expansive prevalence of notch signaling in hippocampal morphogenesis and plasticity, suggesting that notch1 could be a target of diverse traumatic and environmental modulators of adult neurogenesis.
arbuscular mycorrhiza formation in cordate gametophytes of two ferns, angiopteris lygodiifolia and osmunda japonica many plant species are characterized by a life cycle with a long-lived, subterranean phase that is completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungal symbionts for fixed carbon. this type of life cycle is both phylogenetically and ecologically widespread and is found in diverse vascular plant lineages from the tropics to subalpine meadows. here we report on the molecular identities of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the autotrophic and underground mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of the ferns botrychium crenulatum and b. lanceolatum. we show that the glomus taxa found in the mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum are also found in conspecific and heterospecific photosynthetic neighboring plants. from our dna sequence data, we infer carbon flow from photosynthetic plants to mycoheterotrophic plants through shared glomalean fungal networks. finally, our phylogenetic analyses identify a major glomus clade that forms associations with mycoheterotrophic life cycle stages of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum.
amygdala projections to the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in the macaque: comparison with ventral striatal afferents the ventral striatum is the part of the striatum associated with reward and goal-directed behaviors, which are mediated in part by inputs from the amygdala. the ventral striatum is divided into 'shell' and 'core' subterritories which have different connectional, histochemical and pharmacological properties. behavioral studies also indicate that subterritories of the ventral striatum are differentially involved in specific goal-directed behaviors. the amygdala is a heterogeneous structure which has multiple nuclei involved in processing emotional information. while the existence of an amygdalostriatal pathway has long been established, the relationship between amygdaloid afferents and specific subterritories of the ventral striatum is not known. in this study we operationally defined the ventromedial striatum as the region receiving cortical inputs primarily from the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex. we placed retrograde tracer injections into subregions of the ventromedial striatum of macaques monkeys to determine the relative contribution of specific amygdaloid inputs to each region. calbindin-d28k immunostaining was used to further define the shell subterritory of the ventromedial striatum. based on these definitions, the amygdala innervates the entire ventromedial striatum, and has few to no inputs to the central striatum. the basal and accessory basal nuclei are the major source of input to the ventromedial striatum, innervating both the shell and ventromedial striatum outside the shell. however, a restricted portion of the dorsomedial shell receives few basal nucleus inputs. afferent inputs from the basal nucleus subdivisions are arranged such that the parvicellular subdivision projects mainly to the ventral shell and core, and the magnocellular subdivision targets the ventral shell and ventromedial putamen. in contrast, the intermediate subdivision of the basal nucleus projects broadly across the ventromedial striatum avoiding only the dorsomedial shell. the shell has a specific set of connections derived from the medial part of the central nucleus and periamygdaloid cortex. within the shell, the dorsomedial region is distinguished by additional inputs from the medial nucleus. the ventromedial caudate nucleus forms a unique transition zone with the shell, based on inputs from the periamygdaloid cortex. together, these results indicate that subterritories of the ventromedial striatum are differentially modulated by amygdaloid nuclei which play roles in processing olfactory, visual/gustatory, multimodal sensory, and 'drive'-related stimuli.
assessing global dietary habits: a comparison of national estimates from the fao and the global dietary database1234 study objective: this project determined to what extent data on diet and nutrition, which were collected in a non-uniform manner, could be harmonised and pooled for international and national comparison. design: direct comparisons of dietary data between studies were made using food balance sheets (fbs), household budget surveys (hbs), and individual dietary data (ids); comparisons were also made within countries. differences in study design and methodological approaches were taken into consideration. data from research projects from the following four world health organisation (who) countrywide integrated noncommunicable disease intervention (cindi) countries were included—canada, finland, poland, and spain. main results: fbs overestimated food consumption and nutrient intake compared to ids. results between hbs and ids were quite similar, except for fish, meat, pulses and vegetables, which were underestimated by hbs, and sugar and honey and cereals, which were overestimated. percentages of energy from fat, carbohydrates and proteins were higher when estimated from fbs, hbs, and ids respectively. conclusions: results suggest that estimations from these three sources of dietary data are difficult to compare because they are measuring different levels of dietary information. the understanding of their relations may be important in formulating and evaluating a nutrition policy.
potential of low dose leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulphonate) (lmtm) monotherapy for treatment of mild alzheimer’s disease: cohort analysis as modified primary outcome in a phase iii clinical trial background as tau aggregation pathology correlates with clinical dementia in alzheimer's disease (ad), a tau aggregation inhibitor (tai) could have therapeutic utility. methylthioninium (mt) acts as a selective tai in vitro and reduces tau pathology in transgenic mouse models.   objective to determine the minimum safe and effective dose of mt required to prevent disease progression on clinical and functional molecular imaging outcomes.   methods an exploratory double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial of mt (69, 138, and 228 mg/day) was conducted in 321 mild/moderate ad subjects. the primary outcome was change on the alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (adas-cog) at 24 weeks relative to baseline severity. effect of treatment on regional cerebral blood flow decline was determined in a sub-study in 135 subjects. after 24 weeks, subjects were re-consented to enter sequential 6- and 12-month blinded extension phases. registered with clinicaltrials.gov (nct00515333).   results at 24 weeks, there were significant treatment benefits in two independent populations at the 138 mg/day dose: in moderate subjects on the adas-cog scale (treatment effect: -5.42 units, corrected p = 0.047) and two other clinical scales; in mild subjects on the more sensitive regional cerebral blood flow measure (treatment effect: 1.97%, corrected p < 0.001). with continued treatment for 50 weeks, benefit was seen on the adas-cog scale in both mild and moderate subjects. the delivery of the highest dose was impaired due to dose-dependent dissolution and absorption limitations.   conclusion the minimum safe and effective daily mt dose is 138 mg and suggests that further study of mt is warranted in ad.
a phosphorylated phloretin derivative. synthesis and effect on intestinal na(+)-dependent phosphate absorption. we examined the effect of phosphonoformic acid (pfa) and phosphonoacetic acid (paa) upon na+-pi cotransport in brush-border membrane (bbm) from small gut of rat. both pfa and paa inhibited the na+ gradient-dependent uptake of 32pi by bbm vesicles (bbmv) prepared from intestinal mucosa but had no effect on na+-dependent uptakes of d-[3h]glucose, l-[3h]proline, or [14c]succinate. the uptake in the absence of na+ gradient, or uptake at equilibrium period (180 min), was not affected by pfa or by paa. a chemical analogue of pfa and paa, phosphonopropionic acid, had only a minor inhibitory effect and phenylphosphonic acid was inactive. neither pfa nor paa influenced the activity of rat intestinal bbm alkaline phosphatase. the bbmv from rat jejunum had a much higher capacity for na+ gradient-dependent uptake of 32pi than bbmv from duodenum or ileum. the inhibition of bbmv 32pi transport across rat jejunum by pfa is competitive. we suggest that pfa and paa are specific inhibitors of na+ gradient-dependent uptake of pi by bbmv from small intestinal mucosa and that they could serve as useful experimental tools for the studies of intestinal na+-pi cotransport.
methylation profiles of endometrioid and serous endometrial cancers. purpose: many investigators have reported that aneuploidy detected by flow cytometry is a useful prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer. laser scanning cytometry (lsc) is a technology similar to flow cytometry but is more feasible for clinical laboratory use. we evaluated the usefulness of dna ploidy detected by lsc as a prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer and investigated genetic and epigenetic factors related to aneuploidy. experimental design: endometrial cancer specimens from 106 patients were evaluated. the methylation status of cdh13, rassf1, sfrp1, sfrp2, sfrp4, sfrp5, p16, hmlh1, mgmt, apc, atm, and wif1 and mutations in the p53 and cdc4 genes were investigated. lsc was carried out to determine dna ploidy. fluorescence in situ hybridization was done with chromosome-specific centromeric probes to assess chromosomal instability. results: univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that p53 mutation and lack of cdh13 hypermethylation associated positively with aneuploidy. univariate analysis showed that aneuploidy, chromosomal instability, and lack of cdh13 hypermethylation as well as surgical stage were significantly predictive of death from endometrial cancer. furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that stage in combination with either dna aneuploidy or lack of cdh13 hypermethylation was an independent prognostic factor. conclusion: these results suggest that analysis of dna ploidy and methylation status of cdh13 may help predict clinical outcome in patients with endometrial cancer. prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm the validity of an individualized approach, including determination of tumor ploidy and methylation status of cdh13, to management of endometrial cancer patients.
the effect of progressive eccentric and concentric training on functional performance after autogenous hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomized controlled study. we report isokinetic results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon or hamstring graft from the literature analysis. the literature was defined from two search "textwords": isokinetic and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and from three databases: medline, pascal, and herasmus. two independent physicians (physical medicine and rehabilitation) carried out an analysis according to the french national accreditation and health evaluation agency recommendations. fifty-three studies were selected: 29 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft, 15 reported isokinetic results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring graft, and 9 studies compared the two surgical procedures. after discussing different bias and in reference to prospective randomised and comparative studies, the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft involves a knee extensors deficit during several months. the hamstring surgical procedure involves a less important knee extensor deficit (from 6 to 19 % against 8 to 21 %). knee sprain and intra-articular surgery involve a long-lasting knee extensors deficit. anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings graft involves a knee flexors deficit over several months. the patellar tendon surgical procedure involves a less important knee flexors deficit (from 1 to 15 % against 5 to 17 %). in reference to isokinetic parameters, no difference between the two surgical procedures (patellar tendon graft or hamstring graft) is shown after more than twenty-four post-surgical months.
combined mek and jak inhibition abrogates murine myeloproliferative neoplasm. activating mutations in the ras oncogene are not considered sufficient to induce abnormal cellular proliferation in the absence of cooperating oncogenes. we demonstrate that the conditional expression of an endogenous k-ras(g12d) allele in murine embryonic fibroblasts causes enhanced proliferation and partial transformation in the absence of further genetic abnormalities. interestingly, k-ras(g12d)-expressing fibroblasts demonstrate attenuation and altered regulation of canonical ras effector signaling pathways. widespread expression of endogenous k-ras(g12d) is not tolerated during embryonic development, and directed expression in the lung and gi tract induces preneoplastic epithelial hyperplasias. our results suggest that endogenous oncogenic ras is sufficient to initiate transformation by stimulating proliferation, while further genetic lesions may be necessary for progression to frank malignancy.
pleiotropic role for mycn in medulloblastoma. the patched (ptc) gene encodes a sonic hedgehog (shh) receptor and a tumor suppressor protein that is defective in basal cell nevus syndrome (bcns). functions of ptc were investigated by inactivating the mouse gene. mice homozygous for the ptc mutation died during embryogenesis and were found to have open and overgrown neural tubes. two shh target genes, ptc itself and gli, were derepressed in the ectoderm and mesoderm but not in the endoderm. shh targets that are, under normal conditions, transcribed ventrally were aberrantly expressed in dorsal and lateral neural tube cells. thus ptc appears to be essential for repression of genes that are locally activated by shh. mice heterozygous for the ptc mutation were larger than normal, and a subset of them developed hindlimb defects or cerebellar medulloblastomas, abnormalities also seen in bcns patients.
morphological and molecular diversity within algerian cowpea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp.) landraces patterns of phenotypic and phenetic variability in sixportuguese cultivars of chestnut (castanea sativa mill.) are evaluated. morphological characterisationwas based on the quantification of seventeen traits. varianceanalysis showed significant differences among cultivars, and cultivar× year for all the traits studied, and trees within cultivarsshowed also some significant differences for some of themorphological variables. a significant correlation was obtainedbetween length of the leaf blade and the percentage of unisexual andandrogynic inflorescence with the effective thermal index,accumulated rainfall from april to october and from july to october,or the accumulated temperature below seven during the dormant period.principal component and cluster analysis were performed to group thecultivars, according to their similarity coefficients. for molecularcharacterisation, 125 rapd and 157 issr polymorphic markers wereamplified using 28 and 7 primers respectively. high level ofcongruence among the two marker systems (r =90.5%) was obtained from comparison of pheneticsimilarities based on the percentage of shared fragments. issrmarkers revealed important advantages over rapds, due to a higheffective multiplex ratio (12.5 for issr compared with 2.2 forrapd analysis) and reproducibility. although morphological andmolecular results are comparable, slight differences are showed incluster analysis upgma dendrograms. molecular analysis explainedhomonym situations among 'martainha' and'longal' cultivars in portugal.
atp promotes cell survival via regulation of cytosolic [ca2+] and bcl-2/bax ratio in lung cancer cells. cholesterol-lowering statins have been shown to inhibit growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. epidemiological studies also indicate a chemopreventive effect of statins. we have investigated the effect of statins on akt/protein kinase b signaling. we found that atorvastatin decreased constitutive- and insulin-induced pakt in panc-1 and mia paca-2 cells. statins also inhibited pakt in combination with gemcitabine- and 5-fluorouracil, and sensitized cells to gemcitabine- and 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. in line with our previous data, it was found that the p2x7-purinergic receptor mediated the effects of statins in panc-1 and mia paca-2 cells. thus, experiments employing p2x7 sirna and inhibitors supported an involvement of p2x7. in capan-2 cells, which expressed p2x7 in low levels, statins did not reduce pakt levels nor did statins sensitize them to cytostatic drugs. however, statin inhibited the growth of capan-2 cells and this correlated to inhibition of nfkappab and raf/mek pathways. as shown previously, these latter effects can be explained by an inhibited protein prenylation. our data suggest that statins primarily target a functional p2x7-akt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. by targeting the p2x7-akt axis, statins can sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. our data are also in line with a role for p2x7 in the chemopreventive effect of statins on pancreatic cancer.
independent component analysis-based multimodal classification of alzheimer's disease versus healthy controls we present a novel method to extract classification features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) data collected at rest or during the performance of a task. by combining a two-level feature identification scheme with kernel principal component analysis (kpca) and fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (fld), we achieve high classification rates in discriminating healthy controls from patients with schizophrenia. experimental results using leave-one-out cross-validation show that features extracted from the default mode network (dmn) lead to a classification accuracy of over 90% in both data sets. moreover, using a majority vote method that uses multiple features, we achieve a classification accuracy of 98% in auditory oddball (aod) task and 93% in rest data. several components, including dmn, temporal, and medial visual regions, are consistently present in the set of features that yield high classification accuracy. the features we have extracted thus show promise to be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia. results also suggest that there may be different advantages to using resting fmri data or task fmri data.
predictors of the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and survival in congenital diaphragmatic hernia: a center's 10‐year experience to investigate whether the prediction of postnatal outcome of fetuses with isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia depends on the gestational age at assessment using the fetal observed to expected (o/e) lung area to head circumference ratio (lhr), by comparing the performance of the test at 22–23 weeks with that at 32–33 weeks of gestation.
combined effect of 24-epibrassinolide and salicylic acid mitigates lead (pb) toxicity by modulating various metabolites in brassica juncea l. seedlings the phenolics: anthocyanin (ath), sinapoyl esters and activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat), guaiacol peroxidase (pox), ascorbate peroxidase (apx), glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and glutathione reductase (gr), in red cabbage seedlings subjected to cu2+ stress were investigated. cu2+ at low doses (0.5 mm), increased the levels of ath and sinapoyl derivatives in red cabbage. high cu2+ concentration (2.5 mm) provoked oxidative stress and enhanced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) content in tissues. a lower level of tbars was correlated with high ath content. it seems that synthesis of these isoflavonoids is an effective strategy against reactive oxygen species (ros). the analysis of the antioxidant enzymes activity suggested that peroxidases were the most active enzymes in red cabbage seedlings exposed to cu2+ stress. it could results from the fact that phenolic compounds (phc), which could be also substrates for different peroxidases, were the first line of defence against metal stress.
measuring right ventricular function in the normal and hypertensive mouse hearts using admittance-derived pressure-volume loops. global assessment of both cardiac and arterial function is important for a meaningful interpretation of pathophysiological changes in animal models of cardiovascular disease. we simultaneously acquired left ventricular (lv) and aortic pressure and lv volume (v(lv)) in 17 open-chest anesthetized mice (26.7 +/- 3.2g) during steady-state (bl) and caval vein occlusion (vco) using a 1.4-fr dual-pressure conductance catheter and in a subgroup of eight animals during aortic occlusion (aoo). aortic flow was obtained from numerical differentiation of v(lv). aoo increased input impedance (z(in)) for the first two harmonics, increased characteristic impedance (0.025 +/- 0.007 to 0.040 +/- 0.011 mmhg x microl(-1) x s, p < 0.05), and shifted the minimum in z(in) from the third to the sixth harmonic. for all conditions, the z(in) could be well represented by a four-element windkessel model. the augmentation index increased from 116.7 +/- 7.8% to 145.9 +/- 19.5% (p < 0.01) as well as estimated pulse-wave velocity (3.50 +/- 0.94 to 5.95 +/- 1.62 m/s, p < 0.05) and arterial elastance (e(a), 4.46 +/- 1.62 to 6.02 +/- 1.43 mmhg/microl, p < 0.01). aoo altered the maximal slope (e(max), 3.23 +/- 1.02 to 5.53 +/- 1.53 mmhg/microl, p < 0.05) and intercept (-19.9 +/- 8.6 to 1.62 +/- 13.51 microl, p < 0.01) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation but not e(a)/e(max) (1.44 +/- 0.43 to 1.21 +/- 0.37, not significant). we conclude that simultaneous acquisition of z(in) and arterial function parameters in the mouse, based solely on conductance catheter measurements, is feasible. we obtained an anticipated response of z(in) and arterial function parameters following vco and aoo, demonstrating the sensitivity of the measuring technique to induced physiological alterations in murine hemodynamics.
granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution the distribution of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation was studied in control autopsy and temporal lobe epilepsy (tle) specimens. in control tissue, the granule cell somata were closely approximated and formed a narrow lamina with a distinct, regular border with the molecular layer. in 11 of 15 tle specimens, the granule cell somata were dispersed and formed a wider than normal granule cell layer. the granule cell somata extended into the molecular layer to varying extents, creating an irregular boundary between the lamina. the dispersed granule cells were frequently aligned in columns, and many of these neurons displayed elongated bipolar forms. the extent of granule cell dispersion appeared to be related to the amount of cell loss in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus. granule cell dispersion was not consistently associated with granule cell loss although 5 of the 11 specimens with granule cell dispersion also showed moderate to marked granule cell loss. the most common features in the histories of the tle cases with granule cell dispersion were severe febrile seizures or seizures associated with meningitis or encephalitis during the first 4 years of life. the dispersion of the granule cells suggests that there has been some alteration in the patterns of cell migration in a subpopulation of cases with severe tle. the resultant ectopic positions of the granule cells could lead to changes in both the afferent and efferent connections of these neurons and, thus, contribute to the altered circuitry of the hippocampal formation in tle.
investigating paraoxonase-1 gene q192r and l55m polymorphism in patients with renal cell cancer. oxidative modification of low‐density lipoprotein (ldl) enhances its uptake by macrophages in tissue culture and in vivo may underly the formation of arterial fatty streaks, the progenitors of atheroma. we investigated the possible protection which high‐density lipoprotein (hdl) affords against ldl oxidation. the formation of lipoperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances when ldl was incubated with copper ions was significantly decreased by hdl. the enzyme, paraoxonase (e.c. 3.1.8.1), purified from human hdl, had a similar effect and thus may be the component of hdl responsible for decreasing the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products.
clocking the social mind by identifying mental processes in the iat with electrical neuroimaging in order to investigate the systems underlying the automatic and controlled processes that support social attitudes, we conducted an fmri study that combined an implicit measure of race attitudes with the quadruple process model (quad model). a number of previous neural investigations have adopted the implicit association test (iat) to examine the automatic processes that contribute to social attitudes. application of the quad model builds on this previous research by permitting measures of distinct automatic and controlled processes that contribute to performance on the iat. the present research found that prejudiced attitudes of ingroup favoritism were associated with amygdala, medial and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex. in contrast, prejudiced attitudes of outgroup negativity were associated with caudate and left lateral orbitofrontal cortex. frontal regions found in previous neural research on the iat, such as anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and operculum were associated with detecting appropriate responses in situations in which they conflict with automatic associations. insula activity was associated with attitudes towards ingroup and outgroup members, as well as detecting appropriate behavior.
therapeutic potential of sh 2 domain-containing inositol-5 ′-phosphatase 1 ( ship 1 ) and ship 2 inhibition in cancer abstract phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) activation and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (pi-3,4-p2) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (pi-3,4,5-p3) lipids mediate growth factor signaling that leads to cell proliferation, migration, and survival. pi3k-dependent activation of akt is critical for myoblast differentiation induced by serum withdrawal, suggesting that in these cells pi3k signaling is activated in an unconventional manner. here we investigate the mechanisms by which pi3k signaling and akt are regulated during myogenesis. we report that pi-3,4-p2 and pi-3,4,5-p3 accumulated in the plasma membranes of serum-starved 3t3-l6 myoblasts due to de novo synthesis and increased lipid stability. surprisingly, only newly synthesized lipids were capable of activating akt. knockdown of the lipid phosphatase pten moderately increased pi3k lipids but significantly increased akt phosphorylation and promoted myoblast differentiation. knockdown of the lipid phosphatase ship2, on the other hand, dramatically increased the steady-state levels of pi-3,4,5-p3 but did not affect akt phosphorylation and increased apoptotic cell death. together, these results reveal the existence of two distinct pools of pi3k lipids in differentiating 3t3-l6 myoblasts: a pool of nascent lipids that is mainly dephosphorylated by pten and is capable of activating akt and promoting myoblast differentiation and a stable pool that is dephosphorylated by ship2 and is unable to activate akt.
karyotype diversity of four species of the incertae sedis group (characidae) from different hydrographic basins: analysis of agnors, cma3 and 18s rdna. a cytogenetic study was conducted on an astyanax eigenmanniorum population from the caetano stream (18° 44' 56" s/ 048° 18' 39" w) - in uberlândia, mg, brazil - showing a modal diploid number of 48 chromosomes in the standard male and female karyotypes. however, in several specimens it was also possible to observe metaphases with one or two b chromosomes, increasing the diploid number to 49 or 50 chromosomes, respectively. the supernumerary chromosomes were totally heterochromatic and highlighted after c-banding. the silver-stained nucleolus organizing regions (ag-nors) were located in at least five chromosomes of the standard karyotype, thus characterizing a multiple nor system in the species. this is the first occurrence of an a. eigenmanniorum population with 2n = 48 chromosomes, bearing supernumerary chromosomes.
worldwide topology of the scientific subject profile: a macro approach in the country level the inherited disciplinary structure of the science of post-communist countries of cee carries a strong common features of its past. the communist heritage is present in: a) a relatively homogeneous research profile among post-communist countries; b) the similar structure of disciplinary comparative advantages of post-communist countries; c) the unbalanced and concentrated disciplinary structure of comparative advantages. the analysis is based on isi databases and uses statistics on papers and citations for the 1992–1997 period for all central and eastern european countries as well as for other world regions. in the conclusions we discuss the relevance of the results for the restructuring of science in the countries of central and eastern europe.
effect of fur removal on the thermal conductance and energy budget in lactating swiss mice using lactation in mice as a model, we sought to determine whether ceilings on sustained energy expenditure reside in the capacities of energy-acquiring and input organs (such as the intestine) or of energy-expending and output organs (such as the mammary glands). to distinguish between these possibilities experimentally, we surgically varied the teat number of lactating mother mice while simultaneously varying their litter size. the energy burden on each teat (i.e. the pup/teat ratio) could thus be varied independently of the energy burden (i.e. litter size) on the mother herself or on her intestine. at each teat number, pup mass proved to be maximal at intermediate litter sizes. at a given pup/teat ratio, mothers with five teats weaned pups no larger than the pups of normal (10-teat) mothers, even though the total energy burden on the former mothers was only half as large. mothers with only two teats could not wean any pups. litter size controlled maternal food intake, which in turn controlled intestinal mass and nutrient uptake capacity. disproportionately high food intake for the smallest litters appears to reflect capital start-up costs of lactation. pup mass is evidently limited by inadequate suckling stimulation of mammary glands.
gambit: a parameterless model-based evolutionary algorithm for mixed-integer problems evolution strategies (ess) are powerful probabilistic search and optimization algorithms gleaned from biological evolution theory. they have been successfully applied to a wide range of real world applications. the modern ess are mainly designed for solving continuous parameter optimization problems. their ability to adapt the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution used for mutation during the optimization run makes them well suited for this domain. in this article we describe and study mixed integer evolution strategies (mies), which are natural extensions of es for mixed integer optimization problems. mies can deal with parameter vectors consisting not only of continuous variables but also with nominal discrete and integer variables. following the design principles of the canonical evolution strategies, they use specialized mutation operators tailored for the aforementioned mixed parameter classes. for each type of variable, the choice of mutation operators is governed by a natural metric for this variable type, maximal entropy, and symmetry considerations. all distributions used for mutation can be controlled in their shape by means of scaling parameters, allowing self-adaptation to be implemented. after introducing and motivating the conceptual design of the mies, we study the optimality of the self-adaptation of step sizes and mutation rates on a generalized (weighted) sphere model. moreover, we prove global convergence of the mies on a very general class of problems. the remainder of the article is devoted to performance studies on artificial landscapes (barrier functions and mixed integer nk landscapes), and a case study in the optimization of medical image analysis systems. in addition, we show that with proper constraint handling techniques, mies can also be applied to classical mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
childhood victimization and inflammation in young adulthood: a genetically sensitive cohort study to identify molecular mechanisms by which early life social conditions might influence adult risk of disease in rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta), we analyze changes in basal leukocyte gene expression profiles in 4-mo-old animals reared under adverse social conditions. compared with the basal condition of maternal rearing (mr), leukocytes from peer-reared (pr) animals and pr animals provided with an inanimate surrogate mother (surrogate/peer reared, spr) show enhanced expression of genes involved in inflammation, cytokine signaling, and t-lymphocyte activation, and suppression of genes involved in several innate antimicrobial defenses including type i interferon (ifn) antiviral responses. promoter-based bioinformatic analyses implicate increased activity of creb and nf-κb transcription factors and decreased activity of ifn response factors (irfs) in structuring the observed differences in gene expression. transcript origin analyses identify monocytes and cd4+ t lymphocytes as primary cellular mediators of transcriptional up-regulation and b lymphocytes as major sources of down-regulated genes. these findings show that adverse social conditions can become embedded within the basal transcriptome of primate immune cells within the first 4 mo of life, and they implicate sympathetic nervous system-linked transcription control pathways as candidate mediators of those effects and potential targets for health-protective intervention.
association studies in qtl regions linked to bovine trypanotolerance in a west african crossbred population. one hundred and forty six calving interval records were built up from 64 n'dama cows maintained for 3.5 years under a high natural tsetse challenge in zaire. matching health and performance data were recorded monthly to allow simultaneous evaluation of the effects of different criteria of trypanotolerance represented by time detected parasitaemic, parasitaemia score and packed red cell volume percent (pcv) on reproductive performance, calf weaning weight and cow productivity. control of development of anaemia, measured by pcv value during trypanosome infection, had the major effect on all three performance traits. the repeatability of this criterion (0.33) was almost equal to that of calf weaning weight, indicating pcv measurement might be suitable for identification of more trypanotolerant animals. simultaneous evaluation of the relative effects of control of development of anaemia in both the pre-weaner calf and its dam, on calf performance, suggested that its measurement in an animal might be feasible at an early post-weaner stage. guidelines for work to develop practical field tests for trypanotolerance involving post-weaners maintained for varying lengths of time in high natural challenge situations are suggested.
the s-100b substudy of the glutamics trial: glutamate infusion not associated with sustained elevation of plasma s-100b after coronary surgery. the efficacy of myocardial protection with a single aortic crossclamp and blood cardioplegia was evaluated in 819 consecutive patients stratified for preoperative condition by means of a new clinical risk scoring system. a protocol using either antegrade or antegrade/retrograde blood cardioplegia was compared with antegrade crystalloid cardioplegia in 2582 similar, consecutive, and concurrent patients. in the blood cardioplegia cohort, 97 (11.8%) patients had 129 complications compared with 407 (15.8%) patients and 675 complications in the crystalloid cardioplegia group (p = 0.006). in high-risk patients, combined antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia significantly reduced myocardial infarction, stroke, and respiratory and wound complications. despite the significantly longer aortic crossclamp time required for blood cardioplegia, patients undergoing crystalloid cardioplegia were 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.3, 2.1) times more likely to have a morbid event. time in the intensive care unit, length of hospitalization, and length-of-stay outlier status were significantly decreased in the blood cardioplegia compared with the crystalloid cardioplegia group. the net savings in hospital cost amounted to $2196 per case. when compared separately with crystalloid cardioplegia, combined antegrade/retrograde blood cardioplegia accounted for most of the morbidity reduction by significantly reducing perioperative myocardial infarction, wound complications, and length of stay in patients having reoperations. antegrade/retrograde blood cardioplegia did not influence 1-year survival or event-free survival, even when risk was considered.
proliferation in the rat olfactory epithelium: age-dependent changes the basal region in the developing olfactory epithelium of mice was investigated by double immunostaining using anti-keratin (ma903) and anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibodies. basal cells proper, which are ma903 positive, and globose basal cells, which are ma903 negative, were differentiated in the basal region on embryonic day 18 to postnatal day 1. at this stage, brdu-labeling was found more in the glubose basal cells than in the basal cells proper. the labeled globose basal cells increased in number and reached the maximum on postnatal day 3, and decreased in number on postnatal day 14. the labeled basal cells proper was concentrated near the border with the respiratory epithelium on postnatal day 1, but they were found in small numbers in other regions of olfactory epithelium during later stages of development. active division of globose basal cells accompanied the 1.5-fold increase in the thickness of the olfactory epithelium, which is caused by the increase in the number of olfactory cells, during development. it is suggested that during late embryonic and postnatal days olfactory cells originate from globose basal cells, not from basal cells proper. the division of basal cells proper may contribute to an 8-fold increase in the surface area of the olfactory epithelium during development.
evaluation of marbofloxacin in beagle dogs after oral dosing: preclinical safety evaluation and comparative pharmacokinetics of two different tablets abstract 1. the aim of the present study was to determine the pks of marbofloxacin in beagle dogs after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration, the ex vivo and in vitro pk/pd indices of marbofloxacin against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, and the ex vivo auc/mic ratios associated with different levels of antibacterial activity. 2. after i.v. of marbofloxacin (2 mg/kg), the mean ± sem values of auc, t1/2β, vss, and cl were 8.47 ± 3.51 h µg/ml, 8.08 ± 6.25 h, 2.32 ± 1.00 l/kg and 0.23 ± 0.06 l/kg/h and corresponding values after intramuscular injection were 11.37 ± 3.07 h µg/ml, 7.51 ± 3.70, 1.80 ± 0.90 l/kg and 0.17 ± 0.04 l/kg/h. after i.m. administration, a cmax of 1.76 ± 0.09 µg/ml was achieved at tmax of 0.47 ± 0.08 h. the ex-vivo auc/mic ratios required to produce bacteriostasis, bactericidal action and elimination of s. pseudintermedius were 65.03, 97.02 and 136.84 h. 3. the in vivo auc/mic ratios obtained after i.v. and i.m. administration of 2 mg/kg marbofloxacin (67.76 ± 1.23 and 91.18 ± 2.61) were below the ex vivo auc/mic ratios required for bactericidal activity and bacterial elimination (97.02 ± 9.24 2 mg/kg and 136.21 ± 7.58), suggesting that the recommended daily dosage (2 mg/kg) may not suffice to kill and eradicate s. pseudintermedius strains encountered in clinical area.
cmer functions as a pleiotropic regulator and is required for optimal colonization of campylobacter jejuni in vivo. the cmeabc multidrug efflux pump, which belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division (rnd) family, recognizes and extrudes a broad range of antimicrobial agents and is essential for campylobacter jejuni colonization of the animal intestinal tract by mediating the efflux of bile acids. the expression of cmeabc is controlled by the transcriptional regulator cmer, whose open reading frame is located immediately upstream of the cmeabc operon. to understand the structural basis of cmer regulation, we have determined the crystal structure of cmer to 2.2 a resolution, revealing a dimeric two-domain molecule with an entirely helical architecture similar to members of the tetr family of transcriptional regulators. unlike the rest of the tetr regulators, cmer has a large center-to-center distance (54 a) between two n termini of the dimer, and a large flexible ligand-binding pocket in the c-terminal domain. each monomer forms a 20 a long tunnel-like cavity in the ligand-binding domain of cmer and is occupied by a fortuitous ligand that is identified as glycerol. the binding of glycerol to cmer induces a conformational state that is incompatible with target dna. as glycerol has a chemical structure similar to that of potential ligands of cmer, the structure obtained mimics the induced form of cmer. these findings reveal novel structural features of a tetr family regulator, and provide new insight into the mechanisms of ligand binding and cmer regulation.
physiochemical and gene expression analyses reveal differential responses of the marine oleaginous alga nannochloropsis salina under different lipid-induction conditions the role of diatoms as a source of bioactive compounds has been recently explored. diatom cells store a high amount of fatty acids, especially certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas). however, many aspects of diatom metabolism and the production of pufas remain unclear. this review describes a number of technical strategies, such as modulation of environmental factors (temperature, light, chemical composition of culture medium) and culture methods, to influence the content of pufas in diatoms. genetic engineering, a newly emerging field, also plays an important role in controlling the synthesis of fatty acids in marine microalgae. several key points in the biosynthetic pathway of pufas in diatoms as well as recent progresses are also a critical part and are summarized here.
induction of ret dependent and independent pro-inflammatory programs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from hirschsprung patients there is increasing evidence that factors originally identified due to their neurotrophic activity also function within the immune system. this study focused on the related molecules glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) and neurturin (ntn) as well as their receptors. gdnf and ntn signaling is mediated by a two-component receptor: a signal-transducing component, ret, which is shared by both ligands, and a ligand-specific binding component, gfrα-1 (higher gdnf affinity) or gfrα-2 (higher ntn affinity). we report that human t cells, b cells, and monocytes produce ntn but not gdnf, as seen by rt-pcr and immunocytochemistry. ret was expressed by b cells, t cells, and monocytes. exons 2–5 of ret encoding the cadherin-like domains 1–3 in the extracellular part and exons 16–19 encoding a section of the second tyrosine kinase domain were transcribed in cd4+ t cells, cd8+ t cells, b cells, and monocytes. different splice variants encoding the c-terminal intracellular part (exons 19–21) of ret were detected. the ligand-binding receptors gfrα-1 and gfrα-2 were transcribed in all immune cell subsets. quantitative pcr showed that gfrα-2 is by far the dominant ligand binding chain in t cells, b cells, and monocytes. addition of gdnf or ntn to activated pbmcs reduced the amount of detectable tnf protein without altering its transcription. together, this suggests that immune cells communicate with each other via ntn. production of ntn by immune cells might also contribute to the neuroprotective immunity in the cns observed in different model systems.
increasing extracellular matrix collagen level and mmp activity induces cyst development in polycystic kidney disease background the appearance of interstitial fibrosis in polycystic kidneys is emblematic of progressive disease. matrix forming this scar tissue is derived from local renal cells in response to cystogenesis. we investigated the phenotype of collagen-producing cells in the cystic kidneys of dba/2-pcy mice to better characterize the spectrum of interstitial cells associated with renal fibrogenesis.   methods the extent of interstitial fibrosis and the number of fibroblasts in cystic kidneys were first quantitated over time using computer-assisted image analysis. subsequently, antisera to four cell protein markers were studied by coexpression immunohistochemistry during progression of fibrosis using confocal microscopy. the antisera included fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1) for fibroblast phenotype, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) for contractile phenotype, vimentin (vim) for mesenchymal phenotype, and heat shock protein 47 (hsp47) for interstitial collagen-producing phenotype.   results interstitial fibrosis in cystic kidneys gradually increased throughout the 30-week observation period of our study. with progression of cystogenesis, most of the tubules in pcy mice either dilated or disappeared with time. fsp1+ fibroblasts were distributed sparsely throughout the renal interstitium of young pcy and wild-type mice. their number increased in the widening fibrotic septa by 18 weeks of age and persisted through 30 weeks of the study interval. some epithelia among remnant tubules trapped within fibrotic septa around adjacent cysts also acquired the phenotype of fsp1+, hsp47+ collagen-producing fibroblasts, suggesting a possible role for epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (emt) in this process. most fsp1+ fibroblasts were alpha-sma-, but hsp47+, suggesting they were producing collagen proteins for the extracellular matrix. alpha-sma+, fsp1-, hsp47+ or hsp47- cells were also observed, and the latter tended to distribute independently in a linear pattern, reminiscent of vasculature adjacent to forming cysts. vim+ expression was not observed in alpha-sma+ cells.   conclusions many nonoverlapping as well as fewer overlapping populations of fsp1+ and alpha-sma+ cells shared in the collagen expression associated with progressive fibrogenesis in pcy mice undergoing cystogenesis. some fsp1+ fibroblasts are likely derived from tubular epithelium undergoing emt, while alphasma+, vim- cells probably represent vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes surviving vessel attenuation during the chaos of fibrogenesis. importantly, not all interstitial cells producing collagens are alpha-sma+.
association between variants in the genes for adiponectin and its receptors with insulin resistance syndrome (irs)-related phenotypes in mexican americans the adiponectin receptors, adipor1 and adipor2, are thought to transmit the insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and atheroprotective effects of adiponectin. in this study, we examined whether adipor mrna expression in human myotubes correlates with in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity. myotubes from 40 metabolically characterized donors expressed 1.8-fold more adipor1 than adipor2 mrna (588 +/- 35 vs. 321 +/- 39 fg/microg total rna). moreover, the expression levels of both receptors correlated with each other (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). adipor1 mrna expression was positively correlated with in vivo insulin and c-peptide concentrations, first-phase insulin secretion, and plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations before and after adjustment for sex, age, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat. expression of adipor2 mrna clearly associated only with plasma triglyceride concentrations. in multivariate linear regression models, mrna expression of adipor1, but not adipor2, was a determinant of first-phase insulin secretion independent of insulin sensitivity and body fat. finally, insulin did not directly modify myotube adipor1 mrna expression in vitro. in conclusion, we provide evidence that myotube mrna levels of both receptors are associated with distinct metabolic functions but not with insulin sensitivity. adipor1, but not adipor2, expression correlated with insulin secretion. the molecular nature of this link between muscle and beta-cells needs to be further clarified.
continuous-variable entanglement in a two-mode three-level cascade laser with a parametric amplifier we consider a two-photon correlated emission laser as a source of an entangled radiation with a large number of photons in each mode. the system consists of three-level atomic schemes inside a doubly resonant cavity. we study the dynamics of this system in the presence of cavity losses, concluding that the creation of entangled states with photon numbers up to tens of thousands seems achievable.
a prospective investigation of injury incidence and risk factors among army recruits in combat engineer training the rate of injuries resulting from physical exercise in sport centers as well as related factors has not yet been described. the aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of self‐reported activity‐specific injuries, to identify the relations between injury profile and different types and patterns of physical activity and to assess whether gender is a modifying variable in that connection. four hundred and fifty‐seven men and women aged 20–35 years participated in this cross‐sectional study. a questionnaire was used to evaluate the types and patterns of physical activity performed in the 12 months preceding the study and sports injuries sustained during that time. one hundred and ninety of the 457 subjects reported an injury as a result of exercising (41.6%). a relationship was found between weight training and injuries of the upper extremity (ue) for men and between spinning classes and knee injuries for women. among those who participated in weight‐training exercises, more frequent and longer duration exercise was associated with ue injury, and among those who participated in spinning classes more frequent exercise was associated with knee injury. future injury prevention programs in sport centers should pay special attention to men who participate in weight training and to women who participate in spinning classes.
hpv infection awareness and self-reported hpv vaccination coverage in female adolescent students in two german cities the aim of the study was to investigate knowledge of and attitudes to sexually transmitted infection (sti) and sti prevention with special focus on human papillomavirus (hpv) and the new vaccine against hpv, among 16-year-old high school students in a swedish context. a study-specific questionnaire was distributed to 572 first year high school students from five different high schools in a medium-sized town in sweden. the students lacked knowledge of hpv and its association with cervical cancer. similarly, their knowledge of the new vaccine was limited. their attitude to condom use when having sex with a new partner was positive, but decreased if oral contraceptives were used and if they were vaccinated against an sti. the main source of information was the school, followed by youth clinics and the media. the results highlight the clinical importance for school nurses and personnel at youth clinics to inform adolescents about hpv and its association with cancer.
6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to a peak-interval procedure highlights ► the effect of timing behaviour on cortical and striatal fos expression was examined. ► rats trained on the peak procedure (fipp) and a control schedule were compared. ► fos expression in the orbital pfc was enhanced following exposure to the fipp. ► fos expression in the striatum did not differ between rats trained on the two tasks. ► the results suggest that the orbital pfc is involved in interval timing behaviour.
dietary habits in adolescence related to sociodemographic factors, physical activity and self-esteem objective: to examine the dietary and activity correlates of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by children in middle and high school. methods: data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 15 283 children in middle and high schools in texas. consumption of sodas and noncarbonated flavored and sports beverages (fsbs) were examined separately for their associations with the level of (1) unhealthy food (fried meats, french fries, desserts) consumption, (2) healthy food (vegetables, fruit, and milk) consumption, (3) physical activity including usual vigorous physical activity and participation in organized physical activity, and (4) sedentary activity, including hours spent watching television, using the computer, and playing video games. results: for both genders, consumption of soda and fsbs was systematically associated with a number of unhealthy dietary practices and with sedentary behaviors. however, consumption of fsbs showed significant positive graded associations with several healthy dietary practices and level of physical activity, whereas soda consumption showed no such associations with healthy behaviors. conclusions: consumption of fsbs coexists with healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors, which suggests popular misperception of these beverages as being consistent with a healthy lifestyle. assessment and obesity-prevention efforts that target sugar-sweetened beverages need to distinguish between fsbs and sodas.
the hippocampal/parahippocampal regions and recognition memory: insights from visual paired comparison versus object-delayed nonmatching in monkeys monkeys in whom the fornix had been transected and controls were trained on two versions of delayed non-matching to sample (dnms). on dnms-lss the stimulus pair for each trial was selected from a large set of junk objects so that the animals saw particular stimuli infrequently. on dnms-rs the same two stimuli were presented repeatedly. memory for the sample was assessed with retention intervals of 10, 70 and 130 sec spent either in the dark or with levels of illumination designed to promote interference effects. on dnms-lss the lesioned animals were impaired, being more susceptible than controls to increases in the retention interval. however, neither group was particularly sensitive to interference. in contrast, on dnms-rs the lesioned monkeys were unimpaired, both groups showing a marked decrement in performance with increasing retention interval and a high sensitivity to the effects of interference. these data suggest that monkeys possess a short-term memory which is intact after transection of the fornix and a long-term memory which is not.
ct-optimized skin stroking delivered by hand or robot is comparable we show that the affective experience of touch and the sight of touch can be modulated by cognition, and investigate in an fmri study where top-down cognitive modulations of bottom-up somatosensory and visual processing of touch and its affective value occur in the human brain. the cognitive modulation was produced by word labels, 'rich moisturizing cream' or 'basic cream', while cream was being applied to the forearm, or was seen being applied to a forearm. the subjective pleasantness and richness were modulated by the word labels, as were the fmri activations to touch in parietal cortex area 7, the insula and ventral striatum. the cognitive labels influenced the activations to the sight of touch and also the correlations with pleasantness in the pregenual cingulate/orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum. further evidence of how the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in affective aspects of touch was that touch to the forearm [which has c fiber touch (ct) afferents sensitive to light touch] compared with touch to the glabrous skin of the hand (which does not) revealed activation in the mid-orbitofrontal cortex. this is of interest as previous studies have suggested that the ct system is important in affiliative caress-like touch between individuals.
computability and computational complexity of the evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems in this paper we consider the computability of the solution of the initial- value problem for differential equations and for differential inclusions with semicontin- uous right-hand side. we present algorithms for the computation of the solution using the "ten thousand monkeys" approach, in which we generate all possible solution tubes, and then check which are valid. in this way, we show that the solution of a locally lip- schitz differential equation is computable even if the function is not effectively locally lipschitz, and recover a result of ruohonen, in which it is shown that if the solution is unique, then it is computable. we give an example of a computable locally lipschitz function which is not effectively locally lipschitz. we also show that the solutions of a convex-valued upper-semicontinuous differential inclusion are upper-semicomputable, and the solutions of a lower-semicontinuous one-sided lipschitz differential inclusion are lower-semicomputable.
could alexithymia predict suicide attempts - a study of croatian war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. alexithymic features are often associated with depression, which is the most important risk factor for suicidal behaviors. nevertheless, little is known about the associations between alexithymia and suicidality. in this 12-month follow-up study we investigated the relationship between alexithymia and suicidal ideation in a sample of the general population (n = 1,563) using the 20-item toronto alexithymia scale (tas-20) and the 21-item beck depression inventory (bdi). suicidal ideation was more common among subjects with alexithymia than among nonalexithymic subjects (32% v 9% at baseline and 36% v 9% after 12 months). in cross-sectional analyses, alexithymia associated with the presence of suicidal ideation even after adjustment for sex, age, and several psychosocial and socioeconomic factors and the presence of depression. moreover, after adjustment for depression at baseline, the decrease and increase in alexithymic features during the study period associated independently with recovery from and the occurrence of suicidal ideation, respectively. nevertheless, these associations were no longer independent when adjusted for concomitant changes in the level of depressive symptoms. in conclusion, if depression presents alexithymic features the subject has an additive impact on the risk of suicidal ideation.
mediterranean diet and phase angle in a sample of adult population: results of a pilot study objective independently of total caloric intake, a better quality of the diet (for example, conformity to the mediterranean diet) is associated with lower obesity risk. it is unclear whether a brief dietary assessment tool, instead of full-length comprehensive methods, can also capture this association. in addition to reduced costs, a brief tool has the interesting advantage of allowing immediate feedback to participants in interventional studies. another relevant question is which individual items of such a brief tool are responsible for this association. we examined these associations using a 14-item tool of adherence to the mediterranean diet as exposure and body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (whtr) as outcomes. design cross-sectional assessment of all participants in the “prevención con dieta mediterránea” (predimed) trial. subjects 7,447 participants (55–80 years, 57% women) free of cardiovascular disease, but with either type 2 diabetes or ≥3 cardiovascular risk factors. trained dietitians used both a validated 14-item questionnaire and a full-length validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary habits. trained nurses measured weight, height and waist circumference. results strong inverse linear associations between the 14-item tool and all adiposity indexes were found. for a two-point increment in the 14-item score, the multivariable-adjusted differences in whtr were −0.0066 (95% confidence interval, –0.0088 to −0.0049) for women and –0.0059 (–0.0079 to –0.0038) for men. the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for a whtr>0.6 in participants scoring ≥10 points versus ≤7 points was 0.68 (0.57 to 0.80) for women and 0.66 (0.54 to 0.80) for men. high consumption of nuts and low consumption of sweetened/carbonated beverages presented the strongest inverse associations with abdominal obesity. conclusions a brief 14-item tool was able to capture a strong monotonic inverse association between adherence to a good quality dietary pattern (mediterranean diet) and obesity indexes in a population of adults at high cardiovascular risk.
role of hippocampal ca1 atrophy in memory encoding deficits in amnestic mild cognitive impairment a meta‐analysis of experimentally induced changes in blood flow (“activations”) in positron emission tomography (pet) studies of memory has revealed an orderly functional anatomic pattern: activations in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding are located primarily in the rostral portions of the region, whereas activations associated with episodic memory retrieval are located primarily in the caudal portions. these findings are based on an analysis of a sample of 54 “hippocampal encoding and retrieval” activations that were culled from an overall database consisting of 52 published pet studies of memory. we refer to this general pattern of rostrocaudal gradient of encoding and retrieval pet activations as the hiper (hippocampal encoding/retrieval) model. the model suggests a division of memory‐related labor between the rostral and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation. because functional anatomic pattern of encoding and retrieval activation that defines the hiper model was unprecedented and unexpected, it is difficult to relate the model to what is already known or thought about functional neuroanatomy of episodic memory in the hippocampal regions. the model is interesting primarily because its exploration may yield fresh insights into the neural basis of human memory. hippocampus 1998;8:313–322. © 1998 wiley‐liss, inc.
significance of the 13c-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis the properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. the aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (cbt) using orally administered 13c‐caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. the cbt was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis b or c; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the cbt in a cohort of these subjects. over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the cbt exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, p < .001). cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced cbt values (1.15 ± 0.75 δ‰ mg−1) compared with controls (2.23 ± 0.76; p = .001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 ± 1.05; p = .04). there was a significant inverse relationship between the cbt and child‐pugh score (r = −.74, p = .002). the intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated cbts in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. although smoking was associated with an 86% to 141% increase in cbt in all groups, the cbt was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 ± 0.82, 3.63 ± 1.21, and 2.14 ± 1.14, respectively, p = .001). multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (p < .001) and disease state (p = .001) were significant predictors of the cbt. in conclusion, the 13c‐cbt represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.
noxa as critical mediator for drug combinations in polychemotherapy cancer cells survive despite violating rules of normal cellular behaviour that ordinarily provoke apoptosis. the blocks in apoptosis that keep cancer cells alive are therefore attractive candidates for targeted therapies. recent studies have significantly increased our understanding of how interactions among proteins in the bcl2 family determine cell survival or death. it is now possible to systematically determine how individual cancers escape apoptosis. such a determination can help predict not only whether cells are likely to be killed by antagonism of bcl2, but also whether they are likely to be sensitive to chemotherapy that kills by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
auto/cross-regulation of hoxb3 expression in posterior hindbrain and spinal cord. the mouse kreisler gene is expressed in rhombomeres (r) 5 and 6 during neural development and kreisler mutants have patterning defects in the hindbrain that are not fully understood. here we analyzed this phenotype with a combination of genetic, molecular, and cellular marking techniques. using hox/lacz transgenic mice as reporter lines and by analyzing eph/ephrin expression, we have found that while r5 fails to form in these mice, r6 is present. this shows that kreisler has an early role in the formation of r5. we also observed patterning defects in r3 and r4 that are outside the normal domain of kreisler expression. in both heterozygous and homozygous kreisler embryos some r5 markers are induced in r3, suggesting that there is a partial change in r3 identity that is not dependent upon the loss of r5. to investigate the cellular character of r6 in kreisler embryos we performed heterotopic grafting experiments in the mouse hindbrain to monitor its mixing properties. control experiments revealed that cells from even- or odd-numbered segments only mixed freely with themselves, but not with cells of opposite character. transposition of cells from the r6 territory of kreisler mutants reveals that they adopt mature r6 characteristics, as they freely mix only with cells from even-numbered rhombomeres. analysis of phox2b expression shows that some aspects of later neurogenesis in r6 are altered, which may be associated with the additional roles of kreisler in regulating segmental identity. together these results suggest that the formation of r6 has not been affected in kreisler mutants. this analysis has revealed phenotypic and mechanistic differences between kreisler and its zebrafish equivalent valentino. while valentino is believed to subdivide preexisting segmental units, in the mouse kreisler specifies a particular segment. the formation of r6 independent of r5 argues against a role of kreisler in prorhombomeric segmentation of the mouse hindbrain. we conclude that the mouse kreisler gene regulates multiple steps in segmental patterning involving both the formation of segments and their a-p identity.
do “optimal” conditions improve distortion product otoacoustic emission test performance? objectives 1) to determine whether multivariate statistical approaches improve the classification of normal and impaired ears based on distortion product otoacoustic emission (dpoae) measurements, in comparison with the results obtained with more traditional single-variable applications of clinical decision theory. 2) to determine how well the multivariate predictors, derived from analysis on a training group, generalized to a validation group. 3) to provide a way to apply the multivariate approaches clinically.   design areas under the relative operating characteristic (roc) curve and cumulative distributions derived from dpoae, dpoae/noise, discriminant function (df) scores and logit function (lf) scores were used to compare univariate and multivariate predictors of audiometric status. dpoae and noise amplitudes for 8 f2 frequencies were input to a discriminant analysis and to a logistic regression. these analyses generated a df and lf, respectively, composed of a linear combination of selected variables. the df and lf scores were the input variables to the decision theory analyses. for comparison purposes, dpoae test performance was also evaluated using only one variable (dpoae or dpoae/noise when f2 = audiometric frequency). analyses were based on data from over 1200 ears of 806 subjects, ranging in age from 1.3 to 96 yr, with thresholds ranging from -5 to >120 db hl. for statistical purposes, normal hearing was defined as thresholds of 20 db hl or better. for the multivariate analyses, the database was randomly divided into two groups of equal size. one group served as the "training" set, which was used to generate the dfs and lfs. the other group served as a "validation" set to determine the robustness of the df and lf solutions.   results for all test frequencies, multivariate analyses yielded greater areas under the roc curve than univariate analyses, and greater specificities at fixed sensitivities. within the multivariate techniques, discriminant analysis and logistic regression yielded similar results and both yielded robust solutions that generalized well to the validation groups. the improvement in test performance with multivariate analyses was greatest for conditions in which the single predictor variable resulted in the poorest performance.   conclusions a more accurate determination of auditory status at a specific frequency can be obtained by combining multiple predictor variables. although the df and lf multivariate approaches resulted in the greatest separation between normal and impaired distributions, overlap still exists, which suggests that there would be value in continued efforts to improve dpoae test performance.
karyotype diversity of four species of the incertae sedis group (characidae) from different hydrographic basins: analysis of agnors, cma3 and 18s rdna. a cytogenetic study was conducted on an astyanax eigenmanniorum population from the caetano stream (18° 44' 56" s/ 048° 18' 39" w) - in uberlândia, mg, brazil - showing a modal diploid number of 48 chromosomes in the standard male and female karyotypes. however, in several specimens it was also possible to observe metaphases with one or two b chromosomes, increasing the diploid number to 49 or 50 chromosomes, respectively. the supernumerary chromosomes were totally heterochromatic and highlighted after c-banding. the silver-stained nucleolus organizing regions (ag-nors) were located in at least five chromosomes of the standard karyotype, thus characterizing a multiple nor system in the species. this is the first occurrence of an a. eigenmanniorum population with 2n = 48 chromosomes, bearing supernumerary chromosomes.
influence of oxygen partial pressures on protein synthesis in feeding crabs. 1. a single high-dose injection of 14c- (or 3h-) phenylalanine was used for measurement of protein synthetic rates in tissues of toadfish, opsanus tau, in vivo. 2. average rates at 20 degrees c, as per cent of tissue protein synthesized per day, were as follows: liver, 14; head kidney, 15; gill, 7.7; spleen 5.0; heart, 2.3; testis, 1.4; epaxial and pectoral muscle, 0.20-0.23. elevated rates in muscle (0.71%/day) were found in fed fish. 3. temperature dependency (q10) in the 10-20 degrees c range averaged 6-7 for tissues with high rates of protein turnover, and 3-4 in heart and muscle after two-weeks acclimation.
glucagon-like peptide-1 regulates proliferation and apoptosis via activation of protein kinase b in pancreatic ins-1 beta cells non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm, type 2 diabetes) is a disorder of glucose homeostasis characterized by hyperglycaemia, peripheral insulin resistance, impaired hepatic glucose metabolism, and diminished glucose-dependent secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells1. glucagon-like-peptide-1(7-37) (glp-1)2 is an intestinally derived hormone that may be useful for the treatment of niddm because it acts in vivo to increase the level of circulating insulin, and thus lower the concentration of blood glucose3,4. this therapeutic effect may result from the ability of glp-1 to compensate for a defect in the glucose signalling pathway that regulates insulin secretion from β-cells. in support of this concept we report here that glp-1 confers glucose sensitivity to glucose-resistant p-cells, a phenomenon we term glucose competence. induction of glucose competence by glp-1 results from its synergistic interaction with glucose to inhibit metabolically regulated potassium channels that are also targeted for inhibition by sulphonylurea drugs commonly used in the treatment of niddm5. glucose competence allows membrane depolarization, the generation of action potentials, and ca2+ influx, events that are known to trigger insulin secretion6,7.
anti-yeast activity of a food-grade dilution-stable microemulsion some microemulsions and nanoemulsions may have antimicrobial properties and be effective anti-biofilm agents. we examined the abilities of two fine emulsions, designated bctp and teop, to inactivate suspensions of vegetative cells of salmonella spp. escherichia coli 0157:h7 (vt-), pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes. bctp is an o/w nanoemulsion of soybean oil and tri-n-butyl phosphate emulsified with triton x-100, while teop is an o/w microemulsion of ethyl oleate with tween 80 as emulsifier and n-pentanol as a co-emulsifier. bctp was effective in reducing the cell numbers of l. monocytogenes, while teop was effective against all five organisms investigated. the abilities of these emulsions to reduce preformed biofilms of the five bacteria were also investigated. with the exception of the biofilm formed by l. monocytogenes, which surprisingly was not significantly affected by bctp, all biofilms were inhibited by both bctp and teop.
effect of hydration variability on hybrid layer properties of a self-etching versus an acid-etching system. objective fractographic analysis was conducted to evaluate the resin-dentin bond structures made under wet and dry conditions.   methods resin-dentin bonded specimens were prepared using two adhesive resin systems (single bond/sb; 3m and all bond 2/ab2; bisco inc) under wet and dry conditions. the specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the adhesive interface to produce a square bar-shaped specimen (adhesive area: 0.9 mm(2)) by means of a diamond saw. the mean bond tensile test was then conducted at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/min. the mean bond strengths were statistically compared with two-way anova and fisher's plsd test (p<0.05). subsequently, the fractured surfaces of all specimens were examined using sem and the area fractions of failure modes (%) were measured using an image analyzer on sem microphotographs.   results no significant differences in tensile-bond strength were observed between sb (60.1+/-16.4mpa) and ab2 (69.8+/-17.4mpa) (p>0.05) under wet conditions. however, the bond strength either of sb or ab2 made under wet conditions was significantly greater than those made under dry conditions (sb: 26.2+/-12.5mpa and ab2: 6.8+/-3.3mpa) (p<0.05). under fractographic analysis, the major portion at the fractured surface was occupied by the cohesive failure of bonding resin and the resin composite for the wet conditions, and the top of the hybrid layer for the dry conditions in both systems.   significance the interaction between the top of the hybrid layer and the bonding resin influenced the bond integrity.
flux de protéines endogènes dans l'intestin et métabolisme postprandial des acides aminés alimentaires chez les mammifères monogastriques et chez l'homme the aim of the study was to determine if there is a difference between ileal and faecal assays for determining amino acid and n digestibilities in adult human subjects. comparison of true ileal amino acid and n digestibilities was also made between adult human subjects and growing pigs to establish the usefulness of the pig as a model animal. five subjects with established ileostomies and six subjects with intact large bowels consumed a constant diet consisting of meat, vegetables, fruit, bread and dairy products for 7 d with collection of ileostomy contents or faeces respectively over the last 4 d. the study was repeated using 25 kg body weight ileostomized and intact pigs. apparent amino acid and n digestibility coefficients were determined. for human subjects the faecal digestibility values were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the ileal values for arg, asp, gly, phe, pro, ser, thr and trp. the faecal digestibility of met was significantly lower than the ileal value. determination of dna, diaminopimelic acid (dapa) and the digestibilities of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose in human subjects indicated that some microbial colonization had occurred at the terminal ileum after formation of an ileostomy; however, this was not as extensive as in the large intestine. true ileum amino acid and n digestibilities were calculated after correcting for the endogenous contribution of amino acids at the terminal ileum determined using a protein-free diet. there were no significant differences between adult human subjects and pigs for true ileal dietary amino acid digestibility except for thr, phe, cys and met. there were no significant differences between adult humans and pigs for the ileal digestibility of dry matter and the faecal digestibility of gross energy.
snow-induced changes in dwarf birch chemistry increase moth larval growth rate and level of herbivory insect damage changes plant physiology and chemistry, and such changes may influence the performance of herbivores. we introduced larvae of the autumnal moth (epirrita autumnataborkh.) on individual branches of its main host plant, mountain birch (betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (orlova) hämet-ahti) to examine rapid-induced plant responses, which may affect subsequent larval development. we measured systemic responses to herbivory by analyzing chemistry, photosynthesis, and leaf growth, as well as effects on larval growth and feeding, in undamaged branches of damaged and control trees. larvae reared on leaves from intact branches of the herbivore-damaged trees grew faster than those reared on leaves of control trees, indicating systemic-induced susceptibility. herbivore damage did not lead to systemic changes in levels of primary nutrients or phenolic compounds. the analyses of photosynthetic activity and individual hydrolyzable tannins revealed a reversal of leaf physiology-herbivore defense patterns. on control trees, consumption by e. autumnata larvae was positively correlated with photosynthetic activity; on damaged trees, this correlation was reversed, with consumption being negatively correlated with photosynthetic activity. a similar pattern was found in the relationship between monogalloylglucose, the most abundant hydrolyzable tannin of mountain birch, and leaf consumption. among the control trees, consumption was positively correlated with concentrations of monogalloylglucose, whereas among herbivore-damaged trees, this correlation was reversed and became negative. our results suggest that herbivore performance is related to both concentrations of phenolic compounds and photosynthetic activity in leaves. this linkage between herbivore performance, leaf chemistry, and physiology was sensitive to induced plant responses caused by slight herbivore damage.
expression of p2x receptors on rat microglial cells during early development 1 our aim was to assess whether atp‐induced inward currents in microglia are due to a single or more than one purinergic receptor. the atp dose‐response curve showed two components, whose presence might be due to the activation of high and low affinity receptors. 2 the p2z/p2x7 specific receptor agonist benzoylbenzoyl‐atp (bz‐atp) and some p2 receptor agonists were tested. the rank order of potency was bz‐atp >> atp = 2‐methylthio‐atp (2‐mesatp) > α,β‐methylene atp (α,β‐meatp) ≥ adp. β,γ‐methyleneatp (β,γ‐meatp), utp and adenosine were ineffective. 3 the non‐specific p2 receptor antagonist suramin antagonized by 92 ± 2 % the inward current induced by 100 μm atp, and by 51 ± 8 and 68 ± 6 % those induced by 3 mm atp and 100 μm bz‐atp, respectively. the p2z/p2x7 antagonist oxidized atp (oatp) almost abolished the inward current induced by 3 mm atp or bz‐atp, but was ineffective against 100 μm atp. 4 inward currents induced by low atp concentrations (≤ 100 μm) were generally followed by an almost complete and irreversible desensitization, while those elicited by atp ≥ 1 mm showed only a partial decline. interestingly, the inward current induced by 100 μm 2‐mesatp showed a large desensitization, while that induced by bz‐atp did not. 5 in voltage‐ramp experiments, the 100 μm atp‐induced current exhibited a slight inward rectification more visible at negative potentials, while the 3 mm atp‐induced current did not. 6 atp induced a fast and large increase in [ca2+] that promptly recovered in the continuous presence of low atp doses, but did not recover in high atp doses. as with desensitization, the response to bz‐atp mimicked that of high doses of atp. 7 when ca2+ mobilization due to p2y receptors was blocked by thapsigargin‐induced ca2+ depletion or by pertussis toxin treatment, 10 μm atp was still able to induce a ca2+ transient, which represented the contribution of the ca2+ influx induced by p2x receptors 8 in conclusion, the inward currents and a fraction of the ca2+ transients induced by atp in microglia are due to at least two atp‐sensitive receptor channel types, whose different properties and sensitivity to atp may be associated with different functional roles.
physiological and biochemical markers to optimize sugar mill wastewater for irrigation in maize (zea mays l.) crop nitro blue tetrazolium has been used to intercept o2− generated enzymically or photochemically. the reduction of nbt by o2− has been utilized as the basis of assays for superoxide dismutase, which exposes its presence by inhibiting the reduction of nbt. superoxide dismutase could thus be assayed either in crude extracts or in purified protein fractions. the assays described are sensitive to ng/ml levels of super-oxide dismutase and were applicable in free solution or on polyacrylamide gels. the staining procedure for localizing superoxide dismutase on polyacrylamide electrophoretograms has been applied to extracts obtained from a variety of sources. e. coli has been found to contain two superoxide dismutases whereas bovine heart, brain, lung, and erthrocytes contain only one.
effects of uncertainty and target displacement on the latency of express saccades in man backgroundpredictions from conduction velocity data for primate retinal ganglion cell axons indicate that the conduction time to the lateral geniculate nucleus for stimulation of peripheral retina should be no longer than for stimulation of central retina. on this basis, the latency of saccadic eye movements should not increase for more peripherally located targets. however, previous studies have reported relatively very large increases, which has the implication of a very considerable increase in central processing time for the saccade-generating system.resultsin order to resolve this paradox, we have undertaken an extended series of experiments in which saccadic eye movements were recorded by electro-oculography in response to targets presented in the horizontal meridian in normal young subjects. for stationary or moving targets of either normal beam intensity or reduced red intensity, with the direction of gaze either straight ahead with respect to the head or directed eccentrically, the saccadic latency was shown to remain invariant with respect to a wide range of target angular displacements.conclusionsthese results indicate that, irrespective of the angular displacement of the target, the direction of gaze or the target intensity, the saccade-generating system operates with a constant generation time.
alveolar macrophage cytokine response to air pollution particles: oxidant mechanisms. we sought to characterize the bioactive constituents of concentrated ambient air particles (caps) through correlation of alveolar macrophage (am) biological responses (production of tnf, macrophage inflammatory protein (mip-2), nitrite; cell viability) to components of particle samples. caps samples collected on different days showed a range of bioactivity and a strong correlation was found between am cytokine release and increased am light scatter, a flow cytometric measure of relative particle load. evaluation of soluble and insoluble fractions of caps suspensions indicate that 1) most biological effects on ams are mediated by insoluble components and certain particle adsorbed factors such as endotoxin; 2) the variable bioactivity of caps collected on different days arises primarily from differences in the relative proportion of insoluble and soluble mass present in particle suspensions; and 3) the activation state of the am influences which insoluble components are most bioactive. use of endotoxin neutralizing agents (e.g., polymyxin-b) showed particle-adsorbed endotoxin in caps suspensions causes activation of normal (control) ams while other (nonendotoxin) components are predominantly responsible for the enhanced cytokine release observed by primed ams incubated with caps. the am biological response did not correlate with any of a panel of elements quantified within insoluble caps samples (al, cd, cr, cu, fe, mg, mn, ni, s, ti, v). these data demonstrate an important role for cell activation and phagocytosis of insoluble particulate matter in the response of ams to caps suspensions.
the effect of social adjustment and attachment style on suicidal behaviour objective to describe the prevalence of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in a birth cohort of new zealand children studied to the age of 16 years; to examine the extent to which risks of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation varied with levels of adolescent psychopathology, problems of adjustment, and exposure to adverse conditions during childhood; and to examine the extent to which those attempting suicide could be distinguished from those reporting suicidal ideation alone.   method data were gathered on suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, psychiatric diagnoses, adjustment problems, and childhood factors during the course of a 16-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of new zealand children.   results twelve percent of this cohort reported suicidal ideation before the age of 16 years and 3% attempted suicide. the extent to which young people expressed suicidal tendencies varied with the extent to which the young person met criteria for psychiatric disorder, the extent of adjustment problems, and the extent to which the young person had been exposed to adverse family circumstances. those attempting suicide were distinguished from those reporting suicidal ideation by having significantly higher rates of psychopathology (p < .05), higher rates of adjustment problems (p < .005), and greater exposure to childhood and family adversity (p < .05).   conclusion the results of this analysis were consistent with a dimensional model of suicidal behaviors in which those attempting suicide are distinguished from those reporting suicidal ideation alone by having a greater burden of psychosocial risk factors including psychiatric disorder, adjustment problems, and adverse childhood circumstances.
assessment of lead ecotoxicity in water using the amphibian larvae (xenopus laevis) and preliminary study of its immobilization in meat and bone meal combustion residues pickerel frogs (rana palustris) and bullfrogs (rana catesbeiana) were exposed from the egg stage to lead-contaminated surface water from a trap and skeet range. seven experimental treatments were employed: 25, 50, 75 and 100% range water, 100% range water plus a chelating agent (sodium citrate), control water and control water plus chelating agent. total lead concentrations in 100% range water treatments varied from 840-3150 microg litre(-1), with the filterable form accounting for approximately 4-5% of the total. hatching was not affected in either species (p > 0.2). there were highly significant differences in mortality among treatments for r. palustris (p = 0.0001), with tadpoles exhibiting 100 and 98% mortality after 10 d of exposure to 100 and 75% range water, respectively. mortality in the 100% range water + citrate treatment was similar to controls (p > 0.05). there were no significant differences in mortality among treatments for r. catesbeiana after 10 d of exposure (p = 0.7119). exposure to lead in the range water did not adversely affect the growth of surviving r. palustris or r. catesbeiana tadpoles after 14 weeks and 10 weeks, respectively. in both species, the intestinal mucosa in tadpoles exposed to range water was reduced in thickness. scanning electron micrographs of r. palustris tadpoles that died in 100% range water revealed stunted tail growth, incurvation of the spine, hydropsy and generally reduced body size.
behavioral and molecular alterations in mice resulting from chronic treatment with dexamethasone: relevance to depression glucocorticoids stimulate the intestinal absorption of na(+) and water partly by regulation of the na(+)/h(+) exchanger 3 (nhe3). previous studies have shown both genomic and nongenomic regulation of nhe3 by glucocorticoids. serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (sgk1) has been shown to be part of this cascade, where phosphorylation of nhe3 by sgk1 initiates the translocation of nhe3 to the cell surface. in the present work, we examined a series of changes in sgk1 and nhe3 induced by glucocorticoids using human colonic caco-2 and opossum kidney cells. we found that dexamethasone rapidly stimulated sgk1 mrnas, but a significant change in protein abundance was not detected. instead, there was an increase in sgk1 kinase activity as early as at 2 h. an increase in nhe3 protein abundance was not detected until 12 h of dexamethasone exposure, although the transport activity was significantly stimulated at 4 h. these data demonstrate that the changes of sgk1 precede those of nhe3. chronic regulation (24 h) of nhe3 was blocked completely by prevention of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or actinomycin d and by the glucocorticoid receptor blocker ru486. the acute effect of dexamethasone was similarly abrogated by ru486, but was insensitive to cycloheximide and actinomycin d. similarly, the stimulation of sgk1 activity by dexamethasone was blocked by ru486 but not by actinomycin d. together, these data show that the acute effect of glucocorticoids on nhe3 is mediated by a glucocorticoid receptor dependent mechanism that activates sgk1 in a nongenomic manner.
effect of selenium supplementation on lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes, and lactate levels in rats immediately after acute swimming exercise dietary intake of selenium has been implicated in a wide range of health issues, including aging, heart disease and cancer. selenium deficiency, which can reduce selenoprotein levels, has been associated with several striated muscle pathologies. to investigate the role of selenoproteins in skeletal muscle biology, we used a transgenic mouse (referred to as i6a-) that has reduced levels of selenoproteins due to the introduction and expression of a dominantly acting mutant form of selenocysteine transfer rna (trna[ser]sec). as a consequence, each organ contains reduced levels of most selenoproteins, yet these mice are normal with regard to fertility, overall health, behavior and blood chemistries. in the present study, although skeletal muscles from i6a- mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from those of wild-type mice, plantaris muscles were approximately 50% heavier after synergist ablation, a model of exercise overload. like muscle in wild-type mice, the enhanced growth in the i6a- mice was completely blocked by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) pathway. muscles of transgenic mice exhibited increased site-specific phosphorylation on both akt and p70 ribosomal s6 kinase (p70s6k) (p < 0.05) before ablation, perhaps accounting for the enhanced response to synergist ablation. thus, a single genetic alteration resulted in enhanced skeletal muscle adaptation after exercise, and this is likely through subtle changes in the resting phosphorylation state of growth-related kinases.
maternally controlled (beta)-catenin-mediated signaling is required for organizer formation in the zebrafish. goosecoid (gsc) is an evolutionarily conserved homeobox gene expressed in the gastrula organizer region of a variety of vertebrate embryos, including zebrafish, xenopus, chicken and mouse. to understand the role of gsc during mouse embryogenesis, we generated gsc-null mice by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. surprisingly, gsc-null embryos gastrulated and formed the primary body axes; gsc-null mice were born alive but died soon after birth with numerous craniofacial defects. in addition, rib fusions and sternum abnormalities were detected that varied depending upon the genetic background. transplantation experiments suggest that the ovary does not provide gsc function to rescue gastrulation defects. these results demonstrate that gsc is not essential for organizer activity in the mouse but is required later during embryogenesis for craniofacial and rib cage development.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
fungal elicitor pep-25 increases cytosolic calcium ions, h2o2 production and activates the octadecanoid pathway in arabidopsis thaliana transient influx of ca2+ constitutes an early element of signaling cascades triggering pathogen defense responses in plant cells. treatment with the phytophthora sojae–derived oligopeptide elicitor, pep-13, of parsley cells stably expressing apoaequorin revealed a rapid increase in cytoplasmic free calcium ([ca2+]cyt), which peaked at ∼1 μm and subsequently declined to sustained values of 300 nm. activation of this biphasic [ca2+]cyt signature was achieved by elicitor concentrations sufficient to stimulate ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, oxidative burst, and phytoalexin production. sustained concentrations of [ca2+]cyt but not the rapidly induced [ca2+]cyt transient peak are required for activation of defense-associated responses. modulation by pharmacological effectors of ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane or of ca2+ release from internal stores suggests that the elicitor-induced sustained increase of [ca2+]cyt predominantly results from the influx of extracellular ca2+. identical structural features of pep-13 were found to be essential for receptor binding, increases in [ca2+]cyt, and activation of defense-associated responses. thus, a receptor-mediated increase in [ca2+]cyt is causally involved in signaling the activation of pathogen defense in parsley.
metallic burden of deciduous teeth and childhood behavioral deficits iron plays a role in the regulation of dopaminergic activity. in the present study, nonanemic children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) were evaluated with regard to heme and nonheme iron metabolism and the effect of short-term iron administration on behavior. the study group consisted of 14 boys aged 7-11 years. all first underwent testing to rule out other psychiatric and medical problems. the severity of the adhd symptoms was determined by parent and teacher scores on the connors rating scale. thereafter, each patient received an iron preparation (ferrocal), 5 mg/kg/day for 30 days. blood samples were taken before and after drug administration. results showed a significant increase in serum ferritin levels (from 25.9 +/- 9.2 to 44.6 +/- 18 ng/ml) and a significant decrease on the parents' connors rating scale scores (from 17.6 +/- 4.5 to 12.7 +/- 5.4). there were no changes in other blood parameters or in the teachers' scores on the rating scale. the effect of iron supplementation on the behavioral and cognitive symptoms in noniron-deficient adhd children merits further investigation using a placebo-controlled study.
chlorella vulgaris restores bone marrow cellularity and cytokine production in lead-exposed mice. the host-mediated antiviral effect of chlorella vulgaris extracts (cve) was evaluated in icr mice against murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) infection. mice treated with 10 mg of cve on days 3 and 1 before virus challenge survived lethal infection. the protective effect of cve was shown by a decrease in the infectious viruses replicated in the target organs of cve-treated icr mice. cve also protected mice from histopathological damage to the target organs due to mcmv infection. both the serum interferon (ifn) level and 2'5'-oligoadenylate (2-5a) synthetase activity were elevated in cve-treated and mcmv-infected mice, and were higher than those in the control mice. the natural killer (nk) activity of spleen cells, which is otherwise deteriorated by lethal mcmv infection, was remarkably augmented in cve-treated mice. neither virocidal nor virostatic activity of cve on mcmv was seen in vitro. thus, cve-induced resistance against mcmv seems to be host-mediated. the protective effect correlated with the augmentation of nk activity of the spleen cells and serum ifn activity, which inhibited replication of mcmv in the target organs and subsequently saved the mice from death.
identification of a face enhancer reveals direct regulation of lim homeobox 8 (lhx8) by wingless-int (wnt)/β-catenin signaling*♦ developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. these regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. we find that histone h3k27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing h3k4me1 alone. this indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.
endosomal katp channels as a reservoir after myocardial ischemia: a role for sur2 subunits. the female myocardium, relative to that of the male, exhibits sustained resistance to ischaemic tissue injury, a phenomenon termed sex‐specific cardioprotection (ssc). ssc is dependent upon the sarcolemmal katp channel (sarckatp), and protein kinase c (pkc). here we investigate whether pkc‐mediated regulation of sarckatp concentration can explain this endogenous form of protection. hearts from male (m) and female (f) rats were langendorff‐perfused for 30 min prior to either regional ischaemia–reperfusion (i/r), or global ischaemia (gisc). for both protocols, pre‐ischaemic blockade of pkc was achieved by chelerythrine (chel) in male (m + c) and female (f + c) hearts. additional female hearts underwent sarckatp antagonism during i/r by hmr‐1098 (hmr), either alone or in combination with chel (hmr + chel). gisc hearts were fractionated to assess cellular distribution of pkcɛ and sarckatp. sex‐specific infarct resistance was apparent under control i/r (f, 23 ± 3%vs. m, 36 ± 4%, p < 0.05) and abolished by chel (f + c, 36 ± 3%). female infarct resistance was susceptible to sarckatp blockade (control, 16 ± 2%vs. hmr, 27 ± 3%), and pkc blockade had no additional effect (hmr + chel, 26 ± 2%). the prevalence of kir6.2 and sur2 was higher in the sarcolemmal fractions of females (kir6.2: f, 1.24 ± 0.07 vs. m, 1.02 ± 0.06; sur2: f, 3.16 ± 0.22 vs. m, 2.45 ± 0.09; ratio units), but normalized by chel (kir6.2: f, 1.06 ± 0.07 vs. m, 0.99 ± 0.06; sur2: f, 2.99 ± 0.09 vs. m, 2.82 ± 0.22, m; ratio units). phosphorylation of sarcolemmal pkcɛ was reduced by chel (p‐pkcɛ/pkcɛ: control, 0.43 ± 0.02; chel, 0.29 ± 0.01; p < 0.01). we conclude that pkc‐mediated regulation of sarckatp may account for the physiologically sustainable dependence of ssc upon both pkc and sarckatp, and that this regulation involves pkc‐permitted enrichment of the female sarcolemma with sarckatp. as such, the pkc‐sarckatp axis may represent a target for sustainable prophylactic induction of cardioprotection.
the role of ocular perfusion pressure in glaucoma cannot be studied with multivariable regression analysis applied to surrogates. purpose. to assess the distribution of the 24-hour intraocular pressure (iop) in subjects with primary openangle glaucoma (poag) in a population-based study in rural west bengal. methods. all untreated poag patients (n = 132) identified by a door to door survey in the hugli district of west bengal were invited to attend a follow-up study in which iop was tested with a goldmann applanation tonometer at 10 am, 1 pm, 4 pm, 7pm, 10 pm, 1 am, and 6 am. results. 72 subjects with untreated poag (72/132; 88.6%) attended the study. of them, 59 (83.0%) had a peak iop ≤ 21 mm hg. the peak iop (mean ± sd) was 16.4 ± 4.2 mm hg. peak iop occurred in early morning in approximately 78.5% of the subjects (6 am to 10 am), and the trough occurred during night time in 72.2% of the subjects (10 pm to 1 am). the 24-hour iop (mean ± sd) was 14.2 ± 4.4 mm hg and the mean fluctuation was 4.0 ± 6.8 mm hg (range, 2–11 mm hg). in the 32 persons with unilateral glaucoma, no significant differences were found in mean 24-hour iop, peak iop, trough iop, or iop fluctuation when comparing the glaucomatous eye with the non glaucomatous eye (p > 0.05). conclusions. twenty-four–hour iop was similar between glaucomatous and controls (contralateral nonglaucomatous) eyes suggesting that factors other than iop may play a role in the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in these eyes.
scenario drafting for early technology assessment of next generation sequencing in clinical oncology purpose dramatic advances in genomic technology stand to revolutionize cancer care; however, little is known about patients' understanding and acceptance of personalized medicine and widespread genetic testing (gt).   patients and methods we conducted a formative, semi-structured interview study with a random sample of patients with lung, colorectal, and breast cancers to assess awareness of personalized medicine and gt and attitudes about somatic gt. willingness to undergo gt was elicited through hypothetic scenarios.   results sixty-nine patients participated; 71% were women; 42% were black; median age was 59 years; and 42% had an education level ≥ college. we found that a majority of patients either were not aware of the term "personalized medicine" or defined it in unexpected ways. although many patients identified relevant benefits of somatic testing (eg, informs treatment), many patients also expressed significant concerns (ie, psychological harm and discrimination). a majority of patients expressed a willingness to undergo somatic (predictive, 96%, prognostic, 93%) and germline (cancer risk without incidental information, 87%; cancer risk with incidental information, 81%; pharmacogenetic, 91%) testing; however, far fewer patients expressed a willingness to undergo full genome sequencing (62%). reluctance was attributed to concerns over incidental findings, information overload, and the lack of a clear benefit.   conclusion many patients relayed misunderstandings about somatic testing and a reluctance to undergo full sequencing; oncologists must carefully consider how they present testing to patients so that concerns over discrimination and psychological harm do not hinder test uptake. more work is needed to identify effective ways to communicate complex genomic concepts to patients and research participants.
allocation of metals and trace elements in different tissues of piscivorous species phalacrocorax carbo total mercury levels in different feather types (down, contour, tail and flight) in great cormorants (phalacrocorax carbo l.) were determined using cv-aas. feathers from great cormorants inhabiting the vistula lagoon ecosystem have an average hg level of 7.14 ± 3.99 (μg/g w.w.). age-dependent concentrations of hg were statistically significant (anova kruskal–wallis, p < 0.0001). there were also significant differences in hg levels in different parts of feathers from adults and immature birds (anova kruskal–wallis, p < 0.0001). cormorant chick feathers appear to be a potential biomonitor of hg pollution in the vistula lagoon ecosystem, but this subject requires further research.
screening for inhalational anthrax due to bioterrorism: evaluating proposed screening protocols. context in the event of a bioterrorist attack, it may be difficult to distinguish inhalational anthrax from viral respiratory tract disease. contribution this synthesis compares reported symptoms of 28 patients with inhalational anthrax and 4694 patients with viral respiratory tract illnesses. fever and cough were common in both infections. mental confusion or loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, and nausea and vomiting more often indicated anthrax, whereas sore throat and runny nose more often indicated viral infection. implications several symptoms, including neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms and shortness of breath, may help distinguish inhalational anthrax from respiratory viral illness. the editors the 2001 anthrax attacks in the united states, in which 11 people developed the inhalational form of the disease and 5 died, exposed a weakness in the u.s. medical response to bioterrorism (1). despite heroic efforts on behalf of the victims, physicians were largely unprepared to recognize the early symptoms and signs of this extremely rare and rapidly progressive infection in ambulatory patients (2). initially, 4 of the 11 patients were sent home after being seen as outpatients or in an emergency department with diagnoses that included viral syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis (3, 4). physicians first considered a diagnosis of anthrax in 2 of these patients (both postal workers) on their second visits to the emergency department and then only after hearing media reports of illness among other postal employees (3). inhalation of anthrax spores leads to clinical disease from elaboration of two toxins, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase known as edema factor and a zinc metalloproteinase called lethal factor, by phagocytosed bacteria in the mediastinal lymph nodes and bloodstream (5). classic pathologic findings include hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis; primary anthrax pneumonia is rare (6, 7). without prompt treatment, death occurs rapidly from a combination of shock and respiratory compromise. anthrax has been classified by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention as one of six category a bioterrorist agents posing the greatest risk to civilian populations (8). a large-scale anthrax attack has the potential to cause casualties on a scale that would quickly overwhelm local and regional health care treatment capacity (6). the emergency response to such an attack would probably include the establishment of multiple mass prophylaxis centers physically distinct from hospital emergency departments (to prevent overcrowding and potential contamination) for rapid dispensing of prophylactic antibiotics to exposed populations and for identifying individuals suspected of having inhalational anthrax (9). presumptive cases would be transferred to established or temporary medical care facilities for rapid definitive testing and initiation of combination antimicrobial treatment, which may improve outcomes (10-12). efficient management of this limited medical care capacity is an important secondary goal of outpatient triage during a bioterrorism response (13, 14). screening and triage protocols used in these settings would need to rely on presenting symptoms and signs because laboratory or radiographic testing will probably not be feasible in high-volume mass prophylaxis centers (15). we sought to establish an evidence base for developing a screening protocol for inhalational anthrax. the utility of such a protocol, which improves both case detection and case exclusion, would also extend beyond the immediate mass prophylaxis setting because large numbers of individuals outside the exposure zone will probably seek reassurance from health care providers for symptomatic illnesses in the aftermath of a major attack. providing scientific evidence on which to base these discussions may decrease postattack anxiety and inappropriate utilization of health care resources (16). methods clinical data on the 11 inhalational anthrax cases of 2001 are now widely available (3, 4, 17-20). because of the small number of cases in the contemporary attack, we performed a systematic literature review to identify additional original case reports of inhalational anthrax in the english-language medical literature. we searched two computerized databases (medline and web of science) for adult human case reports of anthrax infection between 1960 and 2000 using the keywords anthrax and case report. this yielded 44 references; 4 contained sufficient clinical data on inhalational anthrax to permit comparison with the 11 contemporary cases (21-24). tracing bibliographies of these articles and a recent review article (25) produced an additional 7 articles that were appropriate for inclusion, for a total of 11 reports on 17 cases (26-32). two of the cases involved patients from outside of the united states (22, 24). we interpreted lack of mention of a specific symptom or abnormal sign in these reports as indicating the absence of that finding from the patient's clinical presentation. we compared proportions of symptoms and signs in historical and contemporary cases using the fisher exact test; clinical features that had consistent prevalence rates in earlier and contemporary cases were candidates for comparison with viral respiratory tract disease. viral respiratory tract infections, such as with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses or coronaviruses, are appropriate comparison conditions for this study because of their prevalence and potential similarity to inhalational anthrax (15, 33). we searched medline for descriptive epidemiologic reports of presenting clinical features of laboratory-confirmed influenza and noninfluenza viral respiratory illnesses in ambulatory adults; we found five published studies that met the search criteria (34-38). we did not include studies that describe samples of mixed influenza and noninfluenza cases (39-42) or that present data already reported in these five studies (43). we did not compare anthrax cases with asymptomatic persons (because they would not present a screening dilemma) or with acutely ill patients (because they would probably not participate in mass screening). since there are no reports of inhalational anthrax in pediatric patients, we limited our comparison sample to adult patients. finally, we also compared anthrax cases to ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia to highlight the difficulty of distinguishing these two conditions (44). we calculated positive likelihood ratios with 95% cis for the presence of selected signs and symptoms in inhalational anthrax versus influenza, influenza-like illness, and ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia. the positive likelihood ratio is defined here as the prevalence of a symptom or sign among inhalational anthrax cases divided by the prevalence of the same symptom or sign in the influenza, influenza-like illness, or pneumonia comparison groups. the positive likelihood ratio is the multiplicative factor that increases or decreases the odds of having inhalational anthrax as opposed to one of these comparison diseases, given the presence of a clinical finding (45). therefore, the post-test probability of having inhalational anthrax is influenced by both the magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio and the pretest probability of having the disease (46). in the appropriate clinical setting (that is, when the pretest probability of having the target disease is not zero), likelihood ratios greater than 3 or less than 0.3 are considered clinically important (47). the general approach used heredeveloping diagnostic algorithms for rare diagnoses by using likelihood ratios and by establishing hypothetical comparison groups populated by common medical conditionshas been previously described (46, 48, 49). the study sponsors had no role in the design, conduct, and reporting of the data or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. results presenting symptoms and signs and radiographic results for the 11 deliberately infected contemporary cases and 17 occupationally or environmentally infected historical cases were similar, although contemporary patients reported significantly more fever/chills and fatigue or malaise (table 1). all but 1 of the 28 patients (including 100% of the contemporary patients) had fever, chills, or cough on presentation. (the single exception was a patient who presented with impending shock, which limited the ability to record a complete history.) other symptoms that affected more than half of all patients included dyspnea (68%), chest discomfort or pain (61%), and nausea or vomiting (61%). more than half of current case-patients and 43% of the combined sample presented with neurologic symptoms other than headache, including confusion, blurred vision, and dizziness. only a few patients with inhalational anthrax reported sore throat (18%) or rhinorrhea (14%). table 1. summary of symptoms and signs at initial presentation: historical versus contemporary patients with inhalational anthrax eighty-one percent of patients presented with abnormalities on lung auscultation, including rales or rhonchi (65%) and dullness or decreased breath sounds (58%). respiratory symptoms often did not match findings on lung physical examination. four of the five patients with no respiratory symptoms had positive findings (rales), whereas 8 of the 23 patients with respiratory symptoms had no abnormality on lung examination. outcomes differed significantly between historical and contemporary patients: 16 of the 17 historical patients died compared with only 5 of the 11 contemporary patients. the presenting clinical features of the 28 patients can be divided into nine symptom complexes involving respiratory; gastrointestinal; ear, nose, and throat; and nonheadache neurologic problems (figure 1). the single most common presentation was a combination of respirato
lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 prevents atherosclerosis via inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption in apolipoprotein e-knockout mice the main aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 synbiotic diets: 1) containing lactobacillus casei ascc 292 and fructooligosaccharides (lf diet); 2) containing l. casei ascc 292 and maltodextrin (lm diet); and 3) containing l. casei ascc 292, fructooligosaccharide, and maltodextrin (lfm diet) to reduce serum cholesterol in male wistar rats. the effect of the synbiotic diets on intestinal microflora, concentration of organic acids, and the possibility of translocation of lactobacilli were also investigated. the lfm diet lowered serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, whereas the lm diet increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. however, synbiotic diets did not contribute to a change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level compared with the control diet. there was a decrease in the population of staphylococci, bacteroides, escherichia coli, and total coliforms in most bowel regions with the lfm diet compared with the control (which did not contain any synbiotic). in general, the lfm diet contributed to a higher concentration of lactic acid that may have contributed to the decrease in the population of pathogenic microorganisms compared with the control. fructooligosaccharide was the preferred substrate for production of acetic acid. results from this study showed that the synbiotic diet that contained l. casei ascc 292, fructooligosaccharide, and maltodextrin beneficially altered cholesterol levels and produced a healthier bowel microbial population without translocation of lactobacilli to other organs.
regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene by 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of pandoraea sp. 12b-2 a nonoxidative decarboxylase, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, was found in agrobacterium tumefaciens iam12048. the enzyme activity was induced specifically by 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate. the purified enzyme was a homotetramer of identical 38 kda subunits. the purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. in the presence of khco3, the enzyme also catalyzed the regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene into 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate at a molar conversion ratio of 30%.
obesity and cancer screening according to race and gender background obesity is associated with increased colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. previous studies using telephone survey data showed that obese women were less likely to receive colorectal cancer screening. it is unknown if this is true among patients in primary care practices.   methods retrospective chart reviews were conducted in 2003-2004 of men and women in 22 suburban new jersey and pennsylvania primary care practices. data from patients age 50 years and over (n=1297) were analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression. the outcome measure was receipt of colorectal cancer screening (fecal occult blood test within 1 year, sigmoidoscopy within 5 years, colonoscopy within 10 years, or barium enema within 5 years) among obese and non-obese patients.   results overall, 39% of patients were obese and 29% received colorectal cancer screening. after controlling for age, gender, total number of co-morbidities, number of visits in the past 2 years, and number of years in the practice, obese patients had 25% decreased odds of being screened for colorectal cancer compared to non-obese patients (or 0.75, 95% ci, 0.62-0.91). the relationship of obesity and colorectal cancer screening did not differ according to gender. number of visits (or 1.04, 95% ci, 1.01-1.06) and male gender (or 1.53, 95% ci, 1.19-1.97) was associated with increased odds of receiving colorectal cancer screening.   conclusion identification of physician and patient barriers to colorectal cancer screening is needed, particularly in obese patients, so that effective interventions may be developed to increase screening in this high-risk group.
determination of reference values for intraocular pressure and schirmer tear test in clinically normal ostriches (struthio camelus) objective to examine the feasibility and accuracy of a handheld rebound tonometer, tonovet, and to compare the intraocular pressure (iop) readings of the tonovet with those of an applanation tonometer, tonopen xl, in normal eurasian eagle owls.   animals studied ten clinically normal eurasian eagle owls (20 eyes).   procedures complete ocular examinations, using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy, were conducted on each raptor. the iop was measured bilaterally using a rebound tonometer followed by a topical anesthetic agent after 1 min. the tonopen xl tonometer was applied in both eyes 30 s following topical anesthesia.   results the mean +/- sd iop obtained by rebound tonometer was 10.45 +/- 1.64 mmhg (range 7-14 mmhg), and by applanation tonometer was 9.35 +/- 1.81 mmhg (range 6-12 mmhg). there was a significant difference (p = 0.001) in the iop obtained from both tonometers. the linear regression equation describing the relationship between both devices was y = 0.669x + 4.194 (x = tonopen xl and y = tonovet). the determination coefficient (r(2)) was r(2) = 0.550.   conclusions the results suggest that readings from the rebound tonometer significantly overestimated those from the applanation tonometer and that the rebound tonometer was tolerated well because of the rapid and minimal stress-inducing method of tonometry in the eurasian eagle owls, even without topical anesthesia. further studies comparing tonovet with manometric measurements may be necessary to employ rebound tonometer for routine clinical use in eurasian eagle owls.
glucose metabolism in early onset versus late onset alzheimer's disease: an spm analysis of 120 patients. objective: to compare the hmpao spect cerebral perfusion patterns in early and late onset alzheimer’s disease. methods: twenty patients with early onset disease (<65 years) and 44 patients with late onset disease (>65 years) were studied. all patients fulfilled nincds-adrda clinical criteria and had details of disease severity and length of history at the time of imaging. technetium-99m hmpao spect brain scans were acquired on a multi-detector gammacamera and analysed visually and with statistical parametric mapping (spm99). results: patients with early onset disease had significantly greater posterior cortical association area involvement whereas those with late onset disease had significantly greater medial temporal hypoperfusion. these findings were unchanged after controlling for disease severity and length of illness. discussion: these functional imaging findings of the differences between early and late onset alzheimer’s disease are supported by published findings that include histopathological and clinical evidence; namely late onset patients tend to present with the characteristic involvement of the medial temporal lobes producing marked memory loss whereas early onset patients present with predominant posterior cortical association area involvement. these age related findings should be borne in mind when clinically diagnosing, and interpreting functional brain imaging studies in, patients with suspected alzheimer’s disease.
implication of tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 and hexosaminidase: relationship to pathogenesis of liver diseases liver cirrhosis is a risk factor for osteoporosis. nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms of bone mass loss in patients with viral cirrhosis. tnfalpha is a potent bone-resorbing agent. serum concentrations of soluble tnf receptor p55 (stnfr-55) correlate with clinical activity in liver cirrhosis. our aim was to evaluate the possible role of stnfr-55 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in patients with viral cirrhosis and its relationship with bone turnover markers. we studied 40 consecutive patients with viral cirrhosis and no history of alcohol intake and 26 healthy volunteers. bone mineral density (bmd) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine (ls) and femoral neck (fn). patients with viral cirrhosis had reduced bmd (expressed as the z-score) in all sites [ls, -1.5 +/- 0.22 (p < 0.001); fn, -0.37 +/- 0.15 (p < 0.01)]. serum concentrations of stnfr-55 and urinary deoxypyridinoline, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, were significantly higher in patients with osteoporosis than in patients without osteoporosis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). serum levels of stnfr-55 correlated inversely with bmd in ls (r = -0.62; p < 0.005) and fn (r = -0.47; p < 0.05) and positively with urinary deoxypyridinoline (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). our findings show that high serum concentrations of stnfr-55 play a role in the pathogenesis of viral cirrhosis-associated bone mass loss and provide evidence of increased bone resorption related to the high serum stnfr-55 levels.
understanding compliance to privacy guidelines using text-and video-based scenarios studies have repeatedly shown that users are increasingly concerned about their privacy when they go online. in response to both public interest and regulatory pressures, privacy policies have become almost ubiquitous. an estimated 77% of websites now post a privacy policy. these policies differ greatly from site to site, and often address issues that are different from those that users care about. they are in most cases the users' only source of information.this paper evaluates the usability of online privacy policies, as well as the practice of posting them. we analyze 64 current privacy policies, their accessibility, writing, content and evolution over time. we examine how well these policies meet user needs and how they can be improved. we determine that significant changes need to be made to current practice to meet regulatory and usability requirements.
mu-opioid receptor in the nucleus submedius: involvement in opioid-induced inhibition of mirror-image allodynia in a rat model of neuropathic pain previous studies have indicated that thalamic nucleus submedius is involved in opioid-mediated antinociception in tail flick test and formalin test. the current study examined the effects of opioids microinjected into the thalamic nucleus submedius on the allodynia developed in neuropathic pain model rats, and determined the roles of different subtypes of opioid receptors in the thalamic nucleus submedius opioid-evoked antiallodynia. the allodynic behaviors induced by l5/l6 spinal nerve ligation were assessed by mechanical (von frey filaments) and cold (4 degrees c plate) stimuli. morphine (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 microg) microinjected into the thalamic nucleus submedius contralateral to the nerve injury paw produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the mechanical and cold allodynia, and these effects were reversed by microinjection of the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1.0 microg) into the same site. microinjection of endomorphin-1 (5.0 microg), a highly selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, and [d-ala2, d-leu5]-enkephalin (10 microg), a delta-/mu-opioid receptor agonist, also inhibited the allodynic behaviors, and these effects were blocked by selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine hydrochloride (3.75 microg). however, the [d-ala2, d-leu5]-enkephalin-evoked antiallodynic effects were not influenced by the selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (5.0 microg). microinjection of the selective kappa-receptor agonist spiradoline mesylate salt (100 microg) into the thalamic nucleus submedius failed to alter the allodynia induced by spinal nerve ligation. these results suggest that the thalamic nucleus submedius is involved in opioid-evoked antiallodynia which is mediated by mu- but not delta- and kappa-opioid receptor in the neuropathic pain model rats.
the greening after extended darkness1 is an n-end rule pathway mutant with high tolerance to submergence and starvation1[open] in plant and animal cells, amino-terminal cysteine oxidation controls selective proteolysis via an oxygen-dependent branch of the n-end rule pathway. it remains unknown how the n-terminal cysteine is specifically oxidized. here we identify plant cysteine oxidase (pco) enzymes that oxidize the penultimate cysteine of erf-vii transcription factors by using oxygen as a co-substrate, thereby controlling the lifetime of these proteins. consequently, erf-vii proteins are stabilized under hypoxia and activate the molecular response to low oxygen while the expression of anaerobic genes is repressed in air. members of the pco family are themselves targets of erf-vii transcription factors, generating a feedback loop that adapts the stress response according to the extent of the hypoxic condition. our results reveal that pcos act as sensor proteins for oxygen in plants and provide an example of how proactive regulation of the n-end rule pathway balances stress response to optimal growth and development in plants.
the hippocampal/parahippocampal regions and recognition memory: insights from visual paired comparison versus object-delayed nonmatching in monkeys monkeys in whom the fornix had been transected and controls were trained on two versions of delayed non-matching to sample (dnms). on dnms-lss the stimulus pair for each trial was selected from a large set of junk objects so that the animals saw particular stimuli infrequently. on dnms-rs the same two stimuli were presented repeatedly. memory for the sample was assessed with retention intervals of 10, 70 and 130 sec spent either in the dark or with levels of illumination designed to promote interference effects. on dnms-lss the lesioned animals were impaired, being more susceptible than controls to increases in the retention interval. however, neither group was particularly sensitive to interference. in contrast, on dnms-rs the lesioned monkeys were unimpaired, both groups showing a marked decrement in performance with increasing retention interval and a high sensitivity to the effects of interference. these data suggest that monkeys possess a short-term memory which is intact after transection of the fornix and a long-term memory which is not.
cardiac disease in pediatric patients presenting to a pediatric ed with chest pain. childhood chest pain is a common complaint and often a recurrent, chronic symptom. a detailed history and complete physical examination are the most important aspects of evaluating a child with chest pain. childhood chest pain has a good prognosis. laboratory tests should only be ordered if they are indicated on the basis of history and physical examination findings.
evolutionary and functional analysis of old world primate trim5 reveals the ancient emergence of primate lentiviruses and convergent evolution targeting a conserved capsid interface after entry into target cells, retroviruses encounter the host restriction factors such as fv1 and trim5α. while it is clear that these factors target retrovirus capsid proteins (ca), recognition remains poorly defined in the absence of structural information. to better understand the binding interaction between trim5α and ca, we selected a panel of novel n-tropic murine leukaemia virus (n-mlv) escape mutants by a serial passage of replication competent n-mlv in rhesus macaque trim5α (rhtrim5α)-positive cells using a small percentage of unrestricted cells to allow multiple rounds of virus replication. the newly identified mutations, many of which involve changes in charge, are distributed over the outer ‘top’ surface of n-mlv ca, including the n-terminal β-hairpin, and map up to 29 ao apart. biological characterisation with a number of restriction factors revealed that only one of the new mutations affects restriction by human trim5α, indicating significant differences in the binding interaction between n-mlv and the two trim5αs, whereas three of the mutations result in dual sensitivity to fv1n and fv1b. structural studies of two mutants show that no major changes in the overall ca conformation are associated with escape from restriction. we conclude that interactions involving much, if not all, of the surface of ca are vital for trim5α binding.
phenotypic and genotypic characterization of tetracycline and minocycline resistance in clostridium perfringens aims:  to determine if environmental clostridium perfringens carry antibiotic resistance genes and if the genes are mobile.
genetic and phenotypic parameters for carcass traits of american shorthorn beef cattle. least squares means, genetic (sigma g), and phenotypic (sigma p) standard deviations, and phenotypic coefficients of variation (cv) were estimated on an age-constant basis for growth, carcass, and meat traits of castrate males from 12 breed groups combined, for 9 purebreds combined, and for the f3 generation of three composite populations combined to which the nine purebreds contributed. also, heritabilities (h2) and genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations were estimated among growth, carcass, and meat traits for all breed groups combined involving 1,594 individuals that were the progeny of 306 sires (214 purebred and 92 composites). coefficients of variation and sigma g generally were similar for composites and contributing purebreds for growth and size-related traits. for traits relating to carcass composition and meat quality, means, sigma p, or cv for composites and contributing purebreds generally were similar. generally, estimates of sigma g and h2 were similar among all breed groups combined, contributing purebreds combined, and composites combined. generally, rg were high among all measures of carcass fat, indicating major difficulty in achieving a high percentage of retail product simultaneously with a high fat content of the longissimus muscle that is required for carcass quality grade. generally, rp were of smaller magnitude than rg. all rp of marbling score or percentage of ether-extracted fat in the longissimus muscle with all end-use properties relating to palatability including shear force, and sensory evaluation of tenderness, juiciness, and flavor were below .30.
persistent staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: an analysis of risk factors and outcomes. background the causes of persistent bacteremia (pb) due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) are poorly understood. this investigation examined potential associations between pb with key clinical features and several in vitro bacterial genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, in isolates from 1 institution.   methods pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) relatedness, thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (tpmp)-susceptibility phenotype, accessory gene regulator (agr) genotype and functionality (via delta-lysin production), and autolysis phenotypes were assessed in mrsa isolates from the bloodstream of 21 prospectively identified patients with pb (blood cultures positive after > or =7 days of therapy) and of 18 patients with resolving bacteremia (rb) (sterile blood cultures within the first 2-4 days of therapy) due to mrsa.   results the 2 groups had comparable baseline characteristics but differed in their clinical courses (e.g., endocarditis was more frequent in patients with pb than in those with rb [43% vs. 0%, respectively; p=.0016]); isolates from patients with pb exhibited higher rates of (1) survival in vitro after exposure to tpmp (22.4+/-14.8% vs. 11.6+/-6.5%, respectively; p=.005); (2) defective delta-lysin production (71.4% vs. 38.9%, respectively; p=.057); (3) non-agr genotype ii profile (100% vs. 77.8%, respectively; p=.037); and (4) overrepresentation of a specific pfge genotype (85.7% vs. 44.4%, respectively; p=.015).   conclusions isolates from patients with pb differed from those in patients with rb, in several in vitro characteristics. further studies will be necessary to define how these factors might affect clinical outcome.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
querying linked ontological data through distributed summarization query processing of owl-dl ontologies is intractable in the worst case, but we present a novel technique that in practice allows for efficient querying of ontologies with large aboxes in secondary storage. we focus on the processing of instance retrieval queries, i.e., queries that retrieve individuals in the abox which are instances of a given concept c. our technique uses summarization and refinement to reduce instance retrieval to a small relevant subset of the original abox. we demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in aboxes with up to 7 million assertions. our results are applicable to the very expressive description logic shin, which corresponds to owl-dl minus nominals and datatypes.
risk of subsequent gastrointestinal cancer among childhood cancer survivors: a systematic review. background although elevated risks of pancreatic cancer have been observed in long-term survivors of hodgkin lymphoma (hl), no prior study has assessed the risk of second pancreatic cancer in relation to radiation dose and specific chemotherapeutic agents.   patients and methods we conducted an international case-control study within a cohort of 19 882 hl survivors diagnosed from 1953 to 2003 including 36 cases and 70 matched controls.   results median ages at hl and pancreatic cancer diagnoses were 47 and 60.5 years, respectively; median time to pancreatic cancer was 19 years. pancreatic cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose to the pancreatic tumor location (ptrend = 0.005) and increasing number of alkylating agent (aa)-containing cycles of chemotherapy (ptrend = 0.008). the odds ratio (or) for patients treated with both subdiaphragmatic radiation (≥10 gy) and ≥6 aa-containing chemotherapy cycles (13 cases, 6 controls) compared with patients with neither treatment was 17.9 (95% confidence interval 3.5-158). the joint effect of these two treatments was significantly greater than additive (p = 0.041) and nonsignificantly greater than multiplicative (p = 0.29). especially high risks were observed among patients receiving ≥8400 mg/m(2) of procarbazine with nitrogen mustard or ≥3900 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide.   conclusion our study demonstrates for the first time that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy substantially increase pancreatic cancer risks among hl survivors treated in the past. these findings extend the range of nonhematologic cancers associated with chemotherapy and add to the evidence that the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can lead to especially large risks.
the serotonin transporter gene 5-httlpr polymorphism is associated with affective psychoses but not with schizophrenia: a large-scale study in the russian population. abstract: depression and suicidal behavior are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia. the serotonin transporter protein regulates serotonergic signaling at synapses and is encoded by a single gene (slc6a4; locus link id: 6532), located at 17q11.1-q12 with two polymorphic variants (the short and the long allele). the short allele of serotonin transporter gene has been associated with depression and suicidality in individuals who suffered negative life events and with depression in individuals with chronic psychosis.. subjects were recruited from a genetic study of schizophrenia conducted in costa rica. the authors replicated their previous research, using a more narrow phenotype (only schizophrenic subjects) and a more ethnically homogenous sample (only costa rican schizophrenic individuals who were not included in the previous study). the authors hypothesized that subjects with at least one copy of the serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism (5-httlpr) “s” allele would have a greater history of lifetime depression and suicidability rate than those who had an “l/l” genotype. the authors analyzed 155 subjects with a dsm-iv (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition) diagnosis of schizophrenia (73% male, age at interview 38.3, sd = 11.23). the genotype distribution was “ss” 58 (37%), “sl” 69 (45%), and “ll” 28 (18%). in the secondary analysis, the authors explored association of the “s” allele with lifetime history of suicide behavior in 173 subjects (18 more subjects than primary analysis because schizophrenic individuals were included regardless of history of depression). the authors found that subjects carrying at least one short allele had a significant increased lifetime risk for depressive syndromes (χ2 = 5.4, df = 1, p = 0.02; odds ratio [or] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.15–6.3). no association was found for suicidal behavior in the same sample (χ2 = 0.928, p = 0.629). in conclusion, the genotype at the 5-httlpr promoter polymorphic locus increases the risk of developing major depression but not suicidal behavior during the course of the schizophrenia in these patients. due to the small sample size, these results should be followed by definitive replication.
neuroanatomy of pain-deficiency and cross-modal activation in calcium channel subunit (cacn) α2δ3 knockout mice the thalamocortical tract carries sensory information to the neocortex. it has long been recognized that the neocortical pioneer axons of subplate neurons are essential for thalamocortical development. herein we report that an axon guidance cue, draxin, is expressed in early-born neocortical neurons, including subplate neurons, and is necessary for thalamocortical development. in draxin−/− mice, thalamocortical axons do not enter the neocortex. this phenotype is sufficiently rescued by the transgenic expression of draxin in neocortical neurons. genetic interaction data suggest that draxin acts through deleted in colorectal cancer (dcc) and neogenin (neo1), to regulate thalamocortical projections in vivo. draxin promotes the outgrowth of thalamic axons in vitro and this effect is abolished in thalamic neurons from dcc and neo1 double mutants. these results suggest that draxin from neocortical neurons controls thalamocortical projections into the neocortex, and that this effect is mediated through the dcc and neo1 receptors.
co-suppression of synthesis of major α-kafirin sub-class together with γ-kafirin-1 and γ-kafirin-2 required for substantially improved protein digestibility in transgenic sorghum abstract to improve sorghum grain protein nutritional quality, improved sorghum lines were transformed to suppress the synthesis of different kafirin sub-classes, or backcrossed into transgenic lines with improved protein quality. co-suppression of the alpha-, gamma- and delta-kafirin sub-classes and removal of the tannin trait resulted in transgenic sorghum lines with high cooked protein digestibility (±80%), improved amino acid score (0.8) and protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (0.7) compared to the non-transgenic null controls (±50%, 0.4 and 0.2, respectively). these high protein quality lines had a floury endosperm. they also had modified protein body structure, where the protein bodies were irregular shaped with few to numerous invaginations and were less densely packed, with a dense protein matrix visible around the protein bodies. when fewer sub-classes were suppressed, i.e. gamma 1 and delta 2, the endosperm was corneous with normal protein body structure but the improvement in cooked protein digestibility appeared to be less. apparently, co-suppression of several kafirin sub-classes is required to obtain high protein nutritional quality sorghum lines, but this seems to result in floury-type grain endosperm texture.
the inhibition of the nitric oxide-cgmp-pkg-jnk signaling pathway avoids the development of tolerance to the local antiallodynic effects produced by morphine during neuropathic pain. in the present study, we investigated the possible development of tolerance to the antihyperalgesic effect of µ‐opioid receptor (mor) agonists under a neuropathic pain‐like state. repeated treatment with fentanyl, but not morphine or oxycodone, produced a rapid development of tolerance to its antihyperalgesic effect in mice with sciatic nerve ligation. like the behavioral study, g‐protein activation induced by fentanyl was significantly reduced in membranes obtained from the spinal cord of nerve‐ligated mice with in vivo repeated injection of fentanyl. in β‐endorphin‐knockout mice with nerve ligation, developed tolerance to the antihyperalgesic effect of fentanyl was abolished, and reduced g‐protein activation by fentanyl after nerve ligation with fentanyl was reversed to the normal level. the present findings indicate that released β‐endorphin within the spinal cord may be implicated in the rapid development of tolerance to fentanyl under a neuropathic pain‐like state.
convolution inequalities for the boltzmann collision operator we investigate a boltzmann equation for inelastic scattering in which the relative velocity in the collision frequency is approximated by the thermal speed. the inelasticity is given by a velocity variable restitution coefficient. this equation is the analog to the boltzmann classical equation for maxwellian molecules. we study the homogeneous regime using fourier analysis methods. we analyze the existence and uniqueness questions, the linearized operator around the dirac delta function, self-similar solutions and moment equations. we clarify the conditions under which self-similar solutions describe the asymptotic behavior of the homogeneous equation. we obtain formally a hydrodynamic description for near elastic particles under the assumption of constant and variable restitution coefficient. we describe the linear long-wave stability/instability for homogeneous cooling states.
stroke with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: a descriptive population-based study from the brest stroke registry background: prospective population-based studies are important to accurately determine the incidence and characteristics of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (af), while avoiding selection bias which may complicate hospital-based studies. methods: we investigated af-associated stroke within the north dublin population stroke study, a prospective cohort study of stroke/transient ischaemic attack in 294,592 individuals, according to recommended criteria for rigorous stroke epidemiological studies. results: of 568 stroke patients ascertained in the first year, 31.2% (177/568) were associated with af (90.4%, i.e. 160/177 ischaemic infarcts). the crude incidence rate of all af-associated stroke was 60/100,000 person-years (95% ci = 52–70). prior stroke was almost twice as common in af compared to non-af groups (21.9 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.01). the frequency of af progressively increased across ischaemic stroke patients stratified by increasing stroke severity (nihss 0–4, 29.7%; 5–9, 38.1%; 10–14, 43.8%; ≥15, 53.3%, p < 0.0001). the 90-day trajectory of recovery of af-associated stroke was identical to that of non-af stroke, but rankin scores in af stroke remained higher at 7, 28 and 90 days (p < 0.001 for all). discussion: af-associated stroke occurred in one third of all patients and was associated with a distinct profile of recurrent, severe and disabling stroke. targeted strategies to increase anticoagulation rates may provide a substantial benefit to prevent severe disabling stroke at a population level.
a sleep continuity scale in alzheimer’s disease: validation and relationship with cognitive and functional deterioration disturbed sleep cycles are the principal cause of institutionalization in dementia, and therefore represent a major clinical problem. they may arise from dysfunction within the circadian clock of the hypothalamus that times and consolidates wakefulness, or from neuropathology in output pathways and/or target sites of the clock specifically controlling sleep and wakefulness. to determine the relationship of disturbed activity cycles to other circadian clock-controlled rhythms, cross-sectional and longitudinal actigraphy and serial sampling of saliva were used to compare the impact of early alzheimer's dementia on activity/rest and cortisol rhythms in home-dwelling subjects. mildly demented subjects had daily activity rhythms comparable to those of healthy age-matched subjects. moderately demented subjects exhibited a range of disturbances of the activity/rest cycle, with reduced stability, increased fragmentation and loss of amplitude. within the moderately demented group, however, the degree of circadian disruption was not correlated with the individual severity of dementia. all groups of subjects, mild, moderate with normal activity cycles and moderate with abnormal activity cycles, exhibited robust daily profiles of salivary cortisol, with highest levels in the morning (08:00 h) and an evening nadir (20:00-24:00 h). salivary cortisol levels tended to be higher in the moderately demented subjects in the afternoon, but this effect was not specific to those with abnormal activity/rest patterns. the actimetric data confirm that deterioration of activity/rest cycles is a common and progressive feature in home-dwelling alzheimer's patients, occurring early in the disease but after the measurable onset of dementia. the maintenance of highly rhythmic daily cortisol profiles in association with disturbed activity profiles, both on an individual and on a group basis, demonstrates that loss of circadian control to activity/rest cycles is not a consequence of global circadian disruption in early dementia. rather, pathology may develop in discrete elements of the circadian clockwork and/or its output systems that control activity/rest, sleep and wakefulness. further characterization of this pathology will facilitate more effective management of sleep patterns in home-dwelling demented patients.
a rosemary extract enriched in carnosic acid improves circulating adipocytokines and modulates key metabolic sensors in lean zucker rats: critical and contrasting differences in the obese genotype. the worldwide epidemic of obesity has brought considerable attention to research aimed at understanding the biology of adipocytes (fat cells) and the events occurring in adipose tissue (fat) and in the bodies of obese individuals. accumulating evidence indicates that obesity causes chronic low-grade inflammation and that this contributes to systemic metabolic dysfunction that is associated with obesity-linked disorders. adipose tissue functions as a key endocrine organ by releasing multiple bioactive substances, known as adipose-derived secreted factors or adipokines, that have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activities. dysregulated production or secretion of these adipokines owing to adipose tissue dysfunction can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-linked complications. in this review, we focus on the role of adipokines in inflammatory responses and discuss their potential as regulators of metabolic function.
laminarly orthogonal excitation of fast-spiking and low-threshold-spiking interneurons in mouse motor cortex the extent to which neocortical pyramidal cells function as a local network is determined by the strength and probability of their connections. by mapping connections between pyramidal cells we show here that in a local network of about 600 pyramidal cells located within a cylindrical volume of 200 μm × 200 μm of neocortical layer 2/3, an individual pyramidal cell receives synaptic inputs from about 30 other pyramidal neurons, with the majority of epsp amplitudes in the 0.2–1.0 mv range. the probability of connection decreased from 0.09 to 0.01 with intercell distance (over the range 25–200 μm). within the same volume, local interneuron (fast‐spiking non‐accomodating interneuron, fs)‐pyramidal cell connections were about 10 times more numerous, with the majority of connections being reciprocal. the probability of excitatory and inhibitory connections between pyramidal cells and fs interneurons decreased only slightly with distance, being in the range 0.5–0.75. pyramidal cells in the local network received strong synaptic input during stimulation of afferent fibres in layers 1 and 6. minimal‐like stimulation of layer 1 or layer 6 inputs simultaneously induced postsynaptic potentials in connected pyramidal cells as well as in pyramidal‐fs cell pairs. these inputs readily induced firing of pyramidal cells, although synaptically connected cells displayed different firing patterns. unitary epsps in pyramidal‐pyramidal cell pairs did not detectably alter cell firing. fs interneurons fire simultaneously with pyramidal cells. in pyramidal‐fs cell pairs, both unitary epsps and ipsps efficiently modulated cell firing patterns. we suggest that computation in the local network may proceed not only by direct pyramidal‐pyramidal cell communication but also via local interneurons. with such a high degree of connectivity with surrounding pyramidal cells, local interneurons are ideally poised to both coordinate and expand the local pyramidal cell network via pyramidal‐ interneuron‐ pyramidal communication.
the effect of melatonin treatment on postural stability, muscle strength, and quality of life and sleep in postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial abstract:  the purpose of this double‐blind study was to assess the effects of nightly melatonin supplementation on bone health and quality of life in perimenopausal women. a total of 18 women (ages 45–54) were randomized to receive melatonin (3 mg, p.o., n = 13) or placebo (n = 5) nightly for 6 months. bone density was measured by calcaneal ultrasound. bone turnover marker (osteocalcin, oc for bone formation and ntx for bone resorption) levels were measured bimonthly in serum. participants completed menopause‐specific quality of life‐intervention (menqol) and pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) questionnaires before and after treatment. subjects also kept daily diaries recording menstrual cycling, well‐being, and sleep patterns. the results from this study showed no significant change (6‐month‐baseline) in bone density, ntx, or oc between groups; however, the ratio of ntx:oc trended downward over time toward a ratio of 1:1 in the melatonin group. melatonin had no effect on vasomotor, psychosocial, or sexual menqol domain scores; however, it did improve physical domain scores compared to placebo (mean change melatonin: −0.6 versus placebo: 0.1, p < 0.05). menstrual cycling was reduced in women taking melatonin (mean cycles melatonin: 4.3 versus placebo: 6.5, p < 0.05), and days between cycles were longer (mean days melatonin: 51.2 versus placebo: 24.1, p < 0.05). no differences in duration of menses occurred between groups. the overall psqi score and average number of hours slept were similar between groups. these findings show that melatonin supplementation was well tolerated, improved physical symptoms associated with perimenopause, and may restore imbalances in bone remodeling to prevent bone loss. further investigation is warranted.
localization of lipocaline-type prostaglandin d synthase in rat brain: immunoelectron microscopic study glutathione-independent prostaglandin d synthase [prostaglandin-h2 d-isomerase; (5z,13e)-(15s)-9 alpha,11 alpha-epidioxy-15-hydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoate d-isomerase, ec 5.3.99.2] is an enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of prostaglandin d2 in the central nervous system. in situ hybridization with antisense rna for the enzyme indicated that mrna for the enzyme was predominantly expressed in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes of the adult rat brain. the findings agree with those obtained by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the enzyme. it was further revealed that prostaglandin d synthase activity was considerably greater in the isolated leptomeninges (14.2 nmol per min per mg of protein) and choroid plexus (7.0 nmol per min per mg of protein) than the activity in the whole brain (2.0 nmol per min per mg of protein). these results, taken together, indicate that the enzyme is mainly synthesized and located in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes in the brain.
the influence of secondhand smoke exposure on birth outcomes in jordan we analysed the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy on fetal growth parameters in 129 term newborns. children were classified into four depending on exposure on the basis of a questionnaire completed by the mother. the results confirmed that tobacco smoking reduced weight, length, cranial and thoracic perimeters at birth when exposure was due to either active or passive smoking. weight deficits of infants whose mothers smoked heavily (458 g) were higher than those whose mothers were exposed to passive smoking (192 g). we conclude that passive smoking is a very important variable and should be taken into account in any study of neonatal growth parameters.
associations of hsd11b1 polymorphisms with tacrolimus concentrations in chinese renal transplant recipients with prednisone combined therapy objective regeneration of cortisol by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-hsd1) within liver and adipose tissue may be of pathophysiological importance in obesity and the metabolic syndrome. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in hsd11b1, the gene encoding 11β-hsd1, have been associated with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in population-based cohort studies, and with hyperandrogenism in patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). however, the functional consequences of these snps for in vivo 11β-hsd1 expression and activity are unknown.   methods we explored associations of well-characterised hormonal and metabolic phenotypes with two common snps (rs846910 and rs12086634) in hsd11b1 in 600 women (300 with pcos) and investigated 11β-hsd1 expression and activity in a nested study of 40 women from this cohort.   results hsd11b1 genotypes (as single snps and as the combination of the two minor allele snps) were not associated with pcos. women who were heterozygous for rs846910 a and homozygous for rs12086634 t (ga, tt genotype) had a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, regardless of the diagnosis of pcos (odds ratio in the whole cohort=2.77 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.16-6.67), p=0.023). in the nested cohort, women with the ga, tt genotype had higher hsd11b1 mrna levels in adipose tissue, and higher rates of appearance of cortisol and d3-cortisol (16.1±0.7 nmol/min versus 12.1±1.1, p=0.044) during 9,11,12,12-2h4-cortisol (d4-cortisol) steady-state infusion.   conclusions we conclude that, in a population of southern european caucasian women with and without pcos, alleles of hsd11b1 containing the two snps rs846910 a and rs12086634 t confer increased 11β-hsd1 expression and activity, which associates with the metabolic syndrome.
gambit: a parameterless model-based evolutionary algorithm for mixed-integer problems evolution strategies (ess) are powerful probabilistic search and optimization algorithms gleaned from biological evolution theory. they have been successfully applied to a wide range of real world applications. the modern ess are mainly designed for solving continuous parameter optimization problems. their ability to adapt the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution used for mutation during the optimization run makes them well suited for this domain. in this article we describe and study mixed integer evolution strategies (mies), which are natural extensions of es for mixed integer optimization problems. mies can deal with parameter vectors consisting not only of continuous variables but also with nominal discrete and integer variables. following the design principles of the canonical evolution strategies, they use specialized mutation operators tailored for the aforementioned mixed parameter classes. for each type of variable, the choice of mutation operators is governed by a natural metric for this variable type, maximal entropy, and symmetry considerations. all distributions used for mutation can be controlled in their shape by means of scaling parameters, allowing self-adaptation to be implemented. after introducing and motivating the conceptual design of the mies, we study the optimality of the self-adaptation of step sizes and mutation rates on a generalized (weighted) sphere model. moreover, we prove global convergence of the mies on a very general class of problems. the remainder of the article is devoted to performance studies on artificial landscapes (barrier functions and mixed integer nk landscapes), and a case study in the optimization of medical image analysis systems. in addition, we show that with proper constraint handling techniques, mies can also be applied to classical mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
recruitment order of cat abducens motoneurons and internuclear neurons. 1. single neurons in the abducens nucleus were recorded extracellularly in alert rhesus macaques trained to make a variety of eye movements. an abducens neurons was identified as a motoneuron (mn) if its action potentials triggered an averaged emg potential in the lateral rectus muscle. abducens internuclear neurons (inns) that project to the oculomotor nucleus were identified by collision block of spontaneous with antidromic action potentials evoked with a stimulating electrode placed in the medial rectus subdivision of the contralateral oculomotor nucleus. 2. all abducens mns and inns had qualitatively similar discharge patterns consisting of a burst of spikes for lateral saccades and a steady firing whose rate increased with lateral eye position in excess of a certain threshold. 3. for both mns and inns the firing rates associated with different, constant eye positions could be described accurately by a straight line with slope, k (the eye position sensitivity in spikes.s-1.deg-1), and intercept, t (the eye position threshold for steady firing). for different mns, k increased as t varied from more medial to more lateral values. in contrast, the majority of inns already were active for values of t more medial than 20 degrees and showed little evidence of recruitment according to k. 4. during horizontal sinusoidal smooth-pursuit eye movements, both mns and inns exhibited a sinusoidal modulation in firing rate whose peak preceded eye position. from these firing rate patterns, the component of firing rate related to eye velocity, r (the eye velocity sensitivity in spikes.s-1.deg-1.s-1), was determined. the r for inns was, on average, 78% larger than that for mns. furthermore, r increased with t for mns, whereas inns showed no evidence of recruitment according to r. if, as in the cat, the inns of monkeys provide the major input to medial rectus mns and if simian medial rectus mns behave like our abducens mns, then recruitment order, which is absent in inns, must be established at the mn pool itself. 5. unexpectedly, the r of mns decreased with the frequency of the smooth-pursuit movement. furthermore, the eye position sensitivity, k, obtained during steady fixations was usually less than that determined during smooth pursuit. therefore, conclusions about the roles of mns and premotor neurons based on how their r and k values differ must be viewed with caution if the data have been obtained under different tracking conditions.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
panoramic radiography: effects of head alignment on the vertical dimension of the mandibular ramus and condyle region. the objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of panoramic radiographs for diagnosing vertical asymmetry of the posterior mandible. the first part of the study used a model to evaluate the reproducibility of this particular panoramic machine. the tube traverse did not significantly affect the linear measurements, but the side of the machine where the structure was located produced an average of 2.1% variation in the total height of the mandible. in the second part of the study, the left-right (%) differences were measured on the panoramics and the laminographs of five skulls with lead markers. these differences were compared with the percent difference measured directly on the skull and with each other and suggested that the laminograph could be used as the "gold standard" for measuring posterior vertical mandibular asymmetry. the third part of the study evaluated a patient sample (n = 42). the correlation coefficient between the two types of films was determined to be 0.92 for total height and 0.39 for condyle height. using the 6% cutoff reported in the literature, the sensitivity of the panoramics to diagnose asymmetry for the total height was determined to be 0.62 and the specificity 1.0. this study suggests that the panoramic radiograph can be used to evaluate vertical posterior mandibular asymmetry, but there will be some underdiagnosis.
adrenal epinephrine increases alveolar liquid clearance in a canine model of neurogenic pulmonary edema. alveolar and lung liquid clearances were studied over 1, 4, and 6 h in intact anesthetized ventilated rats by instillation of 5% albumin solution with 1.5 microci of 125i-labeled albumin (3 ml/kg into 1 lung or 6 ml/kg into both lungs). alveolar protein clearance as measured by residual 125i-albumin in the lung over 6 h was similar to the slow rates measured in other species. alveolar liquid clearance was estimated by the concentration of albumin in the air spaces. after 1 h, this concentration was 7.8 +/- 0.7 g/dl, which was significantly greater than the initial protein concentration of 5.3 +/- 0.2 g/dl (p < 0.05). amiloride (10(-3) m) inhibited 45% of the basal alveolar liquid clearance, and ouabain (10(-3) m), instilled and intravenously infused (0.004 mg), inhibited 30% of the clearance. beta-adrenergic agonist instillation increased alveolar liquid clearance to the fastest 1-h rate (48 +/- 3% of instilled volume) that we observed in any intact species. the removal of the instilled fluid from the lung (expressed as lung liquid clearance; 0.96 +/- 0.3 ml/h) was twice as fast as the rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance reported in the isolated or in situ rat lung models. the rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance in these intact rats was significantly faster than those in prior studies in dogs and sheep and was similar to the rates in rabbits.
association of television viewing time with body composition and calcified subclinical atherosclerosis in singapore chinese objective both coronary artery calcification (cac) and the ankle brachial index (abi) are measures of subclinical atherosclerotic disease. the influence of physical activity on the longitudinal change in these measures remains unclear. to assess this relation we examined the association between these measures and self-reported physical activity in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (mesa).   methods at baseline, the mesa participants were free of clinically evident cardiovascular disease. we included all participants with an abi between 0.90 and 1.40 (n = 5656). predictor variables were based on self-reported measures with physical activity being assessed using the typical week physical activity survey from which metabolic equivalent-minutes/week of activity were calculated. we focused on physical activity intensity, intentional exercise, sedentary behavior, and conditioning. incident peripheral artery disease (pad) was defined as the progression of abi to values below 0.90 (given the baseline range of 0.90-1.40). incident cac was defined as a cac score >0 agatston units upon follow up with a baseline score of 0 agatston units.   results mean age of participants was 61 years, 53% were female, and mean body mass index was 28 kg/m(2). after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic factors, intentional exercise was protective for incident peripheral artery disease (relative risk (rr) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.74-0.98). after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic factors, there was a significant association between vigorous pa and incident cac (rr = 0.97, 95% ci: 0.94-1.00). there was also a significant association between sedentary behavior and increased amount of cac among participants with cac at baseline (δlog (agatston units + 25) = 0.027, 95% ci 0.002, 0.052).   conclusions these data suggest that there is an association between physical activity/sedentary behavior and the progression of two different measures of subclinical atherosclerotic disease.
trends in aids-defining opportunistic illnesses incidence over 25 years in rio de janeiro, brazil background:the world health organization recommends isoniazid preventive therapy (ipt) for preventing tuberculosis in hiv-infected adults, although few countries have instituted this policy. both ipt and highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) used separately result in reductions in tuberculosis risk. there is less information on the combined effect of ipt and haart. we assessed the effect of ipt, haart or both ipt and haart on tuberculosis incidence in hiv-infected adults in south africa. methods:two clinical cohorts of hiv-infected patients were studied. primary exposures were receipt of ipt and/or haart and the primary outcome was incident tuberculosis. crude incident rates and incident rate ratios were calculated and cox proportional hazards models investigated associations with tuberculosis risk. results:among 2778 hiv-infected patients followed for 4287 person-years, 267 incident tuberculosis cases were diagnosed [incidence rate ratio (irr) = 6.2/100 person-years; 95% ci 5.5–7.0]. for person-time without ipt or haart, the irr was 7.1/100 person-years (95% ci 6.2–8.2); for person-time receiving haart but without ipt, the irr was 4.6/100 person-years (95% ci 3.4–6.2); for person-time after ipt but prior to haart, the irr was 5.2/100 person-years (95% ci 3.4–7.8); during follow-up in patients treated with haart after receiving ipt the irr was 1.1/100 person-years (95% ci 0.02–7.6). compared to treatment-naive patients, haart-only patients had a 64% decreased hazard for tuberculosis [adjusted hazard ratio (ahr) = 0.36; 95% ci 0.25–0.51], and patients receiving haart after ipt had a 89% reduced hazard (ahr = 0.11; 95% ci 0.02–0.78). conclusion:tuberculosis risk is significantly reduced by ipt in haart-treated adults in a high-incidence operational setting in south africa. ipt is an inexpensive and cost-effective strategy and our data strengthen calls for the implementation of ipt in conjunction with the roll-out of haart.
distribution of cb1 cannabinoid receptors in the rat amygdaloid complex cannabinoids are the most popular illicit drugs used for recreational purposes worldwide. however, the neurobiological substrate of their mood-altering capacity has not been elucidated so far. here we report that cb1 cannabinoid receptors are expressed at high levels in certain amygdala nuclei, especially in the lateral and basal nuclei, but are absent in other nuclei (e.g., in the central nucleus and in the medial nucleus). expression of the cb1 protein was restricted to a distinct subpopulation of gabaergic interneurons corresponding to large cholecystokinin-positive cells. detailed electron microscopic investigation revealed that cb1 receptors are located presynaptically on cholecystokinin-positive axon terminals, which establish symmetrical gabaergic synapses with their postsynaptic targets. the physiological consequence of this particular anatomical localization was investigated by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in principal cells of the lateral and basal nuclei. cb1 receptor agonists win 55,212–2 and cp 55,940 reduced the amplitude of gabaa receptor-mediated evoked and spontaneous ipscs, whereas the action potential-independent miniature ipscs were not significantly affected. in contrast, cb1 receptor agonists were ineffective in changing the amplitude of ipscs in the rat central nucleus and in the basal nucleus of cb1 knock-out mice. these results suggest that cannabinoids target specific elements in neuronal networks of given amygdala nuclei, where they presynaptically modulate gabaergic synaptic transmission. we propose that these anatomical and physiological features, characteristic of cb1 receptors in several forebrain regions, represent the neuronal substrate for endocannabinoids involved in retrograde synaptic signaling and may explain some of the emotionally relevant behavioral effects of cannabinoid exposure.
takayasu arteritis and pregnancy: a population‐based study on outcomes and mother/child‐related concerns objectivestakayasu arteritis predominantly affects young women of reproductive age; therefore, the management of pregnancies with this disease is of great importance in clinical obstetrics. however, only a limited number of such cases have been reported in the english literature. our aim in this study was to investigate the clinical features of pregnant women with takayasu arteritis managed at a tertiary center in japan.methodswe conducted a retrospective study of 26 pregnancies (18 deliveries) in 10 women with takayasu arteritis, who were managed at kyushu university hospital between 1996 and 2010. data were collected retrospectively by reviewing the maternal medical records.resultsthe mean age of these patients at delivery was 29.3 ± 5.2 years. six patients had lesions above and below the diaphragm, and four patients showed isolated supradiaphragmatic disease. echocardiography was performed in all patients, and aortic regurgitation was observed in six. five pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortion, and three pregnancies were legally terminated at the patients’ request. the remaining 18 pregnancies resulted in live births. of the 18 live babies born, growth restriction was observed in 2 babies. superimposed pregnancy-induced hypertension was observed in two cases, and other severe complications, such as cerebral hemorrhage or cardiac failure did not occur.conclusionalthough takayasu arteritis is a potentially severe condition during pregnancy, successful pregnancy is possible if extreme caution is followed. blood pressure should be strictly controlled and the delivery should be planned for favorable maternal and fetal outcomes.
identification and expression analysis of two ifn-inducible genes in crucian carp (carassius auratus l.). in mammals, the response to nephrotoxicant-induced renal injury is limited to repair of the proximal tubule by surviving epithelial cells. in contrast, bony fish are capable of both repair, and de novo production of nephrons in response to renal damage. importantly, toxicant-induced nephron neogenesis in goldfish (carassius auratus) parallels nephron development in the mammalian embryo, providing a vertebrate model for kidney development. we utilized this model system to identify genes induced by the renal toxicant, gentamicin, that may function in nephron neogenesis. a novel ubiquitin-like (ubl) gene, 40.1, was identified by differential display analysis of control and gentamicin-treated goldfish kidney. 40.1 was induced dramatically 3-7 days following a sublethal dose of gentamicin, and returned to basal level by 14 days post-treatment. the induction of 40.1 coincided with early renal injury in the proximal tubules of gentamicin-injected fish; however, expression was not restricted to the kidney, suggesting that 40.1 induction may be a more general response to cell injury. sequence analysis revealed that 40.1 contains tandem ubl domains, and shares homology with isg15, a 15 kd interferon-(ifn) stimulated ubl found in mammals. analysis of the genome database for the pufferfish, fugu rubrides, identified a goldfish isg15 (gfisg15) homologue with an ifn-stimulated response element in the promoter region, providing further evidence that gfisg15 is the true teleost isg15 orthologue. zebrafish and catfish isg15 genes were subsequently identified by sequence analysis. consistent with its predicted function as a ubl, gfisg15 formed conjugates with cellular proteins in vitro and in transient transfections. similar to the induction of mammalian isg15 by microbial challenge, gfisg15 was induced in the spleen of mycobacteria-infected fish. these studies identified the first teleost isg15 orthologue. the induction of gfisg15 as an early genetic event in response to a renal toxicant, and its conserved, stress-associated, expression in higher vertebrates suggests that isg15 is an important component of the host response to diverse stress stimuli.
the decomposition rate of non-stem components of coarse woody debris (cwd) in european boreal forests mainly depends on site moisture and tree species the decomposition rates and mass of fine ( 10-cm-diameter) woody detritus were measured in the dry tropical forests of the northeastern yucatan peninsula. the smallest mass of woody detritus was found in undisturbed stands: fine fractions averaged 4.7 mg ha-' and coarse fractions ranged between 13 and 38 mg ha-'. the largest mass of fine woody detritus (32.2 mg ha-') was found in a hurricane-disturbed forest; whereas, the largest mass of coarse woody detritus (99.5 mg ha-') was found in stands disturbed by catastrophic fires. a decomposition time-series study installed in 1989 indicated that decomposition rates varied greatly among species and diameters of branch segments. over a 4-year period, the decomposition rate constant for fine woody detritus ranged from 0.151 to 1.019 year-' and that for coarse woody detritus ranged from 0.008 to 0.615 year-'. the halflife of woody detritus increased 33-fold (among pieces ranging from 1 to 30 cm in diameter) for the most decayresistant species (manilkara zapota) but was relatively constant for the least decay-resistant species (bursera simaruba). the wide range in decomposition rates observed in these forests indicates that the poor substrate quality of some species may override climatic (e.g., warm temperatures) and biotic (e.g., termites) factors favorable to rapid decomposition, leading to a substantial accumulation of woody detritus.
safety, pharmacokinetic, and functional effects of the nogo-a monoclonal antibody in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomized, first-in-human clinical trial background riluzole 100 mg probably prolongs survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by about two months and the safety of the drug is not a major concern. the evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that patients taking riluzole probably survive longer than patients taking placebo. the beneficial effects are very modest and the drug is expensive. adverse effects from riluzole are relatively minor and for the most part reversible after stopping the drug. riluzole has been approved for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in many countries but not all. questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost, modest efficacy and concern over adverse effects.   objectives to examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival.   search strategy search of the cochrane neuromuscular disease group register for randomized trials and enquiry from authors of trials, aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. the most recent search was november 2002.   selection criteria randomized trials of adults with diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), treated with riluzole or placebo. types of outcome measures: primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. secondary: per cent mortality as a function of time with riluzole 100 mg and other doses of riluzole; neurologic function, quality of life, muscle strength and adverse events.   data collection & analysis we identified four eligible randomized trials. each reviewer graded them for methodological quality. data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by two others. we obtained some missing data from investigators and regulatory agencies. we performed meta-analyses with review manager 4.1 software using a fixed effects model. a test of drug efficacy was based on the parmar pooled hazard ratio.   results the three trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 876 riluzole treated patients and 406 placebo treated patients. the data for tracheostomy-free survival was not available from the fourth trial. the methodological quality was acceptable and the three trials were easily comparable, although one trial included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (p=0.039, hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.99) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (p=0.33). when the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) is added, there is evidence of heterogeneity (p<0.0001) and the random effects model, which takes this into account results in the overall treatment effect estimate falling just short of significance (p=0.056, hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.01). this represents a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (57% in the placebo and 66% in the riluzole group). in secondary analyses of survival at separate time points, there was a significant survival advantage with riluzole 100 mg at six, nine, 12 and 15 months, but not at three or 18 months. there was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. there were no data on quality of life, but patients treated with riluzole remained in a more moderately affected health state significantly longer than placebo-treated patients (weighted mean difference 35.5 days, 95% confidence interval 5.9 to 65.0). a threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (weighted mean difference 2.69, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 4.38).   conclusions riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs survival by about two months in patients with als. more studies are needed, especially to clarify its effect in older patients (over 75 years), and those with more advanced disease.
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from reed canary grass in paludiculture: effect of groundwater level northern peatland methane (ch4) budgets are important for global ch4 emissions. this study aims to determine the ecosystem ch4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. annually, roughly 70 ± 35% of ecosystem ch4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, p. arundinacea-mediated ch4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. despite of plant-dominant ch4 transport, net ch4 fluxes were low (– 0.005–0.016 μmol m−2 s−1) and annually less than 1% of the annual c-co2 assimilation. this is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased ch4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. this study shows that although ch4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than co2, is emitted from this p. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the c sequestered counterbalances the ch4 emissions to the atmosphere. it is concluded that p. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive c-sequestration ecosystem.
estrogen and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation have a synergistic hypotriglyceridemic effect in ovariectomized rats non‐technical summary  previous studies show that oestrogen is beneficial for maintaining blood glucose levels and helping the body respond to insulin. despite these previous findings, the mechanism by which oestrogen acts is unknown. we show that specific activation of oestrogen receptor α (erα) increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle when insulin is present. activation of oestrogen receptor β (erβ) alone or activation of both erα and erβ together did not increase glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. this suggests that oestrogen's beneficial effect occurs by activating erα. these results have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of glucose homeostasis, particularly in postmenopausal women with low oestrogen levels.
differential role of gabaa receptors and neuroligin 2 for perisomatic gabaergic synapse formation in the hippocampus synaptic scaffolding molecule (s‐scam) is a synaptic protein, which harbors five or six psd‐95/discs large/zo‐1 (pdz), a guanylate kinase and two ww domains. it interacts with nmda receptor subunits, neuroligin and β‐catenin, and is involved in the accumulation of neuroligin at excitatory synapses. in this study, we have demonstrated s‐scam is localized at inhibitory synapses in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons. we have identified β‐dystroglycan (β‐dg) as a binding partner for s‐scam at inhibitory synapses. ww domains of s‐scam bind to three sequences of β‐dg. we have also revealed that s‐scam can interact with neuroligin 2, which is known to be exclusively localized at inhibitory synapses. the ww domains and the second pdz domain of s‐scam are involved in the interaction with neuroligin 2. β‐dg, neuroligin 2 and s‐scam form a tripartite complex in vitro. neuroligin 2 is detected in the immunoprecipitates by anti‐β‐dg antibody from rat brain. s‐scam, β‐dg and neuroligin 2 are partially co‐localized in rat hippocampal neurons. these data suggest that s‐scam is associated with β‐dg and neuroligin 2 at inhibitory synapses, and functions as a linker between the dystrophin glycoprotein complex and the neurexin–neuroligin complex.
the importance of human population characteristics in modeling aedes aegypti distributions and assessing risk of mosquito-borne infectious diseases abstract   after more than a half century without recognized local dengue outbreaks in the continental united states, there were recent outbreaks of autochthonous dengue in the southern parts of texas (2004–2005) and florida (2009–2011). this dengue reemergence has provoked interest in the extent of the future threat posed by the yellow fever mosquito, aedes (stegomyia) aegypti (l.), the primary vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses in urban settings, to human health in the continental united states. ae. aegypti is an intriguing example of a vector species that not only occurs in the southernmost portions of the eastern united states today but also is incriminated as the likely primary vector in historical outbreaks of yellow fever as far north as new york, philadelphia, and boston, from the 1690s to the 1820s. for vector species with geographic ranges limited, in part, by low temperature and cool range margins occurring in the southern part of the continental united states, as is currently the case for ae. aegypti, it is tempting to speculate that climate warming may result in a northward range expansion (similar to that seen for ixodes tick vectors of lyme borreliosis spirochetes in scandinavia and southern canada in recent decades). although there is no doubt that climate conditions directly impact many aspects of the life history of ae. aegypti, this mosquito also is closely linked to the human environment and directly influenced by the availability of water-holding containers for oviposition and larval development. competition with other container-inhabiting mosquito species, particularly aedes (stegomyia) albopictus (skuse), also may impact the presence and local abundance of ae. aegypti. field-based studies that focus solely on the impact of weather or climate factors on the presence and abundance of ae. aegypti, including assessments of the potential impact of climate warming on the mosquito's future range and abundance, do not consider the potential confounding effects of socioeconomic factors or biological competitors for establishment and proliferation of ae. aegypti. the results of such studies therefore should not be assumed to apply in areas with different socioeconomic conditions or composition of container-inhabiting mosquito species. for example, results from field-based studies at the high altitude cool margins for ae. aegypti in mexico's central highlands or the andes in south america cannot be assumed to be directly applicable to geographic areas in the united states with comparable climate conditions. unfortunately, we have a very poor understanding of how climatic drivers interact with the human landscape and biological competitors to impact establishment and proliferation of ae. aegypti at the cool margin of its range in the continental united states. a first step toward assessing the future threat this mosquito poses to human health in the continental united states is to design and conduct studies across strategic climatic and socioeconomic gradients in the united states (including the u.s.-mexico border area) to determine the permissiveness of the coupled natural and human environment for ae. aegypti at the present time. this approach will require experimental studies and field surveys that focus specifically on climate conditions relevant to the continental united states. these studies also must include assessments of how the human landscape, particularly the impact of availability of larval developmental sites and the permissiveness of homes for mosquito intrusion, and the presence of other container-inhabiting mosquitoes that may compete with ae. aegypti for larval habitat affects the ability of ae. aegypti to establish and proliferate. until we are armed with such knowledge, it is not possible to meaningfully assess the potential for climate warming to impact the proliferation potential for ae. aegypti in the united states outside of the geographic areas where the mosquito already is firmly established, and even less so for dengue virus transmission and dengue disease in humans.
evidence for the involvement of camkii and ampk in ca2+-dependent signaling pathways regulating fa uptake and oxidation in contracting rodent muscle. intramuscular triacylglycerol is an important energy store and is also related to insulin resistance. the mobilization of fatty acids from this pool is probably regulated by hormone-sensitive lipase (hsl), which has recently been shown to exist in muscle and to be activated by both adrenaline and contractions. adrenaline acts via camp-dependent protein kinase (pka). the signalling mediating the effect of contractions is unknown and was explored in this study. incubated soleus muscles from 70 g male rats were electrically stimulated to perform repeated tetanic contractions for 5 min. the contraction-induced activation of hsl was abolished by the protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide i and calphostin c and reduced 50% by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor u0126, which also completely blocked extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1 and 2 phosphorylation. none of the inhibitors reduced adrenaline-induced hsl activation in soleus muscle. both phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (pma), which activates pkc and, in turn, erk, and caffeine, which increases intracellular ca2+ without eliciting contraction, increased hsl activity. activated erk increased hsl activity in supernatant from basal but not from electrically stimulated muscle. in conclusion, in muscle, pkc can stimulate hsl through erk. contractions and adrenaline enhance muscle hsl activity by different signalling mechanisms. the effect of contractions is mediated by pkc, at least partly via the erk pathway.
genus-wide comparative genomics of malassezia delineates its phylogeny, physiology, and niche adaptation on human skin ustilaginomycotina (basidiomycota, fungi) has been reclassified recently based on multiple gene sequence analyses. however, the phylogenetic placement of two yeast-like genera malassezia and moniliella in the subphylum remains unclear. phylogenetic analyses using different algorithms based on the sequences of six genes, including the small subunit (18s) ribosomal dna (rdna), the large subunit (26s) rdna d1/d2 domains, the internal transcribed spacer regions (its 1 and 2) including 5.8s rdna, the two subunits of rna polymerase ii (rpb1 and rpb2) and the translation elongation factor 1-α (ef1-α), were performed to address their phylogenetic positions. our analyses indicated that malassezia and moniliella represented two deeply rooted lineages within ustilaginomycotina and have a sister relationship to both ustilaginomycetes and exobasidiomycetes. those clades are described here as new classes, namely moniliellomycetes with order moniliellales, family moniliellaceae, and genus moniliella; and malasseziomycetes with order malasseziales, family malasseziaceae, and genus malassezia. phenotypic differences support this classification suggesting widely different life styles among the mainly plant pathogenic ustilaginomycotina.
electroencephalographic characteristics of cognitive-specific alerting attention in verbal learning: iii. localized characteristics of eeg spatial synchronization electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 subjects (students) in states of: rest with the eyes open; memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (latin and russian); and recollection (control) of the memorized information. estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared using statistical methods for the frequency bands θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ. the results of this comparison showed that transition from the state of rest to those of memorization and recollection was accompanied by numerous changes in coherence in all the frequency bands. these changes varied in intensity and embrace practically the entire convexital cerebral cortex. decrease in eeg coherence was predominant during the transition to the memorization state in various frequency bands, whereas during the transition from the rest state to that of recollection, eeg coherence increased in most of the frequency bands except for the band α2. the reproducibility of this pattern of changes in eeg coherence is confirmed by the results in the subgroups formed by randomly subdividing the subjects into two groups. we think that the observed intense rearrangement of the spatial synchronization of the cortex electrical activity reflects the reorganization of the functional systems of neuronal ensembles to provide efficient memorization and recollection, respectively.

between-trial inhibition and facilitation in goal-directed aiming: manual and spatial asymmetries consistent with action–based theories of attention, the presence of a nontarget stimulus in the environment has been shown to alter the characteristics of goal–directed movements. specifically, it has been reported that movement trajectories veer away from (howard & tipper, 1997) or towards (welsh, elliott, & weeks, 1999) the location of a nontarget stimulus. the purpose of the experiments reported in this paper was to test a response activation model of selective reaching conceived to account for these variable results. in agreement with the model, the trajectory changes in the movements appear to be determined by the activation levels of each competing response at the moment of response initiation. the results of the present work, as well as those of previous studies, are discussed within the framework of the model of response activation.
driver drowsiness monitoring using eye movement features derived from electrooculography in this work, we investigate eye movement analysis as a new sensing modality for activity recognition. eye movement data were recorded using an electrooculography (eog) system. we first describe and evaluate algorithms for detecting three eye movement characteristics from eog signals-saccades, fixations, and blinks-and propose a method for assessing repetitive patterns of eye movements. we then devise 90 different features based on these characteristics and select a subset of them using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mrmr) feature selection. we validate the method using an eight participant study in an office environment using an example set of five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking handwritten notes, watching a video, and browsing the web. we also include periods with no specific activity (the null class). using a support vector machine (svm) classifier and person-independent (leave-one-person-out) training, we obtain an average precision of 76.1 percent and recall of 70.5 percent over all classes and participants. the work demonstrates the promise of eye-based activity recognition (ear) and opens up discussion on the wider applicability of ear to other activities that are difficult, or even impossible, to detect using common sensing modalities.
influence of host plant-derived and abiotic environmental parameters on the composition of the diazotroph assemblage associated with roots of juncus roemerianus the degree of host specificity of most plant root associated bacteria is poorly under- stood. in this study we examined the physiological diversity of oxygen utilizing, culturable dia- zotrophs from the rhizoplane of the high marsh perennial glasswort salicornia virginica and com- pared them to diazotrophs from other salt marsh plants (tall and short spartina alterniflora, juncus roemerianus, and spartina patens) from the same ecosystem. forty-six pure culture strains were recovered from the rhizoplane of s. virginica by stab inoculating freshly collected roots into com- bined nitrogen-free semi-solid media, followed by streak plating of clonal outgrowths. the majority of these strains were gram-negative obligately aerobic or microaerophilic rods, but 3 gram-positive strains were also isolated and characterized. api 20ne test strips were used for preliminary charac- terization of all strains, yielding 22 physiologically different api strain groups. one representative strain was selected from each api group and tested for the presence of nifh, denoting strains capa- ble of n2-fixation. seventeen strains (14 gram-negative, 3 gram-positive) were nifh-positive and were characterized further using biolog test plates. four well-supported strain clusters were iden- tified by bootstrapped cluster analysis of the biolog substrate utilization profiles. these clusters differed in utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and amino acids. s. virginica diazotrophs were physiologically quite different from rhizoplane diazotrophs from the low marsh plants s. alterni- flora and j. roemerianus, but much more similar to diazotrophs from another high marsh plant, s. patens. we hypothesize that the observed physiological differentiation between high marsh and low marsh diazotrophs reflects differences in selection pressures in the rhizoplane microenvironment produced by plants with differing abilities to ventilate the rhizosphere. in addition, high and low marsh branches were further resolved into host-specific strain clusters, which also implies a strong impact of other host features, such as the suite of carbon exudate compounds produced, on the dis- tributions of specific diazotroph strains. these findings imply endemic, host-specific distributions of salt marsh diazotrophs and are consistent with the great diversity of diazotrophs that have been observed in this ecosystem to date.
utility of a power aspiration-based extraction technique as an initial and secondary approach in the treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolism: results of the multicenter prism trial. background recent controlled trials suggest that thrombolytic therapy may be an effective initial treatment for acute arterial occlusion of the legs. a major potential benefit of initial thrombolytic therapy is that limb ischemia can be managed with less invasive interventions.   methods in this randomized, multicenter trial conducted at 113 north american and european sites, we compared vascular surgery (e.g., thrombectomy or bypass surgery) with thrombolysis by catheter-directed intraarterial recombinant urokinase; all patients (272 per group) had had acute arterial obstruction of the legs for 14 days or less. infusions were limited to a period of 48 hours (mean [+/-se], 24.4+/-0.86), after which lesions were corrected by surgery or angioplasty if needed. the primary end point was the amputation-free survival rate at six months.   results final angiograms, which were available for 246 patients treated with urokinase, revealed recanalization in 196 (79.7 percent) and complete dissolution of thrombus in 167 (67.9 percent). both treatment groups had similar significant improvements in mean ankle-brachial blood-pressure index. amputation-free survival rates in the urokinase group were 71.8 percent at six months and 65.0 percent at one year, as compared with respective rates of 74.8 percent and 69.9 percent in the surgery group; the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences were -10.5 to 4.5 percentage points at six months (p=0.43) and -12.9 to 3.1 percentage points at one year (p=0.23). at six months the surgery group had undergone 551 open operative procedures (excluding amputations), as compared with 315 in the thrombolysis group. major hemorrhage occurred in 32 patients in the urokinase group (12.5 percent) as compared with 14 patients in the surgery group (5.5 percent) (p= 0.005). there were four episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the urokinase group (1.6 percent), one of which was fatal. by contrast, there were no episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the surgery group.   conclusions despite its association with a higher frequency of hemorrhagic complications, intraarterial infusion of urokinase reduced the need for open surgical procedures, with no significantly increased risk of amputation or death.
awakening sleeping beauty: production of propionic acid in escherichia coli through the sbm operon requires the activity of a methylmalonyl-coa epimerase pantothenate kinase catalyzes the rate-controlling step in the coenzyme a (coa) biosynthetic pathway, and its activity is modulated by the size of the coa pool. the effect of nonesterified coa (coash) and coa thioesters on the activity of pantothenate kinase was examined to determine which component of the coa pool is the most effective regulator of the enzyme from escherichia coli. coash was five times more potent than acetyl-coa or other coa thioesters as an inhibitor of pantothenate kinase activity in vitro. inhibition by coa thioesters was not due to their hydrolysis to coash. coash inhibition was competitive with respect to atp, thus providing a mechanism to coordinate coa production with the energy state of the cell. there were considerable differences in the size and composition of the coa pool in cells grown on different carbon sources, and a carbon source shift experiment was used to test the inhibitory effect of the different coa species in vivo. a shift from glucose to acetate as the carbon source resulted in an increase in the coash:acetyl-coa ratio from 0.7 to 4.3. the alteration in the coa pool composition was associated with the selective inhibition of pantothenate phosphorylation, consistent with coash being a more potent regulator of pantothenate kinase activity in vivo. these results demonstrate that coa biosynthesis is regulated through feedback inhibition of pantothenate kinase primarily by the concentration of coash and secondarily by the size of the coa thioester pool.
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: early predictors of prolonged survival the scottish motor neuron disease register (smndr) is a prospective, collaborative, population-based project which has been collecting data on incident patients since 1989. in this report we present the clinical features of 229 patients with motor neuron disease (218 sporadic and 11 familial) diagnosed in 1989 and 1990 and compare their prognosis with previous studies of survival. the overall 50% survival from symptom onset was 2.5 years (95% ci, 2.2–3.0) and 5-year survival 28% (95% cl, 20–36%). the presence of progressive bulbar palsy (pbp), either at presentation or developing during the course of the illness, significantly reduced survival and was the most important prognostic indicator. patients who survived longer than 5 years from symptom onset did not have bp as part of their presenting illness. the prognosis was worse for women, and this was in part related to the higher frequency of pbp in older women, but age was also an independent adverse risk factor. differences in survival between this and previous series can probably be explained on the basis of variation in case definition and ascertainment methods.
delta frequency optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic nucleus reuniens is sufficient to produce working memory deficits: relevance to schizophrenia phencyclidine (pcp), ketamine (special k), and mk-801 are noncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonists that produce acute psychosis in humans. the psychosis produced by these psychomimetic drugs is indistinguishable from schizophrenia and includes both positive and negative symptoms. this drug-induced psychosis occurs after puberty in humans. on the basis of the mk-801-induced spike-and-wave activity in rats and increased blood flow and metabolism in brain of patients with psychosis caused by these psychomimetics, this brief review argues that this psychosis is an atypical form of limbic epilepsy. moreover, there is a specific limbic thalamcortical psychosis circuit that mediates cell injury in limbic cortex of rodents and may mediate this pcp-induced psychosis in humans. it is proposed that this thalamocortical psychosis circuit develops at puberty and can mediate pcp and ketamine-mediated psychosis and possibly the psychosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disease and other disorders that have their onset at puberty. finally, based on this developmentally regulated psychosis/epilepsy-related thalamocortical circuitry, it is proposed that antiepileptic drugs that promote gabaergic mechanisms may decrease the probability of episodic psychosis from any cause.
effects of different doses of letrozole on the incidence of early-onset ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after oocyte retrieval objective to investigate the effect of letrozole-an oral aromatase inhibitor-on e(2), p, and lh levels when administered during the luteal phase after oocyte retrieval in ivf/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi) cycles.   design prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial.   setting university-affiliated private reproductive medicine center.   patient(s) thirty oocyte donors undergoing standardized controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (coh) protocols.   intervention(s) patients were randomized after successful egg retrieval to receive either 2.5 mg of letrozole (femara; novartis, barcelona, spain) or a placebo (folic acid tablets). all donors were under intrauterine device (iud) contraception.   main outcome measure(s) serum e(2), p, and lh the day of hcg administration and days +4, +7 and +10 after ovum pick-up.   result(s) donors had a comparable serum e(2) level on the day of hcg administration (1,858 vs. 2,143 pg/ml). interestingly, levels dramatically dropped 4 days after egg retrieval, reaching a statistically significant lower level in those receiving letrozole (279 vs. 1,586 pg/ml). again, at the next time points serum e(2) levels were significantly lower (day +7: 240 vs. 855 pg/ml and day +10: 40 vs. 448 pg/ml). no significant differences were observed in p levels, but lh serum concentrations were lower in the control group on day +7 (0.18 vs. 0.02 miu/ml and day +10 (0.40 vs. 0.16 miu/ml), when serum e(2) levels were higher.   conclusion(s) the administration of 2.5 mg of letrozole during the luteal phase has an impact on corpus luteum (cl) function. it reduces serum e(2) levels, which allows a faster recovery of lh concentration. this may be of interest not only for egg donors, but also in patients at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) who freeze all their embryos or who cancel hcg administration to reduce the potential risk that high e(2) levels pose.
characterization of ca2+ channels and g proteins involved in arachidonic acid release by endothelin-1/endothelina receptor. the present study investigates whether endothelin-1 (et-1), like noradrenaline (na), stimulates the release of arachidonic acid (aa) via cytosolic phospholipase a2 (cpla2) in rat tail artery. in tail artery segments labelled with [3h]aa, et-1-induced aa release in a concentration-dependent manner with an ec50 of 1.3 nm. the effect of et-1 was inhibited by bosentan and was insensitive to bq788, suggesting the involvement of eta receptor. the stimulation of aa release induced by et-1 was prevented by arachydonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (aacocf3), a selective inhibitor of cpla2 and not by rhc80267, a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor. furthermore, pd98059, inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) cascade and calphostin c, a protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor, prevented the stimulation of aa release induced by et-1 and na. immunoblotting of the cytosolic fraction of rat tail arteries stimulated with et-1 or na showed an increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erks) phosphorylation and this effect was abolished by calphostin c treatment. these findings show that in rat tail artery et-1 and na induce a sequential activation of protein kinase c and extracellular signal-regulated kinases that results in stimulation of aa release via cpla2 activation. this may represent a general pathway by which g-proteins coupled receptors stimulate aa release and its metabolites in vascular smooth muscle.
oral contraceptive use, reproductive factors, and colorectal cancer risk: findings from wisconsin in los angeles county, the age-adjusted incidence rate of colon cancer in men is almost 30% higher than that in women; however, in the descending and sigmoid colon, age-specific incidence rates for women are higher than those for men before age 55. since menstrual and/or reproductive factors may be involved in producing this crossover in age-specific rates, they were examined in a population-based case-control study involving 327 white women with adenocarcinoma of the colon and age-, race- and neighbourhood-matched controls. after adjustment for other factors associated with colon cancer in this study (family history of large bowel cancer, total fat intake, calcium, weight and activity level), ever having been pregnant was protective (rr = 0.56, 95% ci = 0.33-0.97). for one to two pregnancies, the rr was 0.76 (ci = 0.42-1.37); for three or more pregnancies, the rr was 0.45 (ci = 0.25-0.81). however, the relationship between the number of pregnancies and colon cancer risk was actually u-shaped, with risk decreasing with successive pregnancies up to four and then increasing with additional pregnancies. the u-shaped relationship was present for incomplete as well as for full-term pregnancies and was more striking for cancers occurring in the distal (descending and sigmoid) than proximal (caecum to splenic flexure) colon. risk was not related to age at menarche or use of exogenous oestrogens, but delayed natural menopause was weakly protective in the proximal but not distal colon. the crossover in incidence rates in the distal colon can be completely accounted for by the pregnancy effect. the u-shape of the pregnancy curve suggests the possibility of competing factors, some protective, especially after one or several pregnancies, and others conferring increasing risk with successive pregnancies, regardless of the pregnancy outcome.
mediators of sexual revictimization risk in adult sexual assault victims objective the current study examined emotion dysregulation as a mechanism underlying risky sexual behavior and sexual revictimization among adult victims of child sexual abuse (csa) and child physical abuse (cpa).   methods participants were 752 college women. victimization history, emotion dysregulation, and risky sexual behavior were assessed with anonymous, self-report surveys utilizing a cross-sectional design.   results approximately 6.3% of participants reported csa, 25.5% reported cpa, and 17.8% reported rape during adolescence or adulthood. csa and cpa were associated with increased risk for adolescent/adult rape; 29.8% of csa victims and 24.3% of cpa victims were revictimized. path analytic models tested hypothesized relationships among child abuse, emotion dysregulation, adolescent/adult rape and three forms of risky sexual behavior (e.g., failure to use condoms, contraception, or having sex with someone under the influence of alcohol/drugs), including frequency of risky sexual behavior with a regular dating partner, with a stranger, and lifetime number of intercourse partners. emotion dysregulation mediated revictimization for both csa and cpa. emotion dysregulation also predicted lifetime number of sexual partners and frequency of risky sex with a stranger, but not frequency of risky sex with a regular dating partner.   conclusions findings suggest that emotion dysregulation is a distal predictor, and risky sex, particularly with lesser known partners, is a proximal predictor of sexual revictimization. because emotion dysregulation also maintained a significant direct path to revictimization, risky sexual behavior appears to be one of several proximal risk factors for revictimization.   practice implications findings confirm that emotion dysregulation is a critical pathway to more proximal risk factors such as risky sexual behavior, and suggest that clinical interventions aimed at improving emotion dysregulation may help reduce risky sexual behavior and risk for revictimization.
gustatory neural responses to umami taste stimuli in c57bl/6byj and 129p3/j mice. inhibitory effects of amiloride on salt responses of the chorda tympani nerve and its temperature dependency were compared among three inbred strains of mice (c57bl, balb and 129). in c57bl mice, lingual treatment with amiloride significantly suppressed responses to 0.1-1.0 m nacl at two different temperatures, 24 +/- 2 degrees c and 12 +/- 2 degrees c. the magnitude of the amiloride-inhibited component of nacl response was slightly larger at the higher temperature. in contrast, in balb mice, amiloride suppression of nacl responses was observed only at the lower temperature. no such suppression was exhibited by 129 mice at either temperature levels. these results suggest that there exist at least two different amiloride-sensitive receptor components for nacl in mice: one is more sensitive to nacl at the higher temperature, and the other is more sensitive at the lower temperature. it is hypothesized, c57bl mice possess the former (or both) component(s), whereas balb mice have the latter one. the 129 strain may be lacking both components.
corruption, networking and foreign ownership: recent evidence from cee countries this paper studies the joint impact of corruption on the entry mode and volume of inward foreign direct investment (fdi) using a unique firm-level data set. we find that corruption not only reduces inward fdi, but also shifts the ownership structure towards joint ventures. the latter finding supports the view that corruption increases the value of using a local partner to cut through the bureaucratic maze. however, r&d intensive firms are found to favor sole ownership.
il-27 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenic factor production in a stat1-dominant pathway in human non-small cell lung cancer interferon-γ (ifnγ) is a pluripotent cytokine whose major biological effects are mediated through a pathway in which stat1 is the predominant and essential transcription factor. stat3 can also be activated weakly by ifnγ, but the mechanism of activation and function of stat3 as a part of the interferon response are not known. here we show that stat3 activation is much stronger and more prolonged in stat1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts than in wild-type cells. in response to ifnγ, src-family kinases are required to activate stat3 (but not stat1) through tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the receptor-bound kinases jak1 and jak2 are required to activate both stats. tyrosine 419 of the ifnγ receptor subunit 1 (ifngr1) is required to activate both stats, suggesting that stat1 and stat3 compete with each other for the same receptor phosphotyrosine motif. activated stat3 can replace stat1 in stat1-null cells to drive the transcription of certain genes, for example, socs-3 and c/ebpδ, which have γ-activated sequence motifs in their promoters. work from ian kerr's laboratory reveals that the gp130-linked interleukin-6 receptor, which usually activates stat3 predominantly, activates stat1 efficiently when stat3 is absent (costa-pereira, a. p., tininini, s., strobl, b., alonzi, t., schlaak, j. f., is'harc, h., gesualdo, i., newman, s. j., kerr, i. m., and poli, v. (2002) proc. natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 99, 8043–8047). because stat1 and stat3 have opposing biological effects (stat3 is an oncogene, and stat1 is a tumor suppressor), the reciprocal activation of these two transcription factors in response to ifnγ or interleukin-6 suggests that their relative abundance, which may vary substantially in different normal cell types, under different conditions or in tumors is likely to have a major impact on how cells behave in response to different cytokines.
the carcinogenicity of diethylstilbestrol: structural evidence for a non-genotoxic mechanism an analysis of the chemical structure of tamoxifen, toremifene and their metabolites indicates that metabolism to a dna-reactive hydroxylamine intermediate is possible. the parent compounds and many of their metabolites are predicted to be rodent carcinogens. moreover, many of these metabolites contain a 6 a or 8.4 a distance descriptor biphore. these geometric descriptors may be related to an ability of these chemicals to bind to an estrogen receptor. the prediction of the carcinogenicity of toremifene is not in accord with studies published thus far. however, the reports available have not excluded this possibility, since the protocols used have not addressed it systematically.
impulsive action but not impulsive choice determines problem gambling severity research and clinical expertise indicates that impulsivity is an underlying feature of pathological gambling. this study examined the extent to which impulsive behavior, defined by the rate of discounting delayed monetary rewards, varies with pathological gambling severity, assessed by the south oaks gambling screen (sogs). sixty-two pathological gamblers completed a delay discounting task, the sogs, the eysenck impulsivity scale, the addiction severity index (asi), and questions about gambling and substance use at intake to outpatient treatment for pathological gambling. in the delay discounting task, participants chose between a large delayed reward (us $1000) and smaller more immediate rewards (us $1-$999) across a range of delays (6h to 25 years). the rate at which the delayed reward was discounted (k value) was derived for each participant and linear regression was used to identify the variables that predicted k values. age, gender, years of education, substance abuse treatment history, and cigarette smoking history failed to significantly predict k values. scores on the eysenck impulsivity scale and the sogs both accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in k values. the predictive value of the sogs was 1.4 times that of the eysenck scale. these results indicate that of the measures tested, gambling severity was the best single predictor of impulsive behavior in a delay discounting task in this sample of pathological gamblers.
structured mrna induces the ribosome into a hyper‐rotated state during the elongation cycle, trna and mrna undergo coupled translocation through the ribosome catalyzed by elongation factor g (ef-g). cryo-em reconstructions of certain ef-g-containing complexes led to the proposal that the mechanism of translocation involves rotational movement between the two ribosomal subunits. here, using single-molecule fret, we observe that pretranslocation ribosomes undergo spontaneous intersubunit rotational movement in the absence of ef-g, fluctuating between two conformations corresponding to the classical and hybrid states of the translocational cycle. in contrast, posttranslocation ribosomes are fixed predominantly in the classical, nonrotated state. movement of the acceptor stem of deacylated trna into the 50s e site and ef-g binding to the ribosome both contribute to stabilization of the rotated, hybrid state. furthermore, the acylation state of p site trna has a dramatic effect on the frequency of intersubunit rotation. our results provide direct evidence that the intersubunit rotation that underlies ribosomal translocation is thermally driven.
user-determined end of net life in senegal: a qualitative assessment of decision-making related to the retirement of expired nets backgroundthe timor-leste ministry of health has recently finalized the national malaria control strategy for 2010-2020. a key component of this roadmap is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (llins) in support of achieving the primary goal of reducing both morbidity and mortality from malaria by 30% in the first three years, followed by a further reduction of 20% by end of the programme cycle in 2020 [1]. the strategic plan calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education and communication (iec) programme; however, there is limited prior research into household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted, effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials.methodsnine separate focus group discussions (fgds) were carried out in dili, manatuto, and covalima districts, democratic republic of timor-leste, in july 2010.these focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households with at least one net. comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source analysis software.resultsthe primary determinants of net usage were a widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a limited number of nets within households. both nuisance biting and disease prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while seasonality was not a significant factor. long-term net durability and ease of hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. very frequent washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. finally, extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household.conclusionsemphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on malaria control efforts in timor-leste, as the country's programmes make progress towards universal net coverage.
microrna expression in abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue is associated with mrna expression levels and partly genetically driven micrornas (mirnas) are a novel group of universally present small non-coding rnas that have been implicated in wide ranging physiological processes and thereby are critical in the manifestation of diverse diseases. since their discovery as developmental regulators in c.elegans, they have come a long way and are currently associated with normal and diverse pathophysiological states including parkinson’s syndrome, cardiac hypertrophy, viral infection, diabetes and several types of cancer. of special significance is their involvement in diabetes, an area in which several emerging reports point to the fact that these small rna species could be special and critical in this complex disease and they or their specific inhibitors may be exploited as targets for therapeutic intervention. the stable nature of these mirnas over mrnas is an added advantage of them being projected for the same. this review focuses on and discusses the current diabetic epidemic and the potential role(s) of these mirnas in various physiological processes that lead to the diabetic phenotype with an objective of better understanding the emerging mechanisms of these small molecules in the development and progression of diabetes and its complications.
prevalence and risk factors for recovery of filamentous fungi in individuals with cystic fibrosis. summary aspergillus fumigatus is often found in the respiratory tract secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), although the role of the fungus for progression of pulmonary disease remains unclear. this study aimed to investigate the frequency of a. fumigatus and other fungi in sputum of adult cf patients using different methods for culture and microscopy. results from the analysis of 369 samples from 94 patients showed that a. fumigatus could be isolated in 45.7% of patients. other moulds were rare, but the yeast candida albicans was another frequent isolate, detected in 75.5% of patients. a comparison of different culture media showed no difference between a selective medium developed to specifically inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa and a standard fungal culture medium for growth of a. fumigatus, although both were more efficient for detection of fungi than other bacterial culture media. fluorescent microscopy with calcofluor white was more sensitive for detection of fungal hyphae in undiluted sputum than standard methylene blue staining. this study shows that a. fumigatus and c. albicans have a high frequency in adult cf patients. microbiological analysis should routinely include methods for specific identification of fungi to monitor for potential complications arising from fungal disease in these patients.
subdigital setae of chameleon feet: friction-enhancing microstructures for a wide range of substrate roughness the striking morphological convergence of hair-like integumentary derivatives of lizards and arthropods (spiders and insects) demonstrates the importance of such features for enhancing purchase on the locomotor substrate. these pilose structures are responsible for the unique tractive abilities of these groups of animals, enabling them to move with seeming ease on overhanging and inverted surfaces, and to traverse inclined smooth substrates. three groups of lizards are well known for bearing adhesion-promoting setae on their digits: geckos, anoles and skinks. similar features are also found on the ventral subdigital and distal caudal skin of chameleons. these have only recently been described in any detail, and structurally and functionally are much less well understood than are the setae of geckos and anoles. the seta-like structures of chameleons are not branched (a characteristic of many geckos), nor do they terminate in spatulate tips (which is characteristic of geckos, anoles and skinks). they are densely packed and have attenuated blunt, globose tips or broad, blade-like shafts that are flattened for much of their length. using a force transducer, we tested the hypothesis that these structures enhance friction and demonstrate that the pilose skin has a greater frictional coefficient than does the smooth skin of these animals. our results are consistent with friction being generated as a result of side contact of the integumentary filaments. we discuss the evolutionary and functional implications of these seta-like structures in comparison with those typical of other lizard groups and with the properties of seta-mimicking synthetic structures.
simplified technique of radioguided occult lesion localization (roll) plus sentinel lymph node biopsy (snoll) in breast carcinoma background the objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of radio-guided occult lesion localization (roll) in breast-conserving surgery for nonpalpable breast cancer.   methods altogether 215 breast cancer patients were included in a prospective study. ultrasonographically guided intratumoral injection of radioactive tracer was used for tumor localization in 64 patients with nonpalpable tumors, visible in breast ultrasonography (the roll group). nonpalpable tumors, visible only in mammography, were localized with a help of a guidewire in 14 patients (the wgr group). the remaining 137 patients had palpable tumors.   results the proportion of specimens with close or involved margins (0 to 3 mm) was the same in the roll group (6%) and among cases with palpable tumors (5%). in addition the median length of the closest margin did not differ significantly between the groups.   conclusions the results of roll for nonpalpable breast cancer are comparable with those for resection of palpable tumors.
intrathoracic tracheal volume and collapsibility on inspiratory and end-expiratory ct scans correlations with lung volume and pulmonary function in 85 smokers. purpose to assess forced expiratory tracheal collapsibility in healthy volunteers by using multidetector computed tomography and to compare the results with the current diagnostic criterion for tracheomalacia.   materials and methods an institutional review board approved this hipaa-compliant study. after informed consent was obtained, 51 healthy volunteers (age range, 25-75 years) with normal spirometry results and no history of smoking or risk factors for tracheomalacia were prospectively studied. volunteers were imaged with a 64-detector row scanner, with spirometric monitoring at total lung capacity and during forced exhalation, with 40 mas, 120 kvp, and 0.625-mm detector collimation. cross-sectional area and sagittal and coronal diameters of the trachea were measured 1 cm above the aortic arch and 1 cm above the carina. the percentage of expiratory collapse, the reduction in sagittal and coronal diameters, and the number of participants exceeding the current diagnostic criterion (>50% expiratory reduction in cross-sectional area) for tracheomalacia were calculated.   results the final study population included 25 men and 26 women (mean age, 50 years). the mean percentage of expiratory reduction in tracheal lumen cross-sectional area was 54.34% +/- 18.6 (standard deviation) in the upper trachea and 56.14% +/- 19.3 in the lower trachea. forty (78%) participants exceeded the current diagnostic criterion for tracheomalacia in the upper and/or lower trachea. decreases in cross-sectional area of the upper and lower trachea correlated well with decreases in sagittal (r = 0.807 and 0.688, respectively) and coronal (r = 0.779 and 0.751, respectively) diameters (p < .001 for each correlation).   conclusion healthy volunteers demonstrate a wide range of forced expiratory tracheal collapse, frequently exceeding the current diagnostic criterion for tracheomalacia.
priorities for future iarc monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans. catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) inactivates catecholamines and catechol drugs such as l-dopa. a common genetic polymorphism in humans is associated with a three-to-four-fold variation in comt enzyme activity and is also associated with individual variation in comt thermal instability. we now show that this is due to g-->a transition at codon 158 of the comt gene that results in a valine to methionine substitution. the two alleles can be identified with a pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using the restriction enzyme nla iii. the identification of a gentic marker associated with significant alterations in enzyme activity will facilitate the analysis of a possible role for the comt gene in neuropsychiatric conditions in which abnormalities in catecholamine neurotransmission are believed to occur, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. in addition, this polymorphism may have pharmacogenetic significance in that it will help make it possible to identify patients who display altered metabolism of catechol drugs.
childhood-onset diabetes and the risk of retinopathy 20 years later short running title : ketoacidosis at diagnosis and diabetic retinopathy context although residual beta-cell function delays the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 1 diabetes, the rate of beta-cell destruction is variable.   objective the aim of the study was to clarify the influence of the rate of beta-cell destruction on the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.   design we performed a historical cohort study regarding residual beta-cell function and retinopathy.   setting the study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of a general hospital.   patients a total of 254 patients with type 1 diabetes participated.   main outcome measures serum c-peptide and fundus findings were evaluated longitudinally.   results the cumulative incidence of mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy was higher in the patients without detectable beta-cell function than in those with residual beta-cell function at 20, 15, and 10 yr after the onset of diabetes (p = 0.013, p = 0.006, and p = 0.048, respectively), but not at 5 yr after the onset (p = 0.84). there were higher mean glycosylated hemoglobin values during the entire follow-up period in the patients without detectable beta-cell function at 20 and 15 yr after the onset of diabetes (p = 0.030 and p = 0.042, respectively). positivity for hla-a24 and -dqa1 03, as well as the acute onset of diabetes, was associated with early beta-cell loss and also with early development of diabetic retinopathy. cox proportional hazards analysis showed that undetectable beta-cell function at 20, 15, or 10 yr after the onset of diabetes was an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic retinopathy.   conclusions undetectable beta-cell function within 10 yr of the onset of type 1 diabetes is associated with the earlier occurrence of diabetic retinopathy.
a longitudinal twin study of borderline and antisocial personality disorder traits in early to middle adulthood. a sample of 833 twins from the minnesota twin study of adult development and aging completed the multidimensional personality questionnaire (mpq; tellegen, 1982) twice, averaging 59.4 (sd=9.7) years of age at first and 64.4 (sd=10.2) years of age at second testing (average retest interval 5.0 years, sd=2.36, range 1.0-10.4 years). both means and standard deviations of scale scores were extremely stable from first to second testing. in addition, sample participants tended to retain their rank order on the scales (average r=.76 across scales). bivariate biometric analyses showed that the genetic influences on most of the scale scores were almost perfectly correlated across the two waves (range .95 to 1.00). the nonshared environmental influences were also highly correlated across the two waves (range .53 to .73). models specifying identical variance components at the two time points and fixing the genetic correlation to 1.00 provided improved fit. the results suggest that the high stability of personality in later adulthood has a strong genetic foundation, supplemented by stability of environmental effects.
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
endoscopic electrocautery incision therapy for benign lower gastrointestinal tract anastomotic strictures background and study aims endoscopic dilatation is the standard therapy for postoperative colorectal anastomotic strictures, although it carries the risk of perforation at the weakest part of the anastomosis. in order to minimize this risk we have developed a combined technique of endoscopic electroincision and hydraulic balloon dilatation.   patients and methods thirty-six symptomatic patients with benign colorectal anastomotic strictures were referred for endoscopic electroincision with consecutive balloon dilatation, if the diameter of the anastomosis was less than 12 mm (n = 15) or if the diameter was less than 20 mm and the patient complained of repeated obstructive symptoms under conservative therapy (n = 21). under direct endoscopic control the scar tissue at the anastomotic line was incised radially with the tip of the polypectomy snare or with a papillotome. endoscopic hydraulic balloon dilatation was then performed, using a pressure of 35 psi for three minutes. an endoscopic or radiological control was carried out on the second day, and balloon dilatation was repeated if necessary.   results the combined technique of electroincision and consecutive balloon dilatation was performed successfully in 35 patients. in only one patient this therapy could not be performed, because of a long stenotic segment, and surgery was necessary. in 24 patients one single dilatation was sufficient after electroincision, whereas six patients required two, and five patients required three consecutive balloon dilatations. there were no severe complications such as bleeding or perforation. complete follow-up evaluation was possible in 25 patients. in five cases recurrences appeared within the first year; all could be treated successfully by further balloon dilatation.   conclusions the combination of endoscopic electroincision and hydraulic balloon dilatation leads to a high long-term clinical success with a minimum of complications. therefore, in our opinion it is a useful method in the treatment of benign colorectal anastomotic strictures.
prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in an elderly population in nepal: the bhaktapur retina study background a national eye care programme was launched in nepal in the early 1980s. the impact of this programme on blindness and cataract surgery prevalence was evaluated in two geographic zones. methods people aged 45 years and older were sampled using a stratified cluster design. within randomly selected clusters, door to door enumeration was followed by visual acuity measurement and eye examinations at conveniently located sites. the full survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance measures carried out. results of the 5112 enumerated individuals 90% were examined. blindness, defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 in both eyes, was found in 5.3% (95% ci 3.6, 6.8) of individuals examined, with cataract being the principal cause in at least one eye in 78% of cases. considering both cataract operated and unoperated cataract blind cases, surgical coverage was approximately 42%. conclusion the findings suggest that blindness prevalence may have decreased slightly from that estimated in a 1981 national survey, both overall and cataract related. similarly, cataract surgical coverage may have increased somewhat. none of these changes, however, are at statistically significant levels. accordingly, the blindness problem remains challengingly high.
the effectiveness of hydrotherapy in the management of fibromyalgia syndrome: a systematic review objective to evaluate the effects of 6 months of pool exercise combined with a 6 session education program for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (fm).   methods the study population comprised 58 patients, randomized to a treatment or a control group. patients were instructed to match the pool exercises to their threshold of pain and fatigue. the education focused on strategies for coping with symptoms and encouragement of physical activity. the primary outcome measurements were the total score of the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (fiq) and the 6 min walk test, recorded at study start and after 6 mo. several other tests and instruments assessing functional limitations, severity of symptoms, disabilities, and quality of life were also applied.   results significant differences between the treatment group and the control group were found for the fiq total score (p = 0.017) and the 6 min walk test (p < 0.0001). significant differences were also found for physical function, grip strength, pain severity, social functioning, psychological distress, and quality of life.   conclusion the results suggest that a 6 month program of exercises in a temperate pool combined with education will improve the consequences of fm.
prognostic factors in patients with gastroenteropancreaticneuroendocrine neoplasms and hepatic metastases according to the international guidelines, a multidisciplinary approach is currently advised for the optimal care of patients with a gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (gep net). in our institution (tertiary care center), a systematic multidisciplinary approach was established in may 2007. in this study, we have aimed to assess the initial impact of establishing a systematic multidisciplinary approach to the management of gep net patients. we have collected and compared the biochemical, imaging, and pathological data and the therapeutic strategies in gep net patients diagnosed, treated, or followed-up from january 1993 to april 2007 versus gep net patients attending our institution after the multidisciplinary approach starting, from may 2007 to october 2008. data of 91 patients before and 42 patients after the establishment of the multidisciplinary approach (total: 133 consecutive gep net patients) have been finally collected and analyzed. before the establishment of the multidisciplinary approach, a lack of consistency in the biochemical, imaging, and pathological findings before treatment initiation as well as during follow-up of gep net patients was identified. these inconsistencies have been reduced by the systematic multidisciplinary approach. in addition, the therapeutic management of gep net patients has been altered by the multidisciplinary approach and became more consistent with recommended guidelines. we think that a systematic multidisciplinary approach significantly impacts on gep net patient care and should be established in all centers dealing with these tumors.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
scar quantification by cardiovascular magnetic resonance as an independent predictor of long-term survival in patients with ischemic heart failure treated by coronary artery bypass graft surgery objectives we hypothesized that myocardial scar characterization using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cmr) may be associated with the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (vt), appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd) therapy and mortality.   background since a minority of patients with prophylactic icd implantation receive appropriate icd therapy, there is a need for more effective risk stratification for primary prevention in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.   methods and results in 99 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, cmr was performed prior to icd implantation. we assessed if cmr indices (cardiac mass, lvef) and cmr scar characteristics (infarct core mass, peri-infarction mass and the ratio's between left ventricular mass, infarct core mass and peri-infarction mass) were associated with outcome. the primary endpoint was sustained vt and/or appropriate icd therapy. the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. during a median follow-up of 5.4 years (iqr 4.5-6.6 years), 34 patients reached the primary end-point (17 appropriate icd shocks) and 26 patients died. in multivariable cox regression analysis, peri-infarction to core-infarction ratio (hr 2.01, 95%ci: 1.17-3.44, p=0.01) was independently and significantly associated with the primary endpoint, whereas nyha-class and lower lvef were not. conversely, age (hr 1.06, 95% ci: 1.01-1.12, p=0.02) and lower lvef (hr 0.95, 95% ci: 0.91-1.00, p=0.04) were independently associated with all-cause mortality, mainly due to heart failure.   conclusion a relatively large peri-infarction mass is associated with sustained vt and/or appropriate icd therapy, whereas age and lower lvef are associated with mortality. cmr based tissue characterization could aid in the prediction of specific outcome measures and in clinical decision making.
mri-based attenuation correction for pet/mri using multiphase level-set method we present an approach for head mr-based attenuation correction (ac) based on the statistical parametric mapping 8 (spm8) software, which combines segmentation- and atlas-based features to provide a robust technique to generate attenuation maps (μ maps) from mr data in integrated pet/mr scanners. methods: coregistered anatomic mr and ct images of 15 glioblastoma subjects were used to generate the templates. the mr images from these subjects were first segmented into 6 tissue classes (gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, bone, soft tissue, and air), which were then nonrigidly coregistered using a diffeomorphic approach. a similar procedure was used to coregister the anatomic mr data for a new subject to the template. finally, the ct-like images obtained by applying the inverse transformations were converted to linear attenuation coefficients to be used for ac of pet data. the method was validated on 16 new subjects with brain tumors (n = 12) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 4) who underwent ct and pet/mr scans. the μ maps and corresponding reconstructed pet images were compared with those obtained using the gold standard ct-based approach and the dixon-based method available on the biograph mmr scanner. relative change (rc) images were generated in each case, and voxel- and region-of-interest–based analyses were performed. results: the leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of the data from the 15 atlas-generation subjects showed small errors in brain linear attenuation coefficients (rc, 1.38% ± 4.52%) compared with the gold standard. similar results (rc, 1.86% ± 4.06%) were obtained from the analysis of the atlas-validation datasets. the voxel- and region-of-interest–based analysis of the corresponding reconstructed pet images revealed quantification errors of 3.87% ± 5.0% and 2.74% ± 2.28%, respectively. the dixon-based method performed substantially worse (the mean rc values were 13.0% ± 10.25% and 9.38% ± 4.97%, respectively). areas closer to the skull showed the largest improvement. conclusion: we have presented an spm8-based approach for deriving the head μ map from mr data to be used for pet ac in integrated pet/mr scanners. its implementation is straightforward and requires only the morphologic data acquired with a single mr sequence. the method is accurate and robust, combining the strengths of both segmentation- and atlas-based approaches while minimizing their drawbacks.
revisiting the rise and fall of false recall: presentation rate effects depend on retention interval two experiments examined false recall for lists of semantically and phonologically associated words as a function of presentation duration. veridical recall increased with long exposure durations for all lists. for semantically associated lists, false recall increased from 20-250 ms, then decreased. there was a high level of false recall with 20 ms durations for phonologically associated lists (47 and 44% for experiments 1 and 2, respectively), which declined as duration increased. in experiment 2, for lists presented at 20 and 50 ms rates, false recall given zero correct recall was observed frequently, suggesting that conscious recollection of studied words was not necessary for phonological false memory. differences between phonologically and semantically associated lists were consistent with a feature integration model based on automatic initial processing of phonetic features of words.
soil microbial biomass and activity in tropical riparian forests the prevailing paradigm for anticipating changes in soil organic carbon (soc) with changes in land use postulates reductions in soc in managed systems (agriculture and tree plantations) relative to mature tropical forests. variations of this notion are used in carbon models to predict the role of tropical soils in the global carbon cycle. invariably these models show tropical soils as sources of atmospheric carbon. we present data from a variety of studies that show that soc in managed systems can be lower, the same as, or greater than mature tropical forests and that soc can increase rapidly after the abandonment of agricultural fields. history of land use affects the comparison of soc in managed and natural ecosystems. our review of the literature also highlights the need for greater precautions when comparing soc in mature tropical forests with that of managed ecosystems. information on previous land use, bulk density, and consistency in sampling depth are some of the most common omissions in published studies. from comparable soc data from a variety of tropical land uses we estimate that tropical soils can accumulate between 168 and 553 tg c/yr. the greatest potential for carbon sequestration in tropical soils is in the forest fallows which cover some 250 million hectares. increased attention to soc by land managers can result in greater rates of carbon sequestration than predicted by current soc models.
decreased apelin and apelin-receptor expression in the pulmonary vasculature of nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia background/purpose congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh) remains a major therapeutic challenge despite advances in neonatal resuscitation and intensive care. the high mortality and morbidity in cdh has been attributed to pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension (ph). bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (bmpr2) plays a key role in pulmonary vasculogenesis during the late stages of fetal lung development. bmpr2 is essential for control of endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation. dysfunction of bmpr2 and downstream signaling have been shown to disturb the crucial balance of proliferation of smooth muscle cells contributing to the pathogenesis of human and experimental ph. we designed this study to investigate the hypothesis that bmpr2 signaling is disrupted in nitrofen-induced cdh.   methods pregnant rats were treated with nitrofen or vehicle on gestational day 9 (d9). fetuses were sacrificed on d21 and divided into cdh and control. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and confocal-immunofluorescence were performed to determine pulmonary gene expression levels and protein expression of bmpr2 and related proteins.   results pulmonary bmpr2 gene expression levels were significantly decreased in nitrofen-induced cdh compared to controls. western blotting and confocal microscopy revealed decreased pulmonary bmpr2 protein expression and increased activation of p38(mapk) in cdh compared to controls.   conclusion the observed disruption of the bmpr2 signaling pathway may lead to extensive vascular remodeling and contribute to ph in the nitrofen-induced cdh model. bmpr2 may therefore represent a potential target for the treatment of ph in cdh.
separation of singing voice from music accompaniment for monaural recordings a new method for estimating the fundamental frequencies of concurrent musical sounds is described. the method is based on an iterative approach, where the fundamental frequency of the most prominent sound is estimated, the sound is subtracted from the mixture, and the process is repeated for the residual signal. for the estimation stage, an algorithm is proposed which utilizes the frequency relationships of simultaneous spectral components, without assuming ideal harmonicity. for the subtraction stage, the spectral smoothness principle is proposed as an efficient new mechanism in estimating the spectral envelopes of detected sounds. with these techniques, multiple fundamental frequency estimation can be performed quite accurately in a single time frame, without the use of long-term temporal features. the experimental data comprised recorded samples of 30 musical instruments from four different sources. multiple fundamental frequency estimation was performed for random sound source and pitch combinations. error rates for mixtures ranging from one to six simultaneous sounds were 1.8%, 3.9%, 6.3%, 9.9%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. in musical interval and chord identification tasks, the algorithm outperformed the average of ten trained musicians. the method works robustly in noise, and is able to handle sounds that exhibit inharmonicities. the inharmonicity factor and spectral envelope of each sound is estimated along with the fundamental frequency.
negative affectivity moderated by bdnf and stress response. there has been a dramatic rise in gene x environment studies of human behavior over the past decade that have moved the field beyond simple nature versus nurture debates. these studies offer promise in accounting for more variability in behavioral and biological phenotypes than studies that focus on genetic or experiential factors alone. they also provide clues into mechanisms of modifying genetic risk or resilience in neurodevelopmental disorders. yet, it is rare that these studies consider how these interactions change over the course of development. in this paper, we describe research that focuses on the impact of a polymorphism in a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene, known to be involved in learning and development. specifically we present findings that assess the effects of genotypic and environmental loadings on neuroanatomic and behavioral phenotypes across development. the findings illustrate the use of a genetic mouse model that mimics the human polymorphism, to constrain the interpretation of gene-environment interactions across development in humans.
a metapopulation modelling framework for gonorrhoea and other sexually transmitted infections in heterosexual populations spatial distribution of repeat and singly occurring gonorrhea in baltimore, maryland, was examined to identify clusters of core transmitters. gonorrhea reported between 2001 and 2002 was geocoded and mapped. those with more than one gonorrhea infection separated by more than 14 days during the 2-year period were considered repeaters. other cases were treated as isolated events. six definitions of core transmission were examined by census tracts with the highest quintiles of 1) cases for 2001, 2) cases for 2002, 3) rates for 2001, 4) rates for 2002, 5) counts of repeaters over the 2-year period, and 6) proportion of total cases that were repeaters. of the 6,108 gonorrhea cases analyzed, 9% were repeaters. repeaters were more likely to be female and younger. core areas identified by definitions based on overall disease burden agreed well with each other but had poor agreement with definitions based upon repeat infections. repeaters clustered to a greater extent at smaller distances than did singly occurring gonorrhea cases. repeat gonorrhea infections are prevalent in baltimore and likely represent behavior consistent with core transmission. census tracts of core transmission defined by geographic distribution of repeat infections may indicate foci of highest risk sexual behaviors and high transmission.
multiple infection sources identification with provable guarantees assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.
occurrence of genetic modifications in core, 5′utr and ns5b of hcv associated with viral response to treatment we investigated 143 patients with various classes of liver disease and 120 healthy subjects for serological markers of hepatitis c and b viruses. we found a prevalence rate of 37.1% of anti-hcv markers in patients with liver disease (cases), and 4.2% and in the control group. hbsag was detected in 33.6% of cases and 13.3% of the controls. anti-hcv and hbsag were detected in 7.7% of cases but were not detected in the controls. anti-hcv, hbsag, anti-hbe and anti-hdv were detected in three patients. serum protein electrophoresis results showed elevated gammaglobulin and low albumin in patients positive for anti-hcv who had liver disease.
parents' attitudes and behaviours towards recommended vaccinations in sicily, italy background the rate of nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements has been increasing, and children with exemptions have contributed to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.   objectives to determine why parents claim nonmedical exemptions and to explore differences in perceptions of vaccines and vaccine information sources between parents of exempt and fully vaccinated children.   design case-control study.   setting colorado, massachusetts, missouri, and washington.   participants surveys were mailed to the parents of 815 exempt children (cases) and 1630 fully vaccinated children (controls randomly selected from the same grade and school) recruited from 112 private and public elementary schools. surveys were completed by 2435 parents (56.1%).   main outcome measures parental reports.   results most children (209 [75.5%] of 277) with nonmedical exemptions received at least some vaccines. the most common vaccine not received was varicella (147 [53.1%] of 277 exempt children). the most common reason stated for requesting exemptions (190 [69%] of 277) was concern that the vaccines might cause harm. parents of exempt children were significantly more likely than parents of vaccinated children to report low perceived vaccine safety and efficacy, a low level of trust in the government, and low perceived susceptibility to and severity of vaccine-preventable diseases. parents of exempt children were significantly less likely to report confidence in medical, public health, and government sources for vaccine information and were more likely to report confidence in alternative medicine professionals than parents of vaccinated children.   conclusion continued efforts must be made to educate parents about the utility and safety of vaccines, especially parents requesting nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements.
protective effect of curcumin on oxidative stress and dna fragmentation against lambda cyhalothrin-induced liver damage in rats the aim of this study was to investigate the toxic effects of pyrethroid pesticide lambda-cyhalothrin in the presence of piperonyl butoxide as a modulator in the liver of juvenile oreochromis niloticus. lc(50) (96h) value of lambda-cyhalothrin was determined as 2.901μg/l for o. niloticus. the fish were exposed to 0.48μg/l (1/6 of the 96-h lc(50)) lambda-cyhalothrin and 10μg/l piperonyl butoxide for 96-h and 15-d. tgsh, gsh, gssg, hsp70 and tbars contents, gpx, gr, gst and caspase-3 enzymes activities were determined. lambda-cyhalothrin caused increases in tgsh, gsh, tbars contents, and gst activity. piperonyl butoxide treatment with lambda-cyhalothrin caused significant increases in tgsh gsh, hsp70, tbars contents, and gpx and gst activities while caspase-3 activity was decreased. the results of the present study revealed that lambda-cyhalothrin caused oxidative stress which upregulated gsh and gsh-related enzymes. piperonyl butoxide increased the oxidative stress potential and apoptotic effects of lambda-cyhalothrin.
managing more than the mean: using quantile regression to identify factors related to large elk groups many studies have examined grouping as a form of antipredator behaviour, but relatively few studies have examined how group size responds to natural variation in predation risk across space and through time. we studied the responses of elk, cervus elaphus, herd size and composition to natural variation in the risk of predation by wolves, canis lupus, in the gallatin canyon of montana. we found that elk herd size increased as distance to protective cover increased. a positive association between group size and distance to cover is often interpreted as evidence that grouping is an antipredator response. however, we found that herd size increased only on days that wolves were absent. when wolves were present, herd sizes remained small at all distances from cover. this suggests that aggregation far from cover on days that wolves were absent was a foraging response, rather than an antipredator response. these data highlight interaction between temporal and spatial variation in predation risk, and suggest caution in conclusions about the antipredator benefits of grouping in the absence of direct data on risk or predator presence.
annual and diurnal variations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in 31 provincial capital cities based on in situ air quality monitoring data from china national environmental monitoring center. o3 and pm2.5 were introduced into the newly revised air quality standard system in february 2012, representing a milestone in the history of air pollution control, and china's urban air quality will be evaluated using six factors (so2, no2, o3, co, pm2.5 and pm10) from the beginning of 2013. to achieve the new air quality standard, it is extremely important to have a primary understanding of the current pollution status in various cities. the spatial and temporal variations of the air pollutants were investigated in 26 pilot cities in china from august 2011 to february 2012, just before the new standard was executed. hourly averaged so2, no2 and pm10 were observed in 26 cities, and the pollutants o3, co and pm2.5 were measured in 15 of the 26 cities. the concentrations of so2 and co were much higher in the cities in north china than those in the south. as for o3 and no2, however, there was no significant difference between northern and southern cities. fine particles were found to account for a large proportion of airborne particles, with the ratio of pm2.5 to pm10 ranging from 55% to 77%. the concentrations of pm2.5 (57.5 microg/m3) and pm10 (91.2 microg/m3) were much higher than the values (pm2.5: 11.2 microg/m3; pm10: 35.6 microg/m3) recommended by the world health organization. the attainment of the new urban air quality standard in the investigated cities is decreased by 20% in comparison with the older standard without considering o3, co and pm2.5, suggesting a great challenge in urban air quality improvement, and more efforts will to be taken to control air pollution in china.
cue reactivity is associated with duration and severity of alcohol dependence: an fmri study why are some individuals more susceptible to the formation of inflexible habits than others? in the present study, we used diffusion tensor imaging to demonstrate that brain connectivity predicts individual differences in relative goal-directed and habitual behavioral control in humans. specifically, vulnerability to habitual “slips of action” toward no-longer-rewarding outcomes was predicted by estimated white matter tract strength in the premotor cortex seeded from the posterior putamen (as well as by gray matter density in the posterior putamen as determined with voxel-based morphometry). in contrast, flexible goal-directed action was predicted by estimated tract strength in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seeded from the caudate. these findings suggest that integrity of dissociable corticostriatal pathways underlies individual differences in action control in the healthy population, which may ultimately mediate vulnerability to impulse control disorders.
efficiency of individual dosage of digoxin with calculated concentration zusammenfassungdie verschiedenen herzglykoside unterscheiden sich erheblich in ihrem retentionsverhalten bei niereninsuffizienz. bei den glykosiden digoxin, digitoxin und strophanthin besteht eine direkte beziehung zwischen dem ausmaß der retention und der normalen renalen clearance dieser substanzen: strophanthin hat die höchste renale clearance und bei niereninsuffizienz die deutlichste verlängerung der pharmakologischen wirkung, während digitoxin eine sehr niedrige clearance hat und auch bei anurischen patienten wegen der erhöhten hepatischen clearance nicht verlangsamt ausgeschieden wird; digoxin nimmt eine mittelstellung ein.die renale ausscheidung eines herzglykosides und seiner metaboliten hängt nicht nur von der clearance, sondern auch von der plasmakonzentration ab, und diese steigt während der ersten tage unter regelmäßiger einnahme bemerkenswert an. von der täglichen dosis werden durch normale nieren unter “steady-state”-bedingungen etwa 90% des strophanthins, 70% des digoxins und 50% des digitoxins (unverändertes herzglykosid und metaboliten) ausgeschieden.die effektivität der hämodialyse hinsichtlich der elimination von herzglykosiden ist gering (3–5%), wenn man sie — wie bisher üblich — mit der menge des einmalig vor beginn der dialyse injizierten herzglykosids vergleicht, sie ist aber relativ hoch (30–50%) im vergleich zur ausscheidungskapazität normaler nieren während einer zeitspanne, die der dialysedauer entspricht. während der hämodialyse sinkt die plasmakonzentration von digoxin so schnell wie bei patienten mit normaler nierenfunktion. dies wird nicht nur durch die effektivität der hämodialyse, sondern auch durch das bei niereninsuffizienz verkleinerte verteilungsvolumen des herzglykosides hervorgerufen.abnahme des verteilungsvolumens und reduzierte myokardempfindlichkeit für herzglykoside bei patienten mit niereninsuffizienz sind die hauptgründe für eine schlechte vorhersagbarkeit der notwendigen individuellen erhaltungsdosis anhand der kreatininclearance. bei patienten mit niereninsuffizienz ist die digitalistoleranz zwar herabgesetzt in hinblick auf die notwendige erhaltungsdosis, aber eher erhöht in hinblick auf die notwendige plasmakonzentration zur aufrechterhaltung der positiv inotropen wirkung. die kombination von hyperkaliämie, hypermagnesiämie, hypokalciämie und acidose, die praktisch nur bei chronischer niereninsuffizienz beobachtet wird, kann die herabgesetzte myokardempfindlichkeit erklären.wenn eine „effektive digitalisierung“ angestrebt wird, können dosierungsformeln, die sich an der kreatininclearance orientieren, nur wenig helfen. wiederholte messungen der “steady-state” plasmakonzentration eines herzglykosides scheinen der einzige weg zur reduzierung des risikos einer unter- bzw. überdigitalisierung bei patienten mit gestörter nierenfunktion zu sein.summarythe various cardiac glycosides differ significantly in their retention as a result of renal failure. in the case of digoxin, digitoxin, and strophanthin the retention is directly related to the normal renal clearance of these cardiac glycosides: strophanthin has the highest clearance and the most marked prolongation of pharmacological action in renal failure, whereas digitoxin shows the lowest renal clearance and even in uremic patients a total elimination comparable to normal subjects as a result of increased hepatic clearance; digoxin takes an intermediate position.the quantity of a cardiac glycoside and its metabolites excreted by the kidneys depends, besides the renal clearance, on the plasma concentration which increases considerably during the first days after onset of treatment. from the daily dose approximately 90% of strophanthin, 70% of digoxin, 50% of digitoxin plus metabolites are excreted by normal kidneys under steady-state conditions.the efficiency of hemodialysis in the elimination of cardiac glycosides is low (3–5%) if estimated in relation to a single dose injected before dialysis and high (30–50%) if estimated in relation to the excretory capacity of normal kidneys during a period corresponding to the duration of a dialysis. during hemodialysis the plasma concentration of digoxin decreases as rapidly as in patients with normal renal function. beside the efficiency of dialysis this finding may be explained by the decrease in the apparent volume of distribution of cardiac glycosides in patients with advanced renal failure; a reduced tissue protein binding seems likely to be the main reason for these changes in chronic renal insufficiency.a reduced volume of distribution and a reduced myocardial sensitivity are the main reasons for a very low predictability of the necessary individual maintenance dose of cardiac glycosides from the creatinine clearance. in patients with advanced renal insufficiency the tolerance to cardiac glycosides is reduced with respect to the daily dose, but it is rather increased in relation to the plasma concentration required to maintain the positive inotropic effect. the combination of hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia and acidosis which is found almost exclusively with chronic renal failure, may explain the reduced myocardial sensitivity. dosage regimens based on the measurement of creatinine-clearance are of little help in “effective digitalisation”. serial measurements of steady-state plasma concentration of cardiac glycosides may be the only way to reduce the risk of under-and overtreatment in patients with impaired renal function.
heightened fear in response to a safety cue and extinguished fear cue in a rat model of maternal immune activation maternal exposure to infection during pregnancy greatly increases the risk of psychopathology in the offspring. in support of clinical findings, rodent models of maternal immune activation (mia) show that prenatal exposure to pathogens can induce phenotypic changes in the offspring associated with schizophrenia, autism, depression and anxiety. in the current study, we investigated the effects of mia via polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly i:c) on emotional behavior and communication in rats. pregnant rats were administered poly i:c or saline on gestation day 15 and male offspring were tested in an auditory fear conditioning paradigm in early adulthood. we found that prenatal poly i:c exposure significantly altered affective signaling, namely, the production of aversive 22-khz ultrasonic vocalizations (usvs), in terms of call number, structure and temporal patterning. mia led to an increase in aversive 22-khz usvs to 300% of saline controls. offspring exposed to mia not only emitted more 22-khz usvs, but also emitted calls that were shorter in duration and occurred in bouts containing more calls. the production of appetitive 50-khz usvs and audible calls was not affected. intriguingly, alterations in aversive 22-khz usv emission were observed despite no obvious changes in overt defensive behavior, which highlights the importance of assessing usvs as an additional measure of fear. aversive 22-khz usvs are a prominent part of the rat's defensive behavioral repertoire and serve important communicative functions, most notably as alarm calls. the observed changes in aversive 22-khz usvs show that mia has long-term effects on emotional behavior and communication in exposed rat offspring.
er-α36, a novel variant of erα, is involved in the regulation of tamoxifen-sensitivity of glioblastoma cells cyclin b1 is the regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) and is critical for the initiation of mitosis. accumulating data indicate that the deregulation of cyclin b1 is tightly linked to neoplastic transformation. to study the phenotype and the potential preclinical relevance, we generated hela cell lines stably transfected with the plasmids encompassing short hairpin rna (shrna) targeting cyclin b1. we demonstrate that the reduction of cyclin b1 caused inhibition of proliferation by arresting cells in g2 phase and by inducing apoptosis. cells, entering mitosis, were impaired in chromosome condensation and alignment. importantly, hela cells with reduced cyclin b1 were more susceptible to the treatment of small interfering rna targeting polo-like kinase 1 (plk1) and to the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent taxol. finally, hela cells with reduced cyclin b1 showed inhibited tumor growth in nude mice compared to that of control cells. in summary, our data indicate that cyclin b1 is an essential molecule for tumor cell survival and aggressive proliferation, suggesting that the downregulation of cyclin b1, especially in combination with other molecular targets, might become an interesting strategy for antitumor intervention.
traffic-related air pollution and dementia incidence in northern sweden: a longitudinal study background traffic-related particles induce oxidative stress and may exert adverse effects on central nervous system function, which could manifest as cognitive impairment. objective we assessed the association between black carbon (bc), a marker of traffic-related air pollution, and cognition in older men. methods a total of 680 men (mean ± sd, 71 ± 7 years of age) from the u.s. department of veterans affairs normative aging study completed a battery of seven cognitive tests at least once between 1996 and 2007. we assessed long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution using a validated spatiotemporal land-use regression model for bc. results the association between bc and cognition was nonlinear, and we log-transformed bc estimates for all analyses [ln(bc)]. in a multivariable-adjusted model, for each doubling in bc on the natural scale, the odds of having a mini-mental state examination (mmse) score ≤ 25 was 1.3 times higher [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.1 to 1.6]. in a multivariable-adjusted model for global cognitive function, which combined scores from the remaining six tests, a doubling of bc was associated with a 0.054 sd lower test score (95% ci, −0.103 to −0.006), an effect size similar to that observed with a difference in age of 1.9 years in our data. we found no evidence of heterogeneity by cognitive test. in sensitivity analyses adjusting for past lead exposure, the association with mmse scores was similar (odds ratio = 1.3; 95% ci, 1.1 to 1.7), but the association with global cognition was somewhat attenuated (−0.038 per doubling in bc; 95% ci, −0.089 to 0.012). conclusions ambient traffic-related air pollution was associated with decreased cognitive function in older men.
cooperative processing in primary somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex during tactile working memory background both monkey neurophysiological and human eeg studies have shown that association cortices, as well as primary sensory cortical areas, play an essential role in sequential neural processes underlying cross-modal working memory.   objective the present study aims to further examine causal and sequential roles of the primary sensory cortex and association cortex in cross-modal working memory.   methods individual mri-based single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (sptms) was applied to bilateral primary somatosensory cortices (si) and the contralateral posterior parietal cortex (ppc), while participants were performing a tactile-visual cross-modal delayed matching-to-sample task. time points of sptms were 300 ms, 600 ms, 900 ms after the onset of the tactile sample stimulus in the task.   results the accuracy of task performance and reaction time were significantly impaired when sptms was applied to the contralateral si at 300 ms. significant impairment on performance accuracy was also observed when the contralateral ppc was stimulated at 600 ms.   conclusion si and ppc play sequential and distinct roles in neural processes of cross-modal associations and working memory.
mir-185/akt and mir-29a/collagen 1a pathways are activated in ipf bal cells idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a chronic, progressive, and highly lethal fibrotic lung disease with poor treatment and unknown etiology. emerging evidence suggests that epithelial–mesenchymal transition (emt) has an important role in repair and scar formation following epithelial injury during pulmonary fibrosis. although some mirnas have been shown to be dysregulated in the pathophysiological processes of ipf, limited studies have payed attention on the participation of mirnas in emt in lung fibrosis. in our study, we identified and constructed a regulation network of differentially expressed ipf mirnas and emt genes. additionally, we found the downregulation of mir-26a in mice with experimental pulmonary fibrosis. further studies showed that mir-26a regulated hmga2, which is a key factor in the process of emt and had the maximum number of regulating mirnas in the regulation network. more importantly, inhibition of mir-26a resulted in lung epithelial cells transforming into myofibroblasts in vitro and in vivo, whereas forced expression of mir-26a alleviated tgf-β1- and blm-induced emt in a549 cells and in mice, respectively. taken together, our study deciphered the essential role of mir-26a in the pathogenesis of emt in pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that mir-26a may be a potential therapeutic target for ipf.
nuclear progesterone receptor ( pr ) a and b isoforms in mouse fallopian tube and uterus : implications for expression , regulation and cellular function abbreviated title : nuclear pr isoforms in mouse fallopian tube and uterus two anti-progesterone receptor (pgr) antibodies, a new one specific to pgrb, the other to pgr subtypes a + b, have been used to examine the cellular location of pgr subtypes a and b in normal endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle and in early human decidua by standard immunohistochemical techniques. pgr(a+b) is the receptor detected by the antibody recognizing both isoforms of the receptor. pgrb is the receptor detected by the new antibody specific to the b isoform. since it is not possible to raise antibody specific to pgr subtype a, all immunohistochemical analysis of the pgra subtype is by subtractive inference. thus we refer to pgra as the subtype responsible for positive immunoreactivity when the pgrb subtype cannot be specifically detected. endometrial biopsies were collected from 40 women with regular menses (n = 5 each stage of cycle: menstrual; early, mid and late proliferative; ovulatory; early, mid, and late secretory). decidual tissue was obtained from 10 women undergoing first trimester surgical termination of pregnancy. as previously reported, the pgr(a+b) antibody stained glandular and stromal nuclei during the proliferative phase but only stromal nuclei during the secretory phase and early pregnancy. the new pgrb antibody also stained both cell types intensely during the proliferative phase, but failed to stain either stromal or glandular nuclei strongly during the secretory phase and early pregnancy. we concluded that, while both pgr subtypes were present in glands and stroma in the proliferative phase, and both subtypes were dramatically reduced in the glands during the secretory phase, pgra remained as the predominant type in the stroma during the secretory phase and early pregnancy. the profound effects of progesterone on endometrium during the secretory phase and early pregnancy appear to be mediated primarily by pgra in the stroma.
increased prevalence of gallstone disease and impaired gallbladder motility in patients with barrett’s esophagus objectives:gallstones and hiatal hernia reportedly have been linked to similar dietary factors prevalent in western countries, and patients with cholelithiasis or previous cholecystectomy have been reported to have more duodenogastric reflux than healthy controls. nonetheless, the contribution of duodenogastric reflux to the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) remains controversial. the present study was aimed to assess the association between gallstone disease and gerd.methods:outpatients from general medical clinics who underwent upper gi endoscopy and abdominal ultrasonography were recruited into a case-control study. a case population of 790 patients with various grades of gerd was compared to a control population of 407 patients without gerd. in a multivariate logistic regression, the presence of gerd served as the outcome variable, whereas the presence of gallstones, hiatal hernia, social habits, and demographic characteristics served as predictor variables.results:no associations were found between the presence of cholelithiasis or previous cholecystectomy and gerd or between the presence of cholelithiasis or previous cholecystectomy and hiatal hernia. the severity of gerd also remained unaffected by the presence of gallstones. the occurrence of gerd was influenced only by hiatal hernia (odds ratio [or] = 3.15, 95% ci = 2.44–4.08), alcohol consumption (or = 1.47, ci = 1.08–1.99), and not by cholelithiasis (or = 1.02, ci = 0.68–1.51), or cholecystectomy (or = 0.90, ci = 0.64–1.28). the frequency of gerd among hiatus hernia patients with gallstones (437/592 = 74%) was similar to the frequency of gerd among hiatus hernia patients without gallstones (168/220 = 76%, p = 0.516).conclusions:neither cholelithiasis nor cholecystectomy poses a risk for the occurrence of gerd or hiatal hernia. gallstone disease does not seem to influence the integrity of the esophageal mucosa through gerd.
efficient algorithms for general active learning we state and analyze the first active learning algorithm which works in the presence of arbitrary forms of noise. the algorithm, a2 (for agnostic active), relies only upon the assumption that the samples are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution. we show that a2 achieves an exponential improvement (i.e., requires only o (ln 1/ε) samples to find an ε-optimal classifier) over the usual sample complexity of supervised learning, for several settings considered before in the realizable case. these include learning threshold classifiers and learning homogeneous linear separators with respect to an input distribution which is uniform over the unit sphere.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
proteomic analysis of glycine receptor β subunit (glyrβ)-interacting proteins synaptic transmission relies on effective and accurate compensatory endocytosis. f‐bar proteins may serve as membrane curvature sensors and/or inducers and thereby support membrane remodelling processes; yet, their in vivo functions urgently await disclosure. we demonstrate that the f‐bar protein syndapin i is crucial for proper brain function. syndapin i knockout (ko) mice suffer from seizures, a phenotype consistent with excessive hippocampal network activity. loss of syndapin i causes defects in presynaptic membrane trafficking processes, which are especially evident under high‐capacity retrieval conditions, accumulation of endocytic intermediates, loss of synaptic vesicle (sv) size control, impaired activity‐dependent sv retrieval and defective synaptic activity. detailed molecular analyses demonstrate that syndapin i plays an important role in the recruitment of all dynamin isoforms, central players in vesicle fission reactions, to the membrane. consistently, syndapin i ko mice share phenotypes with dynamin i ko mice, whereas their seizure phenotype is very reminiscent of fitful mice expressing a mutant dynamin. thus, syndapin i acts as pivotal membrane anchoring factor for dynamins during regeneration of svs.
regional population structure of a widely introduced estuarine invertebrate: nematostella vectensis stephenson in new england molecular markers derived from polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of genomic dna are an important part of the toolkit of evolutionary geneticists. random amplified polymorphic dna markers (rapds), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (aflps) and intersimple sequence repeat (issr) polymorphisms allow analysis of species for which previous dna sequence information is lacking, but dominance makes it impossible to apply standard techniques to calculate f‐statistics. we describe a bayesian method that allows direct estimates of fst from dominant markers. in contrast to existing alternatives, we do not assume previous knowledge of the degree of within‐population inbreeding. in particular, we do not assume that genotypes within populations are in hardy–weinberg proportions. our estimate of fst incorporates uncertainty about the magnitude of within‐population inbreeding. simulations show that samples from even a relatively small number of loci and populations produce reliable estimates of fst. moreover, some information about the degree of within‐population inbreeding (fis) is available from data sets with a large number of loci and populations. we illustrate the method with a reanalysis of rapd data from 14 populations of a north american orchid, platanthera leucophaea.
optical technologies and molecular imaging for cervical neoplasia: a program project update. objective this review evaluates the diagnostic efficacy of fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, and their combination that use both point probe and multispectral imaging approaches in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo.   methods articles were selected for this review from a literature search which report the performance of fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy devices in diagnosing cervical neoplasia in vivo. this analysis focused on the comparison of point probe versus multispectral approaches; the use of fluorescence, reflectance, and their combination; and finally the types of populations that have been studied for in vivo diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (sil).   results twenty-six studies were included and their heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analysis. though point probes were expected to have greater specificity and multispectral approaches greater sensitivity, there was considerable overlap in the performance of point probe and multispectral devices. there were few studies that studied fluorescence spectroscopy alone and reflectance spectroscopy alone. combined fluorescence and reflectance approaches showed considerable overlap among point probe and multispectral devices. the overlap of performance suggests that fluorescence and reflectance may have similar performance. currently the paucity of data precludes definitive conclusions regarding the additive effect of both approaches. only two of twenty-six trials have recruited patients with no history of an abnormal papanicolaou smear (screening populations) and twenty-four trials include patients with a range of cervical abnormalities from atypia to cancer (diagnostic populations).   discussion optical spectroscopy using a point probe and multispectral approaches appears to overlap in performance. fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopies examine different aspects of epithelial-stromal biology and appear to yield similar diagnostic performance. while intuitively appealing, their combination may or may not be additive. there have been few studies of these technologies in screening populations. better definitions of device trial design and reporting requirements would facilitate combining analyses to formally examine performance.
aurora b kinase inhibitor azd1152: determinants of action and ability to enhance chemotherapeutics effectiveness in pancreatic and colon cancer aurora kinases play a critical role in regulating mitosis and cell division, and their overexpression has been implicated in the survival and proliferation of human cancer. in this study, we report the in vitro and in vivo activities of azd1152, a compound that has selectivity for aurora b kinase, in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) cell lines, primary aml samples, and cord blood cells. azd1152 exerted antiproliferative or cytotoxic effects in all cell lines studied, inhibited the phosphorylation of histone h3 (phis h3) on ser10 in a dose-dependent manner, and resulted in cells with >4n dna content. thp-1 cells treated with azd1152 accumulated in a state of polyploidy and showed a senescent response to the drug, in contrast to the apoptotic response seen in other cell lines. accordingly, azd1152 profoundly affected the growth of aml cell lines and primary aml in an in vivo xenotransplantation model. however, concentration-dependent effects on cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were also observed when human cord blood and primary lineage-negative stem and progenitor cells were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. these data suggest that the inhibition of aurora b kinase may be a useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of aml and that further exploration of dosing and treatment schedules is warranted in clinical trials.
sildenafil restores endothelial function in the apolipoprotein e knockout mouse hypercholesterolemia is associated with impaired neovascularization in response to ischemia. potential mechanisms include defective no bioactivity and a reduction in the number/function of endothelial progenitor cells (epcs). here we tested the hypothesis that sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor that increases no-driven cgmp levels, could stimulate epc function and improve ischemia-induced neovascularization in hypercholesterolemic conditions. apolipoprotein e–deficient (apoe−/−) mice were treated (or not treated) with sildenafil (40 mg/kg per day in water), and hindlimb ischemia was surgically induced by femoral artery removal. sildenafil treatment led to an improved blood flow recovery, an increased capillary density, and a reduction of oxidative stress levels in ischemic muscles at day 7 after surgery. sildenafil therapy is associated with an increased activation of angiogenic transduction pathways, including akt, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p38. in vitro, sildenafil increases cellular migration and tubule formation of mature endothelial cells (human umbilical vascular endothelial cells) in a cgmp-dependent manner. in vivo, apoe−/− mice treated with sildenafil exhibit a significant increase in the number of bone marrow–derived epcs. moreover, the angiogenic activities of epcs (migration and adhesion) are significantly improved in apoe−/− mice treated with sildenafil. in summary, this study demonstrates that sildenafil treatment is associated with improved ischemia-induced neovascularization in hypercholesterolemic apoe−/− mice. the mechanisms involve beneficial effects on angiogenic transduction pathways together with an increase in the number and the functional activity of epcs. sildenafil could constitute a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce tissue ischemia in atherosclerotic diseases.
proteomics of stored red blood cell membrane and storage-induced microvesicles reveals the association of flotillin-2 with band 3 complexes the redistribution of surface membrane immunoglobulin (smig) and concanavalin a (con-a) was studied in peripheral mononuclear cells of three patients who had hairy cell leukemia. fluorescein-labeled polyvalent goat antihuman immunoglobulin and fluoresceinated con-a were used as ligands. the capping of ligand-receptor complexes was temperature-dependent and was more prominent at 37 c. a significant drop in the percentages of smig and con-a capping was observed when cytochalasin b was added. in contrast, no decline in the percentages of smig and con-a capping was seen in the presence of colchicine. the inhibitory action of cytochalasin b on the capping of smig and con-a receptors in hairy cells suggests that these receptors are integral macromolecules of the plasma membrane and their redistribution is regulated by cytoskeletal structures.
regularized patch motion estimation this paper presents a new model for estimating optical flow based on the motion of planar regions plus local deformations. the approach exploits brightness information to organize and constrain the interpretation of the motion by using segmented regions of piecewise smooth brightness to hypothesize planar regions in the scene. parametric flow models are estimated in these regions in a two step process which first computes a coarse fit and then estimates the appropriate parametrization of the motion of the region. the initial fit is refined using a generalization of the standard area-based regression approaches. since the assumption of planarity is likely to be violated, we allow local deformations from the planar assumption in the same spirit as physically-based approaches which model shape using coarse parametric models plus local deformations. this parametric plus deformation model exploits the strong constraints of parametric approaches while retaining the adaptive nature of regularization approaches. experimental results on a variety of images model produces accurate flow estimates while the incorporation of brightness segmentation boundaries.
does co-morbidity provide significant improvement on age adjustment when predicting medical outcomes? objective to assess the associations of smoking, body weight, and physical activity with risk of undergoing total joint replacement (tjr) in a population-based cohort of men.   methods a cohort study of 11,388 men that integrated clinical data with hospital morbidity data and mortality records was undertaken. the risk of undergoing tjr was modeled on baseline weight, height, comorbidity, socioeconomic status, years of smoking, and exercise in 3 separate age groups, using cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk regressions (crrs).   results dose-response relationships between weight and risk of tjr and between smoking and risk of tjr were observed. being overweight independently increased the risk of tjr, while smoking lowered the risk. the decreased risk among smokers was demonstrated in both cox and crr models and became apparent after 23 years of exposure. men who were in the highest quartile (≥48 years of smoking) were 42-51% less likely to undergo tjr than men who had never smoked. tests for trend in the log hazard ratios (hrs) across both smoking and weight quantiles yielded significant p values. vigorous exercise increased the hazard of tjr; however, the association reached statistical significance only in the 70-74-year-old age group (adjusted hr 1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.19-2.24]). adjusting for deyo-charlson index or elixhauser's comorbidity measures did not eliminate these associations.   conclusion our findings indicate that being overweight and reporting vigorous physical activity increase the risk of tjr. this study is the first to demonstrate a strong inverse dose-response relationship between duration of smoking and risk of tjr. more research is needed to better understand the role of smoking in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.
bidirectional gene flow on a mangrove river landscape and between-catchment dispersal of rhizophora racemosa (rhizophoraceae) backgroundmangroves are ecologically important and highly threatened forest communities. observational and genetic evidence has confirmed the long distance dispersal capacity of water-dispersed mangrove seeds, but less is known about the relative importance of pollen vs. seed gene flow in connecting populations. we analyzed 980 avicennia germinans for 11 microsatellite loci and 940 rhizophora mangle for six microsatellite loci and subsampled two non-coding cpdna regions in order to understand population structure, and gene flow within and among four major estuaries on the caribbean and pacific coasts of panama.resultsboth species showed similar rates of outcrossing (t= 0.7 in a. germinans and 0.8 in r. mangle) and strong patterns of spatial genetic structure within estuaries, although a. germinans had greater genetic structure in nuclear and cpdna markers (7 demes > 4 demes and sp= 0.02 > 0.002), and much greater cpdna diversity (hd= 0.8 > 0.2) than r. mangle. the central american isthmus serves as an exceptionally strong barrier to gene flow, with high levels nuclear (fst= 0.3-0.5) and plastid (fst= 0.5-0.8) genetic differentiation observed within each species between coasts and no shared cpdna haplotypes between species on each coast. finally, evidence of low ratios of pollen to seed dispersal (r = −0.6 in a. germinans and 7.7 in r. mangle), coupled with the strong observed structure in nuclear and plastid dna among most estuaries, suggests low levels of gene flow in these mangrove species.conclusionswe conclude that gene dispersal in mangroves is usually limited within estuaries and that coastal geomorphology and rare long distance dispersal events could also influence levels of structure.
dietary choice for a balanced nutrient intake increases the mean and reduces the variance in the reproductive performance of male and female cockroaches summary metabolic rate varies significantly between individuals, and these differences persist even when the wide range of biotic and abiotic factors that influence metabolism are accounted for. it is important to understand the life history implications of variation in metabolic rate, but they remain poorly characterised despite a growing body of work examining relationships between metabolism and a range of traits. in the present study we used laboratory-bred families (one sire to three dams) of nauphoeta cinerea (olivier) (speckled cockroaches) to examine the relationship between standard metabolic rate (smr) and reproductive performance (number of offspring and gestation duration). we show that smr is negatively associated with female gestation duration. age at mating is negatively associated with gestation duration for females, and mass is negatively associated with the average gestation duration of the females a male was mated with. in addition to the results in the current literature, the results from the present study suggest that the association between metabolism and life history is more complex than simple relationships between metabolism and various fitness traits. future work should consider longitudinal, ontogenetic as well as selective and quantitative genetic breeding approaches to fully examine the associations between metabolism and fitness.
power efficiency of outer hair cell somatic electromotility 1. the microchamber method was used to examine the motile responses of isolated guinea pig outer hair cells to electrical stimulation. in the microchamber method, an isolated cell is drawn partway into a suction pipette and stimulated transcellularly. the relative position of the cell in the microchamber is referred to as the exclusion fraction. 2. the length changes of the included and excluded segments were compared for constant sinusoidal stimulus amplitude as functions of the exclusion fraction. both included and excluded segments showed maximal responses when the cell was excluded approximately halfway. both segments showed smaller or absent responses when the cell was almost fully excluded or almost fully included. 3. when the cell was near to, but not at, the maximum exclusion, the included segment response amplitude was zero, whereas the excluded segment response amplitude was nonzero. in contrast, when the cell was nearly fully included, the excluded segment response amplitude was zero, but the included segment response amplitude was still detectable. a simple model of outer hair cell motility based on these results suggests that the cell has finite-resistance terminations and that the motors are restricted to a region above the nucleus and below its ciliated apex (cuticular plate). 4. the function describing length change as a function of command voltage was measured for each segment as the exclusion fraction was varied. the functions were similar at midrange exclusions (i.e., when the segments were about equal length), showing nonlinearity and saturability. the functions were strikingly different when the segment lengths were different. the effects of exclusion on the voltage to length-change functions suggested that the nonlinearity and saturability are local properties of the motility mechanism. 5. the diameter changes of both segments were examined. the segment diameter changes were always antiphasic to the length changes. this finding implies that the motility mechanism has an active antiphasic diameter component. the diameter change amplitude was a monotonically increasing function of exclusion for the included segment, and a decreasing function for the excluded segment. 6. the voltage to length-change and voltage to diameter-change functions were measured for the same cell and exclusion fraction. the voltage to diameter-change function was smaller in amplitude than the voltage to length-change function. the functions were of opposite polarity to each other, but were otherwise similar in character. thus it is likely that the same motor mechanism is responsible for both axial and diameter deformations.
htt-lowering reverses huntington's disease immune dysfunction caused by nfκb pathway dysregulation. nature genetics advance online publication we undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (gwas) of alzheimer’s disease (ad) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful ad gwas to date. in stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein e (apoe) locus (most significant snp, rs2075650, p = 1.8 × 10−157) and observed genome-wide significant association with snps at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the clu (also known as apoj) gene (rs11136000, p = 1.4 × 10−9) and 5 to the picalm gene (rs3851179, p = 1.9 × 10−8). these associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with alzheimer’s disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, p = 8.5 × 10−10, odds ratio = 0.86; rs3851179, p = 1.3 × 10−9, odds ratio = 0.86).
effective targeting of prostate cancer by lymphocytes redirected by a psma × cd3 bispecific single‐chain diabody to target nk cells against non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, we constructed a bispecific diabody (bsdb) with reactivity against both human cd19 and fcγriii (cd16). bacterially produced cd19 × cd16 bsdb specifically interacted with both cd19+ and cd16+ cells and exhibited significantly higher apparent affinity and slower dissociation from the tumor cells than from effector cells. it was able to induce specific lysis of tumor cells in the presence of isolated human nk cells or nonfractionated pbls. the combination of the cd19 × cd16 bsdb with a previously described cd19 × cd3 bsdb and cd28 costimulation significantly increased the lytic potential of human pbls. treatment of scid mice bearing an established burkitt’s lymphoma (5 mm in diameter) with human pbls, cd19 × cd16 bsdb, cd19 × cd3 bsdb, and anti-cd28 mab resulted in the complete elimination of tumors in 80% of animals. in contrast, mice receiving human pbls in combination with either diabody alone showed only partial tumor regression. these data clearly demonstrate the synergistic effect of small recombinant bispecific molecules recruiting different populations of human effector cells to the same tumor target.
comparison of the oestrogen and progesterone receptor status in primary breast carcinomas as evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry: a consecutive series of 267 patients this study was undertaken to assess the potential value of thinprep-processed (cytyc, boxborough, ma) smears from malignant breast fine-needle aspirates (fnas) for the determination of estrogen receptor (er) and progesterone receptor (pr) status. the er and pr content of 142 malignant fnas were compared with the results of the surgically excised tumors in which the assay was done by enzyme immunoassay in 97 cases or by immunohistochemistry in 45 cases. monoclonal antibodies directed against er-1d5 (dako, carpinteria, ca) and pr-1a6 (dako) were used with the antigen retrieval technique. by using enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemistry as standards, the overall accuracy for er was 97% and for pr was 89%. the results of this study show that the thinprep smear with microwave antigen retrieval pretreatment is a reliable method and a suitable alternative for hormone receptor analysis in breast carcinoma.
comparison of the effects of calmidazolium, morphine and bupivacaine on n-methyl-d-aspartate- and septide-induced nociceptive behaviour intrathecal injection of substance p produced a behavioural syndrome, consisting of reciproacal hindlimb scratching and biting or fore- and hind-licking. pretreatment with either an analogue of substance p, (d-pro2, d-trp7,9)-substance p (dpdt-sp) or (d-arg1, d-pro2,4, d-trp7,9, leu11)-substance p, given intrathecally, reduced the response to substance p in a dose-dependent manner. the behaviour induced by substance p was also inhibited by intrathecal, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of morphine. intrathecal or subcutaneous injection of naloxone showed a biphasic effect on substance p response; the substance p-induced nociceptive response was increased by a small dose of naloxone, while it was inversely decreased by a large dose of naloxone. the results with analogues of substance p support the hypothesis that substance p, injected intrathecally, acts directly on substance p receptors in the spinal cord. the nociceptive response induced by substance p appears to be controlled by endogenous opioids in the spinal cord.
development and characterization of microsatellite markers for the cape gooseberry physalis peruviana a computer‐based analysis was conducted to assess the characteristics of microsatellites in transcribed regions of rice and arabidopsis. in addition, two mammals were simultaneously analyzed for a comparative analysis. our analyses confirmed a novel plant‐specific feature in which there is a gradient in microsatellite density along the direction of transcription. it was also confirmed that pyrimidine‐rich microsatellites are found intensively near the transcription start sites, specifically in the two plants, but not in the mammals. our results suggest that microsatellites located at high frequency in the 5′‐flanking regions of plant genes can potentially act as factors in regulating gene expression.
differences in emotional stimuli processing in subjects with mtle with and without depression background excessive chronic drinking is accompanied by a broad spectrum of emotional changes ranging from apathy and emotional flatness to deficits in comprehending emotional information, but their neural bases are poorly understood.   methods emotional abnormalities associated with alcoholism were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging in abstinent long-term alcoholic men in comparison to healthy demographically matched controls. participants were presented with emotionally valenced words and photographs of faces during deep (semantic) and shallow (perceptual) encoding tasks followed by recognition.   results overall, faces evoked stronger activation than words, with the expected material-specific laterality (left hemisphere for words, and right for faces) and depth of processing effects. however, whereas control participants showed stronger activation in the amygdala and hippocampus when viewing faces with emotional (relative to neutral) expressions, the alcoholics responded in an undifferentiated manner to all facial expressions. in the alcoholic participants, amygdala activity was inversely correlated with an increase in lateral prefrontal activity as a function of their behavioral deficits. prefrontal modulation of emotional function as a compensation for the blunted amygdala activity during a socially relevant face appraisal task is in agreement with a distributed network engagement during emotional face processing.   conclusions deficient activation of amygdala and hippocampus may underlie impaired processing of emotional faces associated with long-term alcoholism and may be a part of the wide array of behavioral problems including disinhibition, concurring with previously documented interpersonal difficulties in this population. furthermore, the results suggest that alcoholics may rely on prefrontal rather than temporal limbic areas in order to compensate for reduced limbic responsivity and to maintain behavioral adequacy when faced with emotionally or socially challenging situations.
taxonomic resolutions based on 18s rrna genes: a case study of subclass copepoda molecular tools have revolutionized the exploration of biodiversity, especially in organisms for which traditional taxonomy is difficult, such as for microscopic animals (meiofauna). environmental (edna) metabarcode surveys of dna extracted from sediment samples are increasingly popular for surveying biodiversity. most edna surveys use the nuclear gene-encoding small-subunit rdna gene (18s) as a marker; however, different markers and metrics used for delimiting species have not yet been evaluated against each other or against morphologically defined species (morphospecies). we assessed more than 12,000 meiofaunal sequences of 18s and of the main alternatively used marker [cytochrome c oxidase subunit i (coi) mtdna] belonging to 55 datasets covering three taxonomic ranks. our results show that 18s reduced diversity estimates by a factor of 0.4 relative to morphospecies, whereas coi increased diversity estimates by a factor of 7.6. moreover, estimates of species richness using coi were robust among three of four commonly used delimitation metrics, whereas estimates using 18s varied widely with the different metrics. we show that meiofaunal diversity has been greatly underestimated by 18s edna surveys and that the use of coi provides a better estimate of diversity. the suitability of coi is supported by cross-mating experiments in the literature and evolutionary analyses of discreteness in patterns of genetic variation. furthermore its splitting of morphospecies is expected from documented levels of cryptic taxa in exemplar meiofauna. we recommend against using 18s as a marker for biodiversity surveys and suggest that use of coi for edna surveys could provide more accurate estimates of species richness in the future.
influence of exercise on na- and hsp72-induced release of ifnγ by the peritoneal suspension of macrophages and lymphocytes from genetically obese zucker rats backgroundmetabolic syndrome (ms) is a metabolic disorder associated with obesity, type-ii diabetes, and "low grade inflammation", with the concomitant increased risk of cardiovascular events. removal of the inflammatory mediator signals is a promising strategy to protect against insulin resistance, obesity, and other problems associated with ms such as cardiovascular disease. the aim of the present investigation was to determine the "inflammatory and stress status" in an experimental model of ms, and to evaluate the effect of a program of habitual exercise and the resulting training-induced adaptation to the effects of a single bout of acute exercise.methodsobese zucker rats (fa/fa) were used as the experimental model of ms, and lean zucker rats (fa/fa) were used for reference values. the habitual exercise (performed by the obese rats) consisted of treadmill running: 5 days/week for 14 weeks, at 35 cm/s for 35 min in the last month. the acute exercise consisted of a single session of 25-35 min at 35 cm/s. circulating concentrations of il-6 (a cytokine that regulates the inflammatory and metabolic responses), crp (a systemic inflammatory marker), and corticosterone (ctc) (the main glucocorticoid in rats) were determined by elisa, and that of noradrenaline (na) was determined by hplc. glucose was determined by standard methods.resultsthe genetically obese animals showed higher circulating levels of glucose, il-6, pcr, and na compared with the control lean animals. the habitual exercise program increased the concentration of il-6, pcr, na, and glucose, but decreased that of ctc. acute exercise increased il-6, crp, and na in the sedentary obese animals, but not in the trained obese animals. ctc was increased after the acute exercise in the trained animals only.conclusionanimals with ms present a dysregulation in the feedback mechanism between il-6 and na which can contribute to the systemic low-grade inflammation and/or hyperglycaemia of ms. an inappropriate exercise intensity can worsen this dysregulation, contributing to the metabolic, inflammatory, and stress disorders associated with ms. habitual exercise (i.e., training) induces a positive adaptation in the response to acute exercise.
motor cortex bilateral motor representation depends on subcortical and interhemispheric interactions in conclusion, the rat primary motor cortex appears to be organized into irregularly shaped patches of cortex devoted to particular movements. the location of major subdivisions such as the forelimb or hindlimb areas is somatotopic and is consistent from animal to animal, but the internal organization of the pattern of movements represented within major subdivisions varies significantly between animals. the motor cortex includes both agranular primary motor cortex (agl) and, in addition, a significant amount of the bordering granular somatic sensory cortex (gr(si)), as well as the rostral portion of the taste sensory insular or claustrocortex (cl). the rat frontal cortex also contains a second, rostral motor representation of the forelimb, trunk and hindlimb, which is somatotopically organized and may be the rat's supplementary motor area. both of these motor representations give rise to direct corticospinal projections, some of which may make monosynaptic connections with cervical enlargement motoneurons. medial to the primary motor cortex, in cytoarchitectonic field agm, is what appears to be part of the rat's frontal eye fields, a region which also includes the vibrissae motor representation. the somatic motor cortical output organization pattern in the rat is remarkably similar to that seen in the primate, whose primary, supplementary and frontal eye field cortical motor regions have been extensively studied.
no fixed item limit in visuospatial working memory the process of encoding a visual scene into working memory has previously been studied using binary measures of recall. here, we examine the temporal evolution of memory resolution, based on observers' ability to reproduce the orientations of objects presented in brief, masked displays. recall precision was accurately described by the interaction of two independent constraints: an encoding limit that determines the maximum rate at which information can be transferred into memory and a separate storage limit that determines the maximum fidelity with which information can be maintained. recall variability decreased incrementally with time, consistent with a parallel encoding process in which visual information from multiple objects accumulates simultaneously in working memory. no evidence was observed for a limit on the number of items stored. cuing one display item with a brief flash led to rapid development of a recall advantage for that item. this advantage was short-lived if the cue was simply a salient visual event but was maintained if it indicated an object of particular relevance to the task. these cuing effects were observed even for items that had already been encoded into memory, indicating that limited memory resources can be rapidly reallocated to prioritize salient or goal-relevant information.
effect of supplementation of the maternal diet with fish oil or linseed oil on fatty-acid composition and expression of δ5- and δ6-desaturase in tissues of female piglets. the purpose of the present study was to compare the influence of adding no or 8% fat of varying sources (coconut oil, fish oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil) to diets for sows 1 week prior to farrowing and during lactation on the composition of fatty acids in plasma and tissues of the progeny while sucking and 3 weeks after weaning from the sow. a control diet without supplemental fat and four diets supplemented with 8% of coconut oil, rapeseed oil, fish oil or sunflower oil were provided to lactating sows (n = 15), and during the post-weaning period the same weaner diet was provided to all piglets (n = 15 litters), which were housed litterwise. the dietary ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids of the maternal diets largely influenced the progeny, as the ratio varying from 1.2 (fish oil) to 12.2 (sunflower oil) in the sow milk was reflected in plasma and adipose tissues of the sucking progeny. the liver showed similar variations according to dietary treatments, but a lower n-6:n-3 fatty acids ratio. from day 4 to later on during the suckling period, the concentration of c14:0, c16:0 and c18:1 in the liver of the piglets decreased, irrespective of the dietary treatments of sows. in plasma and liver, the total concentration of saturated fatty acids (safa), monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) did not differ markedly in piglets sucking sows fed different dietary fatty acids, whereas the adipose tissue of piglets sucking sows fed sunflower oil and coconut oil showed the highest proportion of pufa and safa, respectively. weaning lowered the concentration of lipid-soluble extracts in plasma and the concentration of fatty acids in the liver of the piglets. within the post-weaning period, dietary treatments of sows, rather than age of piglets, influenced the fatty acid composition of plasma and adipose tissue of the piglets, whereas the hepatic fatty acid profile was more affected by the age of the piglets during the post-weaning period. this study shows that the fatty acid profile of plasma and tissues of the progeny is highly dependent on the maternal dietary composition, and that the dietary impact persists for up to 3 weeks after the suckling period.
microevolution of pandemic vibrio parahaemolyticus assessed by the number of repeat units in short sequence tandem repeat regions we identified seven distinct subtypes of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 isolates that were derived from sporadic cases and outbreaks from multiple prefectures in japan in 2005. a surveillance system utilizing pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), pulsenet japan, was used. some strains showed indistinguishable pfge patterns using another restriction enzyme (blni or spei) in each subtype of ehec o157:h7 isolates that were routinely subtyped by the xbai pfge pattern. in order to examine the genotypic relatedness of these strains, we carried out a multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (vntr) analysis (mlva). by using the mlva system, we found that three of seven subtypes of ehec o157:h7 strains that were isolated from sporadic cases dispersed across multiple prefectures within a few months showed indistinguishable pfge patterns and identical mlva types. strains belonging to the other four subtypes of ehec o157:h7 in the pfge analysis were further classified into different clusters of ehec o157:h7. therefore, compared to pfge, mlva showed greater discriminatory power with respect to analysis of the isolates in this study.
lack of an adverse effect of giardia intestinalis infection on the health of peruvian children. in a peri-urban shanty town in lima, peru, that was hyperendemic for giardia lamblia, 44 children aged between 0.9 months and 10 years were effectively treated for giardia lamblia with tinidazole. stools were examined weekly in the 6 months after treatment to determine the rate of reinfection, and after reinfection stools continued to be examined. 98% of the children became reinfected with giardia lamblia within 6 months, and after reinfection stool excretion of the parasite lasted a mean (sd) of 3.2 (3.3) months. the children's mean stool ph and their mean stool fat index was unaffected by giardia lamblia reinfection. treatment of all symptomless giardia lamblia infections in a developing country hyperendemic for the disease is of questionable value because of rapid reinfection.
isolated mammalian and schizosaccharomyces pombe ran-binding domains rescue s. pombe sbp1 (ranbp1) genomic mutants. the murine htf9-a/ranbp1 and htf9-c genes are divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. the htf9-a gene encodes the ranbp1 protein, a major partner of the ran gtpase. the divergently transcribed htf9-c gene encodes a protein sharing similarity with yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes. we report here that both mrna species produced by the htf9-associated genes are regulated during the cell cycle progression, peak in s phase and decrease during mitosis. transient expression experiments with reporter constructs showed that cell cycle expression is controlled at the transcriptional level, because the bidirectional htf9 promoter is down-regulated in growth-arrested cells, is activated at the g1/s transition and reaches maximal activity in s phase, though with a different efficiency for each orientation. we have delimited specific promoter regions controlling s phase activity in one or both orientations: identified elements contain recognition sites for members belonging to both the e2f and sp1 families of transcription factors. together, the results suggest that the sharing of the regulatory region supports co-regulation of the htf9-a/ranbp1 and htf9-c genes in a common window of the cell cycle.
motor sequence learning in the elderly: differential activity patterns as a function of hand modality neural networks of motor control are well understood and the motor domain therefore lends itself to the study of learning. neuroimaging of motor learning has demonstrated fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar involvement. however, there is conflicting evidence on the specific functional contributions of individual regions and their relative importance for early and advanced stages of learning. using functional mri (fmri), we examined hemodynamic effects in seven right-handed men during brief episodes of explicit learning of novel six-digit sequences (experiments 1 and 2) and during prolonged learning of an eight-digit sequence (experiment 3), all performed with the dominant hand. brief episodes of new learning were predominantly associated with bilateral activations in premotor and supplementary motor areas, superior and inferior parietal cortices, and anterior cerebellum. in experiment 2, which included a control condition matched for complexity of motor execution, we also found unexpectedly strong activation in the bilateral inferior frontal lobes. in experiment 3, analysis of task by learning stage interactions showed greater involvement of the bilateral superior parietal lobes, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left caudate nucleus during early stages, whereas left occipito-temporal and superior frontal cortex as well as the bilateral parahippocampal region were more activated during late learning stages. analysis of task by performance interactions (based on each subject's response times and accuracy during each scan) showed effects in bilateral fronto-polar, right hippocampal, and anterior cerebellar regions associated with high levels of performance, as well as inverse effects in bilateral occipito-parietal regions. we conclude that superior parietal and occipital regions are most intensely involved in visually driven explicit digit sequence learning during early stages and low performance, whereas later stages of acquisition and higher levels of performance are characterized by stronger recruitment of prefrontal and mediotemporal regions.
effects of integrin-mediated cell adhesion on plasma membrane lipid raft components and signaling lipid rafts and caveolae are specialized membrane microdomains implicated in regulating g protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. previous studies have suggested that rafts/caveolae may regulate β-adrenergic receptor/gαs signaling, but underlying molecular mechanisms are largely undefined. using a simplified model system in c6 glioma cells, this study disrupts rafts/caveolae using both pharmacological and genetic approaches to test whether caveolin-1 and lipid microdomains regulate gs trafficking and signaling. lipid rafts/caveolae were disrupted in c6 cells by either short-term cholesterol chelation using methyl-β-cyclodextrin or by stable knockdown of caveolin-1 and -2 by rna interference. in imaging studies examining gαs-gfp during signaling, stimulation with the βar agonist isoproterenol resulted in internalization of gαs-gfp; however, this trafficking was blocked by methyl-β-cyclodextrin or by caveolin knockdown. caveolin knockdown significantly decreased gαs localization in detergent insoluble lipid raft/caveolae membrane fractions, suggesting that caveolin localizes a portion of gαs to these membrane microdomains. methyl-β-cyclodextrin or caveolin knockdown significantly increased isoproterenol or thyrotropin-stimulated camp accumulation. furthermore, forskolin- and aluminum tetrafluoride-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly increased by caveolin knockdown in cells or in brain membranes obtained from caveolin-1 knockout mice, indicating that caveolin attenuates signaling at the level of gαs/adenylyl cyclase and distal to gpcrs. taken together, these results demonstrate that caveolin-1 and lipid microdomains exert a major effect on gαs trafficking and signaling. it is suggested that lipid rafts/caveolae are sites that remove gαs from membrane signaling cascades and caveolins might dampen globally gαs/adenylyl cyclase/camp signaling.
in situ transformations of fine lead oxide particles in different soils. contamination of shooting range soils from the use of pb bullets is under increasing scrutiny. past research on pb contamination of shooting ranges has focused on weathering reactions of pb bullets in soil. the objective of this study was to determine the significance of abrasion of pb bullets in contributing to soil pb contamination. this was accomplished by firing a known mass of bullets into sand and analyzing for total pb after removing bullets, through field sampling of a newly opened shooting range, and a laboratory weathering study. forty-one mg of pb were abraded per bullet as it passed through the sand, which accounted for 1.5% of the bullet mass being physically removed. at a shooting range that had been open for 3 months, the highest pb concentration from the pistol range berm soil was 193 mg/kg at 0.5 m height, and from the rifle range berm soil was 1142 mg/kg at 1.0 m height. most soils from the field abrasion experiment as well as soil collected from the rifle range had splp-pb >15 microg/l (synthetic precipitation leaching procedure). typically, pb concentration in the rifle range was greater than that of the pistol range. based on a laboratory weathering study, virtually all metallic pb was converted to hydrocerussite (pb3(co3)2(oh)2), as well as to a lesser extent cerussite (pbco3) and massicot (pbo) within one week. our study demonstrated that abrasion of lead bullets and their subsequent weathering can be a significant source of lead contamination in soils of a newly opened shooting range.
surgical outcome of a repeat midurethral sling procedure after failure of a first procedure background data about the use of tension-free vaginal tape (tvt) in the management of recurrent urodynamic stress incontinence (rusi) after previous failed midurethral sling procedure (musp) are limited.   objective assessment of the efficacy and the indications of the tvt procedure in the management of patients with rusi after failed previous musp.   design, setting, and participants thirty-one patients with rusi after previous failed musp were prospectively enrolled at a single tertiary academic center.   measurements preoperatively and postoperatively, patients were assessed with physical examination, urinalysis, urine culture, bladder diary for 2-3 d, q-tip test, uroflow, filling and voiding cystometry, urethral profilometry, and 1-h pad test. mean follow-up was at 18.6 mo (range: 12-28 mo).   results and limitations overall, the objective cure rate based on the pad test findings was 74%, the improvement rate was 6.5%, and the failure rate was 19.5%. the objective cure rate based on cough stress test during filling cystometry was 77.4%, and the subjective cure rate based on patients' answers was 71%. the study could have some limitations. the relatively small number of patients enrolled could affect the findings of study to some degree. additionally, because urethral pressure profiles show a significant degree of directional dependence when side-hole microtip transducers are used, as in the present study, the orientation of the transducer could affect the values measured.   conclusions the tvt procedure as a second operation could provide an overall cure rate of 74% with a low complication rate in female patients with rusi after previous failed midurethral tape procedures.
does farming have an effect on health status? a comparison study in west greece comparing agricultural cohorts with the general population is challenging because the general healthiness of farmers may mask potential adverse health effects of farming. using data from the agricultural health study, a cohort of 89,656 pesticide applicators and their spouses (n = 89, 656) in north carolina and iowa, the authors computed standardized mortality ratios (smrs) comparing deaths from time of the enrollment (1993-1997) through 2007 to state-specific rates. to compensate for the cohort's overall healthiness, relative smrs were estimated by calculating the smr for each cause relative to the smr for all other causes. in 1,198,129 person-years of follow-up, 6,419 deaths were observed. the all-cause mortality rate was less than expected (smr(applicators) = 0.54, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.52, 0.55; smr(spouses) = 0.52, 95% ci: 0.50, 0.55). smrs for all cancers, heart disease, and diabetes were significantly below 1.0. in contrast, applicators experienced elevated numbers of machine-related deaths (smr = 4.15, 95% ci: 3.18, 5.31), motor vehicle nontraffic accidents (smr = 2.80, 95% ci: 1.81, 4.14), and collisions with objects (smr = 2.12, 95% ci: 1.25, 3.34). in the relative smr analysis for applicators, the relative mortality ratio was elevated for lymphohematopoietic cancers, melanoma, and digestive system, prostate, kidney, and brain cancers. among spouses, relative smrs exceeded 1.0 for lymphohematopoietic cancers and malignancies of the digestive system, brain, breast, and ovary. unintentional fatal injuries remain an important risk for farmers; mortality ratios from several cancers were elevated relative to other causes.
quantitative in vivo redox sensors uncover oxidative stress as an early event in life. to explore the role of mitochondrial activity in the aging process, we have lowered the activity of the electron transport chain and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (atp) synthase with rna interference (rnai) in caenorhabditis elegans. these perturbations reduced body size and behavioral rates and extended adult life-span. restoring messenger rna to near-normal levels during adulthood did not elevate atp levels and did not correct any of these phenotypes. conversely, inhibiting respiratory-chain components during adulthood only did not reset behavioral rates and did not affect life-span. thus, the developing animal appears to contain a regulatory system that monitors mitochondrial activity early in life and, in response, establishes rates of respiration, behavior, and aging that persist during adulthood.
prolonged nicotine dependence associated with extended access to nicotine self-administration in rats considering the importance of self-administration models in determining mechanisms of drug maintained behavior, we attempted to replicate the findings of nicotine self-administration by corrigall and coen. male, sprague-dawley rats, trained on food reinforcement, acquired relatively high and stable rates of self-administration of iv nicotine bitartrate (0.03 mg/kg, free base). extinction and reacquisition followed substituting saline and then nicotine, respectively. responses, infusions and intake decreased at 0.003 mg/kg, while intake increased at 0.06 mg/kg. this model of nicotine self-administration provides a reliable alternative to experimenter-administration models for examining the effects of nicotine.
mir-451 inhibits cell growth and invasion by targeting mif and is associated with survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma background: tumor microenvironments affect the progression of cancers. results: we demonstrated that th17 cells were accumulated in tumor tissues, and the tumor-derived mif induced th17 cell accumulation and had clinical relevance in npc. conclusion: the cytokine mif regulates intratumoral th17 cell expansion and has prognostic value for npc patients. significance: the tumor microenvironment influences the clinical prognosis of npc patients. the accumulation of an intratumoral cd4+ interleukin-17-producing subset (th17) of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils) is a general characteristic in many cancers. the relationship between the percentage of th17 cells and clinical prognosis differs among cancers. the mechanism responsible for the increasing percentage of such cells in npc is still unknown, as is their biological function. here, our data showed an increase of th17 cells in tumor tissues relative to their numbers in normal nasopharynx tissues or in the matched peripheral blood of npc patients. th17 cells in tumor tissue produced more ifnγ than did those in the peripheral blood of matched npc patients and healthy controls. we observed high levels of cd154, g-csf, cxcl1, il-6, il-8, and macrophage inhibitory factor (mif) out of 36 cytokines examined in tumor tissue cultures. mif promoted the generation and recruitment of th17 cells mediated by npc tumor cells in vitro; this promoting effect was mainly dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and was mediated by the mif-cxcr4 axis. finally, the expression level of mif in tumor cells and in tils was positively correlated in npc tumor tissues, and the frequency of mif-positive tils was positively correlated with npc patient clinical outcomes. taken together, our findings illustrate that tumor-derived mif can affect patient prognosis, which might be related to the increase of th17 cells in the npc tumor microenvironment.
detection of brucella melitensis dna in the milk of sheep after abortion by pcr assay the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to diagnose goat brucellosis and compare its sensitivity against some of the most commonly used serological and bacteriological techniques. twenty two female and one male out of 300 clinically healthy, mixed-breed goats were randomly chosen from a ranch located at marín, nuevo león, mexico. milk and blood samples were taken from each animal and used to obtain both microbiological cultures and dna of the pathogen, and sera was tested against rose bengal antigen (rbt). results showed that 86% of the blood samples were positive on the pcr test, while 60% were positive on the serological test. the pathogen was isolated from only one blood culture. sixty four percent of the milk samples were positive on pcr tests, but failed to yield bacteria in culture. biochemical and pcr specific assay demonstrated that brucella abortus biovar 1 was associated with the infection. this study demonstrates the higher sensitivity of pcr over rbt and blood culture and its potential towards a rapid identification of brucella strains.
association of interarm systolic blood pressure difference with atherosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy background knowledge of the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (pad) in patients with chronic renal failure (crf) is limited because of a lack of uniformity in disease definition and recognition. furthermore, little is known of the prevalence of medial arterial calcification (mac) in patients with crf. our goal is to study the prevalence of pad and mac defined by ankle brachial index (abi) or toe brachial index (tbi) measurements in a finnish population of patients with crf consisting of predialysis and dialysis patients, as well as renal transplant recipients.   methods we examined 136 patients with crf and 59 control subjects. fifty-nine of the patients with crf had moderate to severe predialysis crf, 36 patients were on dialysis treatment, and 41 were renal transplant recipients. mean age of patients was 51.9 +/- 11.5 years, and 39 patients (29%) had diabetes. abi and tbi were measured by means of photoplethysmography. the definition of pad required an abi value of 0.90 or less, a tbi value of 0.60 or less, or a previous positive lower-extremity angiogram result. abi values of 1.3 or greater or incompressible arteries at ankle level indicated mac. the presence of claudication was determined by an interview.   results prevalences of pad on this study were 22.0% in patients with predialysis crf, 30.6% in patients on dialysis treatment, 14.6% in renal transplant recipients, and 1.7% in the control group (p = 0.001). prevalences of mac were 23.7%, 41.7%, 23.1%, and 3.4% (p < 0.001), respectively. only 9 patients had claudication, and 6 of those patients had pad.   conclusion both asymptomatic pad and mac are common in patients with crf. therefore, we recommend the use of both abi and tbi measurements in the evaluation of pad in patients with crf.
inositol triphosphate participates in an oestradiol nongenomic signalling pathway involved in accelerated oviductal transport in cycling rats. abstract this investigation examined the role of estrogen receptor (er) on the stimulatory effect of estradiol (e2) on protein phosphorylation in the oviduct as well as on e2-induced acceleration of oviductal oocyte transport in cyclic rats. estrous rats were injected with e2 s.c. and with the er antagonist ici 182 780 intrabursally (i.b.), and 6 h later, oviducts were excised and protein phosphorylation was determined by western blot analysis. ici 182 780 inhibited the e2-induced phosphorylation of some oviductal proteins. other estrous rats were treated with e2 s.c. and ici 182 780 i.b. the number of eggs in the oviduct, assessed 24 h later, showed that ici 182 780 blocked the e2-induced egg transport acceleration. the possible involvement of adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase a (pk-a), protein kinase c (pk-c), or tyrosine kinases on egg transport acceleration induced by e2 was then examined. selective inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase or pk-a inhibited the e2-induced egg transport acceleration, whereas pk-c or tyrosine kinase inhibitors had no effect. furthermore, forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, mimicked the effect of e2 on ovum transport and e2 increased the level of camp in the oviduct of cycling rats. finally, we measured pk-a activity in vitro in the presence of e2 or e2-er complex. activity of pk-a in the presence of e2 or e2-er was similar to pk-a alone, showing that e2 or e2-er did not directly activate pk-a. we conclude that the nongenomic pathway by which e2 accelerates oviductal egg transport in the rat requires absolute participation of er and camp and partial participation of pk-a signaling pathways in the oviduct.
decoding the neural representation of affective states previous functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the amygdala activates in response to fearful faces presented below the threshold of conscious visual perception. using a backward masking procedure similar to that of previous studies, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to study the amygdala and anterior cingulate gyrus during preattentive presentations of sad and happy facial affect. twelve healthy adult females underwent blood oxygen level dependent (bold) fmri while viewing sad and happy faces, each presented for 20 ms and "masked" immediately by a neutral face for 100 ms. masked happy faces were associated with significant bilateral activation within the anterior cingulate gyrus and amygdala, whereas masked sadness yielded only limited activation within the left anterior cingulate gyrus. in a direct comparison, masked happy faces yielded significantly greater activation in the anterior cingulate and amygdala relative to identically masked sad faces. conjunction analysis showed that masked affect perception, regardless of emotional valence, was associated with greater activation within the left amygdala and left anterior cingulate. findings suggest that the amygdala and anterior cingulate are important components of a network involved in detecting and discriminating affective information presented below the normal threshold of conscious visual perception.
comparison of four pcr methods for efficient detection of trypanosoma cruzi in routine diagnostics. an international study was performed by 26 experienced pcr laboratories from 14 countries to assess the performance of duplex quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) strategies on the basis of taqman probes for detection and quantification of parasitic loads in peripheral blood samples from chagas disease patients. two methods were studied: satellite dna (satdna) qpcr and kinetoplastid dna (kdna) qpcr. both methods included an internal amplification control. reportable range, analytical sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification, and precision were estimated according to international guidelines. in addition, inclusivity and exclusivity were estimated with dna from stocks representing the different trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units and trypanosoma rangeli and leishmania spp. both methods were challenged against 156 blood samples provided by the participant laboratories, including samples from acute and chronic patients with varied clinical findings, infected by oral route or vectorial transmission. kdna qpcr showed better analytical sensitivity than satdna qpcr with limits of detection of 0.23 and 0.70 parasite equivalents/ml, respectively. analyses of clinical samples revealed a high concordance in terms of sensitivity and parasitic loads determined by both satdna and kdna qpcrs. this effort is a major step toward international validation of qpcr methods for the quantification of t. cruzi dna in human blood samples, aiming to provide an accurate surrogate biomarker for diagnosis and treatment monitoring for patients with chagas disease.
influence of obesity and body fat distribution on postprandial lipemia and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in adult women. apoliprotein (apo) b-100-containing very low density lipoprotein (vldl) particles secreted from the liver accumulate in plasma during alimentary lipemia. to determine whether changes of vldl composition occur in the postprandial state that may render these lipoproteins more atherogenic, apoe, c-i, c-ii, and c-iii, and lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol) were measured in svedberg flotation (sf) 60-400 (large) and sf 20-60 (small) vldl before and after an oral fat load. ten normotriglyceridemic (ntg) and three hypertriglyceridemic (htg) healthy men were given a fat-rich mixed meal (1,000 kcal with 60.2 e% from fat). triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from plasma samples obtained before (fasting) and at 2-h intervals after the meal. vldl was then separated from chylomicrons and their remnants by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies 4g3 and 5e11, recognizing apob-100, but not apob-48 epitopes. large and small vldl isolated from the ntg group were enriched with apoe and c-i, and cholesterol, but depleted of apoc-ii in the postprandial state, whereas the apoc-iii, triglyceride, and phospholipid contents were essentially unchanged. the compositional changes of vldl in htg subjects were similar but more pronounced compared with ntg subjects. we conclude that postprandial lipemia in healthy men induces transient compositional alterations of vldl that link these lipoprotein species to the formation of atherosclerosis.
the stroop effect in kana and kanji scripts in native japanese speakers: an fmri study in order to separate the cognitive processes associated with phonological encoding and the use of a visual word form lexicon in reading, it is desirable to compare the processing of words presented in a visually familiar form with words in a visually unfamiliar form. japanese kana orthography offers this possibility. two phonologically equivalent but visually dissimilar syllabaries allow the writing of, for example, foreign loanwords in two ways, only one of which is visually familiar. familiarly written words, unfamiliarly written words, and pseudowords were presented in both kana syllabaries (yielding six conditions in total) to participants during an fmri measurement with a silent articulation task (experiment 1) and a phonological lexical decision task (experiment 2) using an event-related design. consistent over two experimental tasks, the three different stimulus types (familiar, unfamiliar, and pseudoword) were found to activate selectively different brain regions previously associated with phonological encoding and word retrieval or meaning. compatible with the predictions of the dual-route model for reading, pseudowords and visually unfamiliar words, which have to be read using phonological assembly, caused an increase in brain activity in left inferior frontal regions (ba 44/47), as compared to visually familiar words. visually familiar and unfamiliar words were found to activate a range of areas associated with lexico-semantic processing more strongly than pseudowords, such as the left and right temporo-parietal region (ba 39/40), a region in the left middle/inferior temporal gyrus (ba 20/21), and the posterior cingulate (ba 31).
electroencephalographic characteristics of cognitive-specific alerting attention in verbal learning: iii. localized characteristics of eeg spatial synchronization electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 subjects (students) in states of: rest with the eyes open; memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (latin and russian); and recollection (control) of the memorized information. estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared using statistical methods for the frequency bands θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ. the results of this comparison showed that transition from the state of rest to those of memorization and recollection was accompanied by numerous changes in coherence in all the frequency bands. these changes varied in intensity and embrace practically the entire convexital cerebral cortex. decrease in eeg coherence was predominant during the transition to the memorization state in various frequency bands, whereas during the transition from the rest state to that of recollection, eeg coherence increased in most of the frequency bands except for the band α2. the reproducibility of this pattern of changes in eeg coherence is confirmed by the results in the subgroups formed by randomly subdividing the subjects into two groups. we think that the observed intense rearrangement of the spatial synchronization of the cortex electrical activity reflects the reorganization of the functional systems of neuronal ensembles to provide efficient memorization and recollection, respectively.
characteristics of human corneal psychophysical channels. 1 the cornea of human subjects and of anaesthetised cats was stimulated with a jet of air of controlled flow, temperature and co2 concentration delivered by a gas aesthesiometer. 2 in humans, the intensity and magnitude of various components of the sensory experience (intensity of the sensation, degree of irritation, magnitude of burning and stinging pain, magnitude of the cold and warm components of the sensation) were measured using separate visual analog scales. in anaesthetised cats, the impulse response to the same stimuli was recorded from single mechanosensory, polymodal and cold‐sensitive corneal fibres in the ciliary nerves. 3 intensity‐response curves for mechanical stimulation showed that all parameters of the sensation experienced by humans increased with the intensity of the stimulus. mechanical stimuli recruited mainly phasic mechanosensory and polymodal afferents in the cat. 4 acidic stimulation with gas mixtures of increasing co2 concentration evoked irritation, burning and to a lesser extent stinging pain of a magnitude roughly proportional to the intensity of the stimulus in humans. co2 primarily recruited polymodal afferents and weakly excited cold‐sensitive fibres in the cat's cornea. 5 heat stimuli evoked in humans a sensation profile similar to co2 but accompanied by a warmth component. in the cat's cornea, heat excited only polymodal fibres and silenced cold‐sensitive corneal units. 6 cold stimuli applied to the human cornea elicited a sensation of cooling that became irritant at the lowest temperatures. corneal cold‐sensitive fibres of the cat were activated in a manner proportional to the temperature drop, while polymodal nociceptor fibres were recruited only by the lowest temperatures. topical menthol (0.2 mm) applied to humans evoked and later eliminated cold sensations produced by cold stimuli while the irritation sensation caused by low temperature stimuli still persisted. 7 human subjects were able to identify masked mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli applied to the cornea. 8 irritation and cold sensations can therefore be evoked separately from the cornea by selective activation of mechanosensory, polymodal and cold corneal sensory afferents. stimulation with different forms of energy usually leads to combined activation and/or inhibition of the different populations of sensory afferent fibres, evoking blended sensations that include irritation and thermal components in a variable degree.
skin elasticity as a measure of radiation fibrosis purpose to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of various signs of late morbidity, their time of appearance and pattern of progression during an observation period up to 34 years in breast cancer patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy after radical mastectomy.   methods and materials a group of 71 breast cancer patients received in 1963-1965 aggressive postoperative telecobalt therapy to the parasternal, axillary, and supraclavicular lymph node regions after total mastectomy and axillary clearance. none of the patients received chemotherapy either prior to, or after the irradiation as part of their primary treatment. the prescribed dose to the three lymph node regions was 44 gy in 11 fractions. only two of the three fields were treated per day. this total dose was given in 16-17 fractions over 3-4 weeks. because of the overlap of the supraclavicular and axillary fields, the dose received by the brachial plexus was not the dose that was prescribed. a retrospective dose calculation showed that the total dose to the brachial plexus was 57 gy, delivered as a complex combination of 1.8 gy, 3.4 gy, and 5.2 gy fractions. this cohort of patients has now been followed to 34 years and the late side effects of the treatment evaluated and scored.   results this series is unique in the literature. there is no comparable report of a detailed long-term follow-up in a homogeneously treated group of patients with such a high survival, especially among the younger women, where it is almost 50% at 30 years. this is the reason that they were able to develop some of the very slowly evolving injuries. there was progression of many of the late effects in the period between 5 and 34 years. the more serious morbidities have increased progressively over the whole 34-year follow-up period. ninety-two percent of the long-term survivors have paralysis of their arm. other neurological findings included unilateral vocal cord paralysis among 5% of the patients, who developed the disease after a median time of 19 years. all of them were left-sided, indicating a mediastinal involvement of the recurrent nerve. local recurrence or the appearance of a new primary tumor infiltrating or causing pressure on the recurrent nerve were vigorously investigated and excluded as possible causes of these symptoms.   conclusion the greatest risk for all cancer patients is the inadequate treatment of their disease, because this is inevitably lethal. the aggressiveness of the therapy and the acceptable risk of complications must therefore be balanced against the risk of recurrence. the neuropathy seems to be closely linked to the development of fibrosis around the nerve trunks. the use of large daily fractions, combined with hot spots from overlapping fields contributed to the severity of the complications.
predictors of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with acute venous thrombo-embolism: the swiss venous thromboembolism registry (swivter). while the magnitude of venous thromboembolism (vte) increases dramatically with advancing age, relatively little is known about the contemporary management of vte in the elderly and the impact of age on associated short- and long-term outcomes. the objectives of this population-based study were to compare the clinical characteristics, treatment practices, and outcomes of subjects > or = 65 years with vte to those of younger patients. the medical records of residents of the worcester (ma, usa) metropolitan area with icd-9 codes consistent with vte during 1999, 2001, and 2003 were independently validated and reviewed by trained data abstractors. information about patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, hospital management practices, and hospital and long-term outcomes was collected. there were a total of 1,897 validated events of vte - 1,048 (55%) occurred in patients > or = 65 years of age. patients > or = 65 years were less likely to have "unprovoked" vte than younger patients. they were less likely to receive parenteral anticoagulation or warfarin as acute treatment. rates of recurrent vte did not differ significantly between patients 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients but the adjusted rates of major bleeding were increased approximately two-fold in older patients. in conclusion, advancing age is not a predictor of recurrent vte but is associated with a significant increase in major bleeding episodes. physicians treating elderly patients with vte should continue to base their decisions on clinical characteristics previously shown to impact the risk of recurrent vte. these decisions must be tempered by our observation that major bleeding occurs frequently in these patients.
inhibition of verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli in model broth and rumen systems by carvacrol and thymol. the effect of mint (mentha piperita) essential oil (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0%, v/w) on salmonella enteritidis and listeria monocytogenes in a culture medium and three model foods; tzatziki (ph 4.5), taramosalata (ph 5.0) and pâté (ph 6.8), inoculated at 10(7) cfu g-1, at 4 degrees and 10 degrees c for ca 1 week was studied. in the culture medium supplemented with the essential oil, no growth was observed over 2 d at 30 degrees c determined by a conductance method with a malthus 2000 growth analyser. salmonella enteritidis died in tzatziki in all treatments and declined in the other foods except for pâté at 10 degrees c as judged with viable counts. listeria monocytogenes populations showed a declining trend towards the end of the storage period but was increased in pâté. mint essential oil antibacterial action depended mainly on its concentration, food ph, composition, storage temperature and the nature of the micro-organism.
reference values for pulmonary diffusing capacity for adult native finns ### 1.1 what is being measured  the lung is the organ of external respiration for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the surrounding air. the stages in the process of gas transfer include:  1. ventilation of the airways and some air spaces by bulk flow of gas;  2. mixing and diffusion of gases in the alveolar ducts, air sacs and alveoli;  3. transfer of gases across the gaseous to liquid interface of the alveolar membrane;  4. mixing and diffusion in the lung parenchyma and alveolar capillary plasma;  5. chemical reaction with constituents of blood;  6. circulation of blood between the pulmonary and systemic vascular beds.  the capacity of the lung to exchange gas is determined by the structural and functional dimensions of these processes. the structural dimensions include the lung volume, the path length for diffusion in the gas phase, the thickness and area of the alveolar capillary membrane including any effects of airway closure, and the volume of blood in capillaries supplying alveoli which are ventilated. the principal functional dimensions are the absolute levels of ventilation and perfusion and the uniformity of their distribution with respect to both each other and the diffusion characteristics of the membrane. other functional dimensions are the quantity of haemoglobin in the alveolar capillaries, the composition of the alveolar gas, the gas tensions in blood entering the alveolar capillaries, the rates of chemical reaction with haemoglobin and of dissociation of the compound so formed, the transit time of blood through that part of the pulmonary vascular bed which exchanges gas with the alveoli and the slope of the relevant haemoglobin dissociation curve. the latter is a function of the temperature of the lung and the prevailing levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; many of these variables are dependent on the level of …
rasosomes originate from the golgi to dispense ras signals we identify a role for the gdi-like solubilizing factor (gsf) pdeδ in modulating signalling through ras family g proteins by sustaining their dynamic distribution in cellular membranes. we show that the gdi-like pocket of pdeδ binds and solubilizes farnesylated ras proteins, thereby enhancing their diffusion in the cytoplasm. this mechanism allows more effective trapping of depalmitoylated ras proteins at the golgi and polycationic ras proteins at the plasma membrane to counter the entropic tendency to distribute these proteins over all intracellular membranes. thus, pdeδ activity augments k/hras signalling by enriching ras at the plasma membrane; conversely, pdeδ down-modulation randomizes ras distributions to all membranes in the cell and suppresses regulated signalling through wild-type ras and also constitutive oncogenic ras signalling in cancer cells. our findings link the activity of pdeδ in determining ras protein topography to ras-dependent signalling.
outcome of microdissection tese compared with conventional tese in non‐obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
effects of uncertainty and target displacement on the latency of express saccades in man backgroundpredictions from conduction velocity data for primate retinal ganglion cell axons indicate that the conduction time to the lateral geniculate nucleus for stimulation of peripheral retina should be no longer than for stimulation of central retina. on this basis, the latency of saccadic eye movements should not increase for more peripherally located targets. however, previous studies have reported relatively very large increases, which has the implication of a very considerable increase in central processing time for the saccade-generating system.resultsin order to resolve this paradox, we have undertaken an extended series of experiments in which saccadic eye movements were recorded by electro-oculography in response to targets presented in the horizontal meridian in normal young subjects. for stationary or moving targets of either normal beam intensity or reduced red intensity, with the direction of gaze either straight ahead with respect to the head or directed eccentrically, the saccadic latency was shown to remain invariant with respect to a wide range of target angular displacements.conclusionsthese results indicate that, irrespective of the angular displacement of the target, the direction of gaze or the target intensity, the saccade-generating system operates with a constant generation time.
hemispatial neglect and visual search: a large scale analysis patients with hemispatial neglect fail to respond to stimuli on one side of space. we assessed to what extent the complexity and number of visual stimuli on both sides determine the severity of neglect. patients with neglect were required to find specified targets in a cluttered visual field. two sets of stimuli were used. one set produced effortless and parallel search performance in normal controls; the other set was more complex and produced serial search performance in normal controls. both sets of stimuli resulted in a serial performance pattern in the patients. their baseline search performance on both sides was similar when all stimulus items were restricted to one side. a pronounced difference between the two sides was evident when stimuli appeared on both sides. search for targets on the intact side of space was unaffected by distractors on the neglected side, whereas search for targets on the neglected side was slowed disproportionately by distractors on the intact side. the slowing on the neglected side was more severe during the more demanding search task and when more items were present on the intact side. the results indicate that neglect is associated with an inability to move attention from objects on the intact side to items on the neglected side.
canine cnga3 gene mutations provide novel insights into human achromatopsia-associated channelopathies and treatment cone degeneration (cd ) is an autosomal recessive canine disease that occurs naturally in the alaskan malamute and german shorthaired pointer breeds. it is phenotypically similar to human achromatopsia, a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder associated with three distinct loci. both the canine disease and its human counterparts are characterized by day-blindness and absence of retinal cone function in adults. we report linkage of the canine cd locus to marker c29.002 on canine chromosome 29 at recombination fraction theta = 0.0 with a maximum lod score of 24.68 in a series of informative outbred pedigrees derived from cd-affected alaskan malamutes. conserved gene order between cfa29 and the long arm of human chromosome 8 argued for homology between the cd locus and the human achromatopsia locus, achm3, at 8q21-22. the canine homolog of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta-subunit gene (cngb3), responsible for the human achm3 disease phenotype, was mapped within the zero-recombination interval for the cd locus. a deletion removing all exons of canine cngb3 was identified in cd-affected alaskan malamute-derived dogs. a missense mutation in exon 6 (d262n, nucleotide 784) within a conserved region of the same gene was detected in german shorthaired pointers affected with an allelic disorder. identification of these canine disorders as homologs of human achm3 underscores the power of recent developments in canine genomics, and provides a valuable system for exploring disease mechanisms and evaluating potential therapeutic measures in disorders of cone photoreceptors.
gallibacterium infection in chickens -a study of taxonomy, epidemiology and bacteria-host interaction the aim of the present study was to compare the potential of bacterial cultivation (bc), pcr, in situ hybridisation (ish), and immunohistochemistry (ihc) in the diagnosis of haemophilus somnus, when applied to pneumonic bovine tissue. lungs from 65 field cases submitted for bacteriological examination were included in the study. the pcr-detection was performed on three different samples: plate-pcr (detection on plate washes after incubation of lung tissue on agar plates); swab-pcr (direct detection on a swab from the cut surface); and, whenever possible, a bronchus-pcr (direct detection on a swab from the main bronchus of the right cranial lung lobe). in order to examine the pathological significance of the findings, a histopathological examination of the cases was performed. h. somnus was detected by one or more techniques in 33 cases in total. by bc the bacterium was isolated from 10 cases, ihc and ish were positive in 17 and 19 cases, and plate- and swab-pcr were positive in 21 and 29 cases, respectively. the bronchus-pcr was positive in 30 out of 61 cases examined. the pcr-technique was the most sensitive method, and as this technique is fast and relatively inexpensive, it should be considered as a supplementary tool in the diagnosis of h. somnus induced calf pneumonia.
crystalline lens power and refractive error. purpose to study the correlation between ocular refraction and the refractive components (corneal power, lens power and axial length) in a population-based sample of normal subjects.   methods we analysed the refractive and biometric findings for 723 right eyes (325 males and 398 females) comprising a population-based random sample of citizens 55 years and older participating in the reykjavik eye study. measurements of refraction, corneal curvature (by keratometry), anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and axial length (all by ultrasound biometry) were used to calculate crystalline lens power. the correlation and regression between refraction and ocular refractive components (corneal power, anterior chamber depth, lens power and axial length) were studied by distributional statistical methods.   results refraction (spherical equivalent) showed a significant negative correlation with axial length (r = -0.59, p < 0.0001), lens power (r = -0.26, p < 0.0001) and corneal power (r = -0.16, p < 0.0001). there were significant negative correlations between axial length and corneal power (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001) and between axial length and lens power (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001). based on multiple linear regression analysis, refraction could be correlated with corneal power, lens power and axial length in combination with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 (p < 0.0001).   conclusion this study confirms that ocular refraction is statistically significantly correlated with not only axial length but also lens power and (to a lesser extent) corneal power. the variation and correlations of crystalline lens power were considerable -- possibly indicating this component's modulatory effect on ocular refraction during growth. we conclude the refractive error of the eye to be a multifactorial condition involving a complex interplay between the cornea, the lens and the length of the eye.
specialized columnar epithelium of the esophagogastric junction: prevalence and associations background—the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and gastric cardia is increasing rapidly. barrett’s oesophagus is the major risk factor. intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction in the absence of barrett’s oesophagus is common but its relation to adenocarcinoma and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is unclear. aims—to study the prevalence and clinical, endoscopic, and histological associations of intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction. methods—biopsy specimens were taken from 120 randomly selected patients undergoing routine diagnostic endoscopy. eight biopsy specimens, taken from above and below the squamocolumnar junction, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum, were stained with haematoxylin/eosin, alcian blue/periodic acid-schiff, and gimenez, and graded independently by one pathologist. results—intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction was found in 21 patients (18%). metaplasia was associated with increasing age (p<0.01) and antral intestinal metaplasia (p=0.04). logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the only independent predictor (p<0.01). there was no association with symptomatic, endoscopic, or histological markers of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. conclusions—intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction is a common finding. it is associated with increasing age but not gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
association of troponin t and altered lipid profile in patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction objectives we sought to evaluate the significance of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) in the context of low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c).   background earlier studies support an inverse correlation between circulating hdl-c and coronary risk in patients with normal or elevated ldl-c.   methods this study involved 4,188 patients attending the palo alto veterans administration medical center or affiliated clinics with ldl-c levels below 60 mg/dl. outcomes were examined 1 year after the index ldl-c date. the combined primary end point was myocardial injury or hospitalization from ischemic heart disease. the secondary end point was all-cause mortality.   results mean hdl-c levels (mg/dl) by quartile (q) were: q1 28 mg/dl, q2 36 mg/dl, q3 43 mg/dl, and q4 63 mg/dl. the rate of myocardial injury or hospitalization for ischemic heart disease showed an inverse relationship to hdl-c (adjusted odds ratios: q1 1.59 [95% confidence interval (ci) 1.16 to 2.19], q2 1.39 [95% ci 1.01 to 1.92], q3 1.33 [95% ci 0.96 to 1.84], and q4 reference) that persisted regardless of statin use or recent myocardial injury. analyzing hdl-c as a continuous variable revealed a 10% [95% ci 3% to 17%] increase in the combined end point of myocardial injury or hospitalization for ischemic heart disease for every 10-mg/dl decrease in hdl-c. the unadjusted and adjusted incidence of all-cause mortality demonstrated a u-shaped relationship to hdl-c (adjusted odds ratios: q1 1.13 [95% ci 0.79 to 1.62], q2 0.97 [95% ci 0.67 to 1.40], q3 0.74 [95% ci 0.50 to 1.09], and q4 reference).   conclusions the inverse relationship between hdl-c and coronary risk persists even among patients with ldl-c below 60 mg/dl, although a u-shaped relationship is observed between hdl-c and all-cause mortality.
reduced hemispheric asymmetry of brain anatomical networks in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a growing body of work utilizing structural and functional brain imaging and neurocognitive measures of executive and attentional function indicates anomalous asymmetry in adhd. this study examined the white-matter volume and diffusion properties of frontostriatal tracts, as a function of hemisphere, in adhd and healthy controls. forty-three young males (21 adhd–combined type and 22 controls) aged 10–18 years underwent structural and diffusion weighted mri. tractography applying constrained spherical deconvolution (csd) was used to construct frontostriatal tracts between each of caudate and putamen and each of dorsolateral prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (dlpfc, vlpfc and ofc) in each hemisphere, to examine both volumetric and diffusion microstructure properties. young people with adhd did not show the right hemisphere lateralization of volume in the caudate-vlpfc and caudate-dlpfc tracts that was evident in controls, however the adhd group displayed a pronounced lateralization to the left for fractional anisotropy in the putamen-vlpfc tracts. the degree of volume asymmetry did not correlate with symptom severity; however fractional anisotropy (fa) values that were more strongly lateralized to the left in the putamen-vlpfc white matter were associated with greater symptom severity. adhd was associated with anomalous hemispheric asymmetries in both tract volume and underlying white-matter microstructure in major fibre tracts of the frontostriatal system. our observations of both weaker lateralization to the right in terms of tract volume and stronger lateralization to the left in terms of fa values for the adhd group, suggests that previous inconsistencies in the literature may reflect the influence of such asymmetries.
predictive value of il-35 and il-17 in diagnosis of childhood asthma abstract objective: allergic asthma is a chronic airway inflammation resulting from an imbalance of t helper (th) cell responses to allergens. interleukin (il)-35 has been shown to have potent immunoregulatory properties. whether il-35 participates in the immunopathogenesis of allergic asthma patients is still unknown. methods: cd4+ t cells and cd4+cd25− t cells were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) using magnetic separation. the concentration of il-35 in plasma was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the mrna expression levels of the il-35 subunits, ebi3 and il-12p35, were detected by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). the proliferative responses of cfse-labeled cd4+cd25− t cells in the presence or absence of rhil-35 were evaluated by flow cytometry. cytokine production of activated cd4+cd25− t cells was examined by flow cytometry and elisa. results: il-35 protein and mrna levels were decreased in allergic asthmatics. the frequencies of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs and cd4+il-12p35+ t cells in allergic asthma patients were lower than in healthy controls. moreover, the addition of rhil-35 suppressed cfse+cd4+cd25− t cell proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, and the suppression induced by rhil-35 was associated with decreases in il-4 but not ifn-γ and il-17 production of activated cd4+cd25− t cells. the increased level of th1/th2 was observed in allergic asthmatics in the presence of rhil-35. conclusions: our data suggest that il-35 can effectively suppress the proliferation and il-4 production of activated cd4+cd25− t cells in allergic asthma, and that il-35 may be a new immunotherapy for asthma patients.
firm dynamics and the importance of the embodied question this paper describes an analytically tractable model of balanced growth that is consistent with the observed size distribution of firms. growth is the result of idiosyncratic firm productivity improvements, selection of successful firms, and imitation by entrants. selection tends to improve aggregate productivity at a fast rate if entry and imitation are easy. the empirical phenomenon of zipf's law can be interpreted to mean that entry costs are high or that imitation is difficult, or both. the small size of entrants indicates that imitation must be difficult. a calibration based on u. s. data suggests that about half of output growth can be attributed to selection. but the implied variance of the combined preference and technology shocks is puzzlingly high.
age differences in visuospatial working memory. in two experiments, we investigated the possibility that susceptibility to proactive interference (pi) affects performance on memory span measures. we tested both younger and older adults (older adults were tested because of the suggestion that they are differentially susceptible to pi). we used two different span measures and manipulated testing procedures to reduce pi for these tasks. for older adults, span estimates increased with each pi-reducing manipulation; for younger adults, scores increased when multiple pi manipulations were combined or when pi-reducing manipulations were used in paradigms in which within-task pi was especially high. the findings suggest that pi critically influences span performance. we consider the possibility that interference-proneness may influence cognitive behaviors previously thought to be governed by capacity.
nicotinamide inhibits alkylating agent-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain nicotinamide (nam) blocks n-methyl-n-nitrosourea (mnu)-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis in rats, though the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. activation of the nuclear enzyme poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) in response to dna damage plays a pivotal role in apoptosis. thus, the role of nam in the regulation of parp and jun n-terminal kinase (jnk)/activator protein-1 (ap-1) was investigated by western blot analyses. during 7 days after the intraperitoneal injection of mnu (60 mg/kg), rat retinas exhibited dna fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis and activation of parp, phosphorylation of jnk and c-jun, induction of ap-1 (c-jun and c-fos) and bax, as well as photoreceptor cell loss. however, when nam (1000 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was given immediately after mnu, it was found that parp activation was diminished, the phosphorylation of jnk and c-jun was suppressed, and the induction of c-jun, c-fos and bax was suppressed. this resulted in the retinal structure being protected. therefore, nam blocked mnu-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis by inhibiting both parp activity and the jnk/ap-1 signalling pathway.
dentists' and dental students' attitudes, knowledge, preparedness, and willingness related to treatment of people living with hiv/aids in china the hiv and aids have emerged as complex health threats to the world population. as future dentists, it is pertinent that the dental students have sufficient knowledge and a positive approach towards the disease. accordingly, the aim of this study was to assess the hiv/aids related knowledge and attitudes amongst clinical dental students at kuwait university. a cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst the clinical dental students using a structured questionnaire with 60 questions to examine their knowledge under various categories and 13 questions to examine their attitudes towards the disease. the survey revealed that almost 58% of the respondents demonstrated a high level of knowledge (mean score: 45.23 ± 4.35 sd). majority of the students (63.6%) expressed negative attitude (mean score: 5.36 ± 2.56 sd). the mean knowledge score of the fifth year dental students was significantly higher (p = 0.022) than that of the final year dental students regarding the knowledge of virus and disease process. however, no significant difference was observed with respect to other knowledge categories. despite their high level of knowledge, the majority displayed a negative attitude towards hiv/aids. hence, the findings imply that there is a need to address, more clearly, the students' misconceptions and attitudes towards the disease.
significance of the 13c-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis the properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. the aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (cbt) using orally administered 13c‐caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. the cbt was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis b or c; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the cbt in a cohort of these subjects. over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the cbt exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, p < .001). cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced cbt values (1.15 ± 0.75 δ‰ mg−1) compared with controls (2.23 ± 0.76; p = .001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 ± 1.05; p = .04). there was a significant inverse relationship between the cbt and child‐pugh score (r = −.74, p = .002). the intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated cbts in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. although smoking was associated with an 86% to 141% increase in cbt in all groups, the cbt was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 ± 0.82, 3.63 ± 1.21, and 2.14 ± 1.14, respectively, p = .001). multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (p < .001) and disease state (p = .001) were significant predictors of the cbt. in conclusion, the 13c‐cbt represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.
photoelastic stress analysis of different designs of cement-retained fixed partial dentures on morse taper oral implants statement of problem to circumvent the difficulty of achieving a passive framework fit, some authors have suggested that multiple adjacent implants be restored individually. this protocol requires that each unit be able to withstand mastication forces. non-splinted restorations have numerous interproximal contacts that require adjustments prior to placement, with an unknown outcome relative to load transfer.   purpose this in vitro simulation study examined the effect of splinting and interproximal contact tightness on passivity of fit and the load transfer characteristics of implant restorations.   material and methods a photoelastic model of a human partially edentulous left mandible with 3 screw-type implants (3.75 x 10 mm) was fabricated. for non-splinted restorations, individual crowns were fabricated on 3 custom-milled titanium abutments. after the units were cemented, 5 levels of interproximal contact tightness were evaluated: open, ideal (8 microm shim stock drags without tearing), light (ideal +10 microm), medium (ideal + 50 microm), and heavy (ideal + 90 microm). for splinted restorations, five 3-unit fixed partial dentures were fabricated, internally adjusted with silicone disclosing material, and cemented to the model. changes in stress distribution under simulated non-loaded and loaded conditions (6.8 kg) were analyzed with a polariscope.   results in the simulated alveolar structures, non-splinted restorations with heavier interproximal contacts were associated with increased tensile stresses between implants; occlusal loads tended to concentrate around the specific loaded implant. splinted restorations shared the occlusal loads and distributed the stresses more evenly between the implants when force was applied. the load-sharing effect was most evident on the center implant but also was seen on the terminal abutments of the splinted restorations.   conclusion the results of this in vitro study suggest that excessive contact tightness between individual crowns can lead to a non-passive situation. in this experiment, splinted restorations exhibited better load sharing than non-splinted restorations.
enhancing the performance of cuckoo search algorithm using orthogonal learning method this paper presents a variant of particle swarm optimizers (psos) that we call the comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (clpso), which uses a novel learning strategy whereby all other particles' historical best information is used to update a particle's velocity. this strategy enables the diversity of the swarm to be preserved to discourage premature convergence. experiments were conducted (using codes available from http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/epnsugan) on multimodal test functions such as rosenbrock, griewank, rastrigin, ackley, and schwefel and composition functions both with and without coordinate rotation. the results demonstrate good performance of the clpso in solving multimodal problems when compared with eight other recent variants of the pso.
differential role of gabaa receptors and neuroligin 2 for perisomatic gabaergic synapse formation in the hippocampus synaptic scaffolding molecule (s‐scam) is a synaptic protein, which harbors five or six psd‐95/discs large/zo‐1 (pdz), a guanylate kinase and two ww domains. it interacts with nmda receptor subunits, neuroligin and β‐catenin, and is involved in the accumulation of neuroligin at excitatory synapses. in this study, we have demonstrated s‐scam is localized at inhibitory synapses in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons. we have identified β‐dystroglycan (β‐dg) as a binding partner for s‐scam at inhibitory synapses. ww domains of s‐scam bind to three sequences of β‐dg. we have also revealed that s‐scam can interact with neuroligin 2, which is known to be exclusively localized at inhibitory synapses. the ww domains and the second pdz domain of s‐scam are involved in the interaction with neuroligin 2. β‐dg, neuroligin 2 and s‐scam form a tripartite complex in vitro. neuroligin 2 is detected in the immunoprecipitates by anti‐β‐dg antibody from rat brain. s‐scam, β‐dg and neuroligin 2 are partially co‐localized in rat hippocampal neurons. these data suggest that s‐scam is associated with β‐dg and neuroligin 2 at inhibitory synapses, and functions as a linker between the dystrophin glycoprotein complex and the neurexin–neuroligin complex.
relationship between body mass index and adiposity in prepubertal children: ethnic and geographic comparisons between new york city and jinan city (china). objectives to test the hypothesis that in a healthy pediatric population body mass index (bmi) (kilograms per meter square) is a valid measure of fatness that is independent of age for both sexes.   methods total body fat (tbf) (in kilograms) and percent of body weight as fat (pbf) were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) in 198 healthy italian children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age. we developed multiple regression analysis models with tbf and percent body fat as dependent variables and bmi, age, and interaction terms as independent variables. separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls.   results bmi was strongly associated with tbf (r2 = 0.85 and 0.89 for boys and girls, respectively) and pbf (r2 =0.63 and 0.69 for boys and girls, respectively). confidence limits on bmi-fatness association were wide, with individuals of similar bmi showing large differences in tbf and in pbf. age was a significant covariate in all regression models. addition of nonlinear terms for bmi did not substantially increase the r2 for tbf and pbf models in boys and girls.   conclusion our results support the use of bmi as a fatness measure in groups of children and adolescents, although interpretation should be cautious when comparing bmi across groups that differ in age or when predicting a specific individual's tbf or pbf.
a time course of hepcidin response to iron challenge in patients with hfe and tfr2 hemochromatosis assays for the detection of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin in plasma or urine have not yet been widely available, whereas quantitative comparisons between hepcidin levels in these different matrices were thus far even impossible due to technical restrictions. to circumvent these limitations, we here describe several advances in time-of flight mass spectrometry (tof ms), the most important of which concerned spiking of a synthetic hepcidin analogue as internal standard into serum and urine samples. this serves both as a control for experimental variation, such as recovery and matrix-dependent ionization and ion suppression, and at the same time allows value assignment to the measured hepcidin peak intensities. the assay improvements were clinically evaluated using samples from various patients groups and its relevance was further underscored by the significant correlation of serum hepcidin levels with serum iron indices in healthy individuals. most importantly, this approach allowed kinetic studies as illustrated by the paired analyses of serum and urine samples, showing that more than 97% of the freely filtered serum hepcidin can be reabsorbed in the kidney. thus, the here reported advances in tof ms-based hepcidin measurements represent critical steps in the accurate quantification of hepcidin in various body fluids and pave the way for clinical studies on the kinetic behavior of hepcidin in both healthy and diseased states.
ocular motor ability and covert attention in patients with duane retraction syndrome shifts of attention can be made overtly by moving the eyes or covertly with attention being allocated to a region of space that does not correspond to the current direction of gaze. however, the precise relationship between eye movements and the covert orienting of attention remains controversial. the influential premotor theory proposes that the covert orienting of attention is produced by the programming of (unexecuted) eye movements and thus predicts a strong relationship between the ability to execute eye movements and the operation of spatial attention. here, we demonstrate for the first time that impaired spatial attention is observed in an individual (ai) who is neurologically healthy but who cannot execute eye movements as a result of a congenital impairment in the elasticity of her eye muscles. this finding provides direct support for the role of the eye-movement system in the covert orienting of attention and suggests that whereas intact cortical structures may be necessary for normal attentional reflexes, they are not sufficient. the ability to move our eyes is essential for the development of normal patterns of spatial attention.
microrna-199a-3p is downregulated in human osteosarcoma and regulates cell proliferation and migration micrornas (mirna) have rapidly emerged as modulators of gene expression in cancer in which they may have great diagnostic and therapeutic import. microrna-199a-3p (mir-199a-3p) is downregulated in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). here, we show that mir-199a-3p targets mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) and c-met in hcc cells. restoring attenuated levels of mir-199a-3p in hcc cells led to g(1)-phase cell cycle arrest, reduced invasive capability, enhanced susceptibility to hypoxia, and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. these in vitro findings were confirmed by an analysis of human hcc tissues, which revealed an inverse correlation linking mir-199a-3p and mtor as well as a shorter time to recurrence after hcc resection in patients with lower mir-199a-3p expression. these results suggest that tactics to regulate mtor and c-met by elevating levels of mir-199a-3p may have therapeutic benefits in highly lethal cancers such as hcc.
ca2+-permeable ampa receptors induce phosphorylation of camp response element-binding protein through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade in neurons through voltage-dependent ion channels activates ras/ mapk. subsequently, four ca1-dependent pathways p21 (ras) is a small guanine nucleotide–binding proto ras have been described; however, the functional tein that functions in signal transduction cascades that independence of the pathways is unclear, since cross– mediate cellular growth and differentiation. ras is highly talk between different pathways probably occurs (figure expressed in the developing and adult nervous systems 1). one ca1-dependent pathway to ras involves the and plays an important role mediating growth factor tyrosine kinase pyk2 (lev et al., 1995). attempts to idenresponses. nearly 2 years ago, it was shown that volttify a function for pyk2 revealed that increases in cytoage-gated ca1 influx can also activate ras. since plasmic ca increased pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation growth factor and ca1 signaling cascades were beand kinase activity. overexpression of pyk2 proportionlieved to be distinct, the mechanisms by which ca ally increases phosphorylation and activation of mapk, activated ras were expected to be novel. until recently, suggesting that pyk2 may activate ras. one answer to these mechanisms have remained a mystery. however, how pyk2 might activate ras comes from analysis of several recent papers provided evidence for no less than a structurally homologous protein, the focal adhesion four ca-dependent pathways that lead to ras. these kinase (p125 or fak). fak is a tyrosine kinase that pathways may play critical roles linking activity-induced mediates signaling by the integrin family of extracellular changes in cytoplasmic ca levels and long-term matrix receptors. one model posits that fak autophochanges in neuronal differentiation, survival, and synapsphorylation and activation results when the cytotic strength. apparent differences in the subcellular loplasmic domains of activated integrin receptors cluster. calization of certain ca-dependent paths to ras sugfak autophosphorylation at tyrosine (y397) enables gest that they may play distinct roles in preand fak to bind avidly the sh2 domain of the tyrosine kinase postsynaptic plasticity mechanisms. the existence of src. the interaction between fak and src may induce multiple pathways could also be important for generata conformational change that activates src. src then ing specific ca21 responses and for integrating the activphosphorylates fak on a specific tyrosine (y925) that ity of ca1-independent signaling pathways. serves as a binding site for grb2. thus, activated fak the ras/mapk cascade may localize the grb2–sos complex to the inner surface four genes comprise the mammalian ras family: ki-ras, of the plasma membrane where it can activate ras. h-ras, n-ras, and r-ras. these genes encode small guasince fak and pyk2 are structurally homologous and nine nucleotide–binding proteins that localize to the inthe fak tyrosine residues y397 and y925 are conserved ner face of the plasma membrane and function as moin pyk2, it seems likely that pyk2 also activates ras lecular switches that transmit receptor signals to by a src-dependent mechanism. support for this model downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) comes from a recent study by halegoua and colleagues cascades (seger and krebs, 1995; herskowitz, 1995). in neuron demonstrating that voltage-dependent ca21 prior to growth factor stimulation or cytosolic ca eleinflux activates src in pc12 cells (rusanescu et al., vations, ras resides at the plasma membrane in an inac1995). tive state, bound to gdp. growth factors, upon binding, halegoua and coworkers showed that ca influx induce their cognate receptors to dimerize and undergo through l-type voltage-dependent channels increases tyrosine autophosphorylation within their cytoplasmic src kinase activity and induces a redistribution of src domains (ng and shooter, 1993). certain tyrosine phosfrom the cytosol to the plasma membrane (rusanescu phorylations create docking sites for proteins that conet al., 1995). they also developed a pc12 subline that tain highly conserved src homology 2 (sh2) domains. stably expressed a dominant-interfering form of src two such sh2-containing proteins are the adapter pro(srcdn). in contrast with the parent pc12 line, srcdn teins known as grb2 and shc. grb2 exists as a complex cells did not undergo depolarization-induced mapk with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (gef) phosphorylation or transcription of the immediate early called son of sevenless (sos). shc can bind the grb2– gene ngfi-a. since factors that regulate ngfi-a transos complex. gefs activate ras by inducing inactive scription are downstream targets of the ras/mapk ras to exchange gdp for gtp. thus, growth factor pathway, these results suggest that ca21 activates the receptors activate ras by bringing the ras–gef, sos, ras/mapk pathway via src. in this study, rusanescu to the membrane through binding grb2 or shc. once et al. also found evidence for shc involvement in src active, ras transmits its signal to the mapk cascade signaling. in pc12 or rasdn cells, ca1 influx triggered
ramipril: a review of its use in the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes. background—in trials of patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure, ace inhibitor use was unexpectedly associated with reduced myocardial infarction (mi). using the heart outcomes prevention evaluation (hope) trial data, we tested prospectively whether ramipril, an ace inhibitor, could reduce coronary events and revascularization procedures among patients with normal left ventricular function. methods and results—in the hope trial, 9297 high-risk men and women, ≥55 years of age with previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes plus 1 risk factor, were randomly assigned to ramipril (up to 10 mg/d), vitamin e (400 iu/d), their combination, or matching placebos. during the mean follow-up of 4.5 years, there were 482 (10.4%) patients with clinical mi and unexpected cardiovascular death in the ramipril group compared with 604 (12.9%) in the placebo group [relative risk reduction (rrr), 21% (95% ci) (11,30);p <0.0003]. ramipril was associated with a trend toward less fatal mi and unexpected death [4.0% versus 4.7%; rrr, 16% (−3, 31)] and with a significant reduction in nonfatal mi [5.6% versus 7.2%; rrr, 23% (9,34)]. risk reductions in mi were documented in participants taking or not taking &bgr;-blockers, lipid lowering, and/or antiplatelet agents. although ramipril had no impact on hospitalizations for unstable angina [11.9% versus 12.2%; rrr, 3% (−9,14)], it reduced the risk of worsening and new angina [27.2% versus 30.0%; rrr, 12% (5,18);p <0.0014] and coronary revascularizations [12.5% versus 14.8%; rrr, 18%; (8,26) p <0.0005]. conclusions—in this high-risk cohort, ramipril reduced the risk of mi, worsening and new angina, and the occurrence of coronary revascularizations.
tissue distribution and function of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (ahrr) in c57bl/6 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor deficient mice the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (ahrr) is a negative regulator of ah receptor (ahr), which mediates most of the toxic and biochemical effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd). ahr has been shown to be the major reason for the exceptionally wide (ca. 1000-fold) sensitivity difference in acute toxicity of tcdd between two rat strains, sensitive long-evans (turku/ab) (l-e) and resistant han/wistar (kuopio) (h/w), but there is another, currently unknown contributing factor involved. in the present study, we examined ahrr structure and expression in these rat strains to find out whether ahrr could be this auxiliary factor. molecular cloning of ahrr coding region showed that consistent with ahrr proteins in other species, the n-terminal end of rat ahrr is highly conserved, but pas b and q-rich domains are severely truncated or lacking. identical structures were recorded in both strains. next, the time-, dose-, and tissue-dependent expression of ahrr was determined using quantitative real-time rt-pcr. in liver, ahrr expression was very low in untreated rats, but it increased rapidly after tcdd exposure (100microg/kg). testis exhibited the highest constitutive expression of ahrr, whereas kidney, spleen, and heart showed the highest induction of ahrr in response to tcdd treatment. again, no marked differences were found between h/w and l-e rats, implying that ahrr is not the auxiliary contributing factor to the strain difference in tcdd sensitivity. however, simultaneous measurement of cyp1a1 mrna reinforced the view that ahrr is an important determinant of tissue-specific responsiveness to tcdd.
effectiveness of cervical cancer screening using visual inspection with acetic acid in peru objective to investigate the value of acetic acid visualization of the cervix as an alternative to cytologic screening. methods a prospective study was conducted in a squatter area in cape town, south africa, on 2426 women who underwent speculum examination, naked-eye inspection of the cervix after application of acetic acid, and cytologic smear. the smears were stained and processed at the screening site. patients with a positive reading after acetic acid or a smear indicating a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (sil) were referred for immediate colposcopy, biopsy, and when indicated, treatment by large loop excision of the transformation zone. therefore, histology was obtained on all patients with a positive acetic acid test or a positive cytology. results seventy-six women with positive reactions to acetic acid. among the 2350 women with negative reactions, 254 had positive cervical smears; only 11 of these had histologic high-grade sil. in contrast, 20 of the 61 women with positive cytology and positive acetic acid test had high-grade sil on histology. therefore, the acetic acid reaction enabled the observer to detect 20 of the 31 women (64%) who exhibited a high-grade sil both on cytology and histology. conclusion in locations where access to cytopathology is limited, naked-eye visualization of the cervix after application of diluted acetic acid warrants consideration as an alternative in the detection of cervical premalignant lesions.
conserved and muscle-group-specific gene expression patterns shape postnatal development of the novel extraocular muscle phenotype. abstract the genetic and epigenetic influences that establish and maintain the unique phenotype of the extraocular muscles (eoms) are poorly understood. the vestibulo-ocular reflex (vor) represents an important input into the eoms, as it stabilizes eye position relative to the environment and provides a platform for function of all other eye movement systems. a role for vestibular cues in shaping eom maturation was assessed in these studies using the ototoxic nitrile compound 3’,3’-iminodipropionitrile (idpn) to eliminate the receptor hair cells that drive the vestibulo-ocular reflex. intraperitoneal injections of idpn were followed by a 2-week survival period, after which myosin heavy chain (myhc) analysis of the eoms was performed. when idpn was administered to juvenile rats, the proportion of eye muscle fibers expressing developmental and fast myosins was increased, while eom-specific myhc mrna levels were downregulated. by contrast, idpn treatment in adult rats affected only the proportion of fibers expressing developmental myhc isoforms, leaving the eom-specific myhc mrna unaltered. these data provide evidence that the vor modulates eom-specific myhc expression in development. the lack of significant changes in eom-specific myhc expression in adult eom following idpn administration suggests that there may be a critical period during development when alterations in vestibular activity have significant and permanent consequences for the eye muscles.
a phase i dose-escalation study of the vegfr inhibitor tivozanib hydrochloride with weekly paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer purpose: to assess the maximum tolerated dose (mtd)/dose-limiting toxicities (dlt), safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of tivozanib, a potent and selective oral vegf receptor (vegfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. experimental design: dose levels of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/d tivozanib for 28 days followed by 14 days of medication were explored in patients with advanced solid tumors. results: forty-one patients were enrolled. animal data incorrectly predicted toxicity, resulting in dlts at the starting dose (2.0 mg) consisting of grade 3 proteinuria and hypertension and grade 3 ataxia. at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. at an intermediate dose (1.5 mg), 1 patient experienced dlt consisting of grade 3 hypertension. this dose was determined as the mtd. of 10 additional patients treated at 1.5 mg, 1 patient each experienced grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 fatigue, and 2 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevation. in 12 additional patients treated at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. pharmacokinetics displayed long absorption time, dose proportional exposure, and a half-life of 4.7 days. plasma levels of vegf-a and soluble vegfr-2 showed dose-dependent increases and decreases, respectively. dynamic contrast-enhanced mri indicated reduction in tumor perfusion. clinical activity was observed in renal cell cancer, colorectal cancer, and other tumors. conclusion: tivozanib was well tolerated with manageable side effects. the pharmacokinetics profile revealed that tivozanib was suitable for once-daily dosing. encouraging and durable clinical activity was observed. the recommended daily dose of tivozanib in a 4-week-on and 2-week-off dosing regimen is 1.5 mg. clin cancer res; 17(22); 7156–63. ©2011 aacr.
rapid eye movement (rem) rebound on initial exposure to cpap therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis remmers, j. e., w. j. degroot, e. k. sauerland, and a. m. anch. pathogenesis of upper airww occlusion during . sleep. j. appl. physiol.: respirat. environ. exercise physiol. 44ftik 931-938, 1978. -ten patients with daytime somnolence and obesity were found to have periodic airway occlusion (ao) during nocturnal sleep. the cyclical ventilatory pattern consisted of a series of regular inspiratory efforts against an occluded airway (occlusive phase) alternating with a period of regular breathing (ventilatory phase). significant periods of central respiratory apnea were observed only in one case. the effects of pharyngeal intubation and pharyngeal pressure recordings showed that the locus of airway closure lay in the oropharynx. the genioglossal electromyogram (emg) consistently revealed periodicity: low level activity at the onset of occlusion and prominent discharge at the instant of pharyngeal opening. in one case, this activity was closely related to pharyngeal patency, whereas in other cases there was considerable overlap between emg values recorded during occluded and ventilatory phases. in these cases, the relationship of genioglossal discharge to pharyngeal pressure correlated with the presence or absence of pharyngeal occlusion. we speculate that genioglossal force act,s to open the oropharynx and that negative pharyngeal pressure promotes pharyngeal closure. the results are consistent with the idea that, once the pharvnx has collapsed, relative recruitment of genioglossal and inspiratory muscle act.ivity is such that the latter influence outstrips the former, so that pharyngeal transmural pressure increases more than genioglossal force. pharyngeal opening occurs coincident with arousal and preferential activation of the genioglossus muscle of the tongue.
further experience with distal aortic perfusion and motor-evoked potential monitoring in the management of extent i-iii thoracoabdominal aortic anuerysms. objective to report the long-term results of our experience using cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion in descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair. summary background data repair of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm by the traditional clamp-and-go technique results in a massive ischemic insult to several major organ systems. ten years ago, we began to use distal aortic perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid drainage (adjunct) to reduce end-organ ischemia. methods between january 1991 and february 2003, we performed 1004 thoracoabdominal or descending thoracic repairs. adjunct was used in 741 (74%) of 1004. multivariable data were analyzed by cox regression. number needed to treat was calculated as the reciprocal of the risk difference. results immediate neurologic deficit was 18 (2.4%) of 741 with adjunct and 18 (6.8%) of 263 without (p < 0.0009). in high-risk extent ii aneurysms, the numbers were 11 (6.6%) of 167 with adjunct, and 11 (29%) of 38 without. long-term survival was improved with adjunct (p < 0.002). the long-term survival results persisted after adjustment for age, extent ii aneurysm, and preoperative renal function. conclusion use of adjunct over a long period of time has produced favorable results; approximately 1 neurologic deficit saved for every 20 uses of adjunct overall. in extent ii aneurysms, where the effect is greatest, this increases to 1 saved per 5 uses. adjunct is also associated with long-term survival, which is consistent with mitigation of ischemic end-organ injury. these long-term results indicate that cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion are safe and effective adjunct for reducing morbidity and mortality following thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair.
partially erupted third molars as a potential source of infection in patients receiving peripheral stem cell transplantation for malignant diseases: a retrospective study. viridans streptococci were the most common cause of bacteremia in 61 consecutive myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients, occurring in 19 of 31 bacteremic patients (61%) during the period of post-transplant neutropenia. seven of the 19 had more than one viridans streptococcus in the same blood culture. twenty isolates from 15 patients were streptococcus mitis. most viridans streptococci were resistant to norfloxacin, used routinely for prophylaxis. comparison of the 19 patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia with a contemporaneous group of 23 allogeneic hsct recipients with fever and neutropenia but no identified focus of infection found that patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia were more likely to have severe intraoral pathology while neutropenic (26% vs 0%) and slightly shorter interval between the last dental procedure and the onset of neutropenia (11 vs 14 days). poor underlying dental health and the use of norfloxacin thus appear to predispose to viridans streptococcal bacteremia. bone marrow transplantation (2001) 27, 537–542.
removal of intra-abdominal mislocated intrauterine devices by laparoscopy objective this prospective study aimed to evaluate an alternative laparoscopic extracorporeal approach for the treatment of benign ovarian cysts.   materials and methods the initial study population included 243 patients diagnosed with benign ovarian masses. two patients with suspected malignancies and 21 patients with technical difficulties secondary to severe, dense pelvic adhesions were excluded from the study, and the final study population, therefore, comprised 220 patients. a primary 10-mm trocar was inserted, followed by a second incision on the side of the cyst and the introduction of an ancillary 5-mm trocar. the cystic content was aspirated using a needle. the capsule was held using an endograsper inserted through the ancillary trocar. the capsule was extracted from the abdomen. the 5-mm trocar and the endograsper were removed from the abdomen simultaneously. the capsule was completely detached. homeostasis was performed and the ovary was then released.   results the mean duration of the operation was 20 +/- 5 minutes. the size of the cysts ranged from 5 cm to 15 cm (mean, 8.4 +/- 2.6 cm). the pathologies of the cysts were simple cyst in 86 cases, endometrioma in 68, serous cyst in 57, mucinous cyst in eight and borderline in one. the perioperative complication rate was 2.27%.   conclusion this technique does not require the use of two or more ancillary trocars or widening of the trocar incision. the duration of surgery can be shortened considerably and complete excision of the cystic capsule can be performed. homeostasis was achieved using 3-0 polyglactin sutures. no electrocoagulation was required.
intravitreal anti-vegf treatment for choroidal neovascularization secondary to punctate inner choroidopathy purpose to assess the role of bevacizumab in inflammatory ocular neovascularization.   design retrospective, multicenter, consecutive case series of inflammatory ocular neovascularization.   methods patients with inflammatory ocular neovascularization of varying causes for whom standard therapy failed were treated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. main outcome measures included improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (bcva) expressed in logarithm of minimum angle of resolution units, response of inflammatory ocular neovascularization by funduscopy and angiography, and decrease in central foveal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography at the three-month follow-up.   results at the three-month follow-up, 84 eyes of 79 patients had been treated with a mean of 1.3 injections (range, one to three). thirty-four eyes showed juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization (cnv), 34 eyes showed subfoveal cnv, eight eyes showed peripapillary cnv, and 11 eyes showed neovascularization of the disc (nvd) or neovascularization elsewhere (nve). bcva improved 2.4 lines from 0.68 (6/28 or 20/94) to 0.44 (6/17 or 20/55) (p < .001). bcva improved by one to three lines in 34.5% of the eyes, by four to six lines in 16.7% of the eyes, and by more than six lines in 14.2% of the eyes. function was unchanged in 23.8% of the eyes. bcva worsened in 10.7% (zero to three lines in 7.1%, more than four lines in 3.6%). central foveal thickness decreased from baseline 346 to 252 microm (p < .001). for cnv, 32 eyes (43.2%) had complete regression after the injection, 27 (36.5%) had partial regression, five (6.8%) had no response, and 10 eyes (13.5%) were not evaluated by the contributors. for nvd or nve, seven eyes (63.6%) had complete regression of new vessels and four eyes (36.4%) had partial regression after the injection.   conclusions intravitreal bevacizumab led to short-term significant visual improvement and regression of inflammatory ocular neovascularization in a wide variety of inflammatory ocular diseases.
inhibition of tnf-alpha production contributes to the attenuation of lps-induced hypophagia by pentoxifylline. the present study was designed to test whether a tolerance to the hypophagic effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and muramyl dipeptide (mdp) develops with repeated injections in rats and whether a relationship between the hypophagic effects of both compounds exists. only the first of three subsequent intraperitoneal injection of lps (100 micrograms/kg body wt each), given every 2nd day, led to a significant reduction of food intake. in contrast, mdp (1.6 mg/kg body wt) did not lose its hypophagic effect with four subsequent intraperitoneal injections. furthermore, the lps tolerance did not alter the hypophagic response to subsequently injected mdp. likewise, mdp pretreatment did not alter the hypophagic response to lps. doses of mdp and lps that were individually below the threshold for a reliable reduction of food intake (0.4 mg mdp/kg body wt + 25 micrograms lps/kg body wt) reduced food intake synergistically when injected together. the hypophagia produced by combined injections of mdp plus lps slowly diminished with repeated injections. the results indicate that separate but interacting mechanisms are involved in the feeding responses to mdp and lps. the observed synergism between mdp and lps suggests a synergistic role of bacterial muramyl peptides and lps in the anorexia during bacterial infections.
binding of [123i]iodobenzamide to the rat d2 receptor after challenge with various doses of methylphenidate: an in vivo imaging study with dedicated small animal spect purposethe dopamine d2 receptor (d2r) is important in the mediation of addiction. [123i]iodobenzamide (ibzm), a spect ligand for the d2r, has been used for in vivo studies of d2r availability in humans, monkeys, and rats. although mouse models are important in the study of addiction, [123i]ibzm has not been used in mice spect studies. this study evaluates the use of [123i]ibzm for measuring d2r availability in mice.methodspharmacokinetics of [123i]ibzm in mice were studied with pinhole spect imaging after intravenous (i.v.) injection of [123i]ibzm (20, 40, and 70 mbq). in addition, the ability to measure the release of endogenous dopamine after amphetamine administration with [123i]ibzm spect was investigated. thirdly, i.v. administration, the standard route of administration, and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of [123i]ibzm were compared.resultsspecific binding of [123i]ibzm within the mouse striatum could be clearly visualized with spect. peak specific striatal binding ratios were reached around 90 min post-injection. after amphetamine administration, the specific binding ratios of [123i]ibzm decreased significantly (−27.2%; n = 6; p = 0.046). intravenous administration of [123i]ibzm led to significantly higher specific binding than i.p. administration of the same dose. however, we found that i.v. administration of a dose of 70 mbq [123i]ibzm might result in acute ethanol intoxication because ethanol is used as a preparative aid for the routine production of [123i]ibzm.conclusionsimaging of d2r availability and endogenous dopamine release in mice is feasible using [123i]ibzm single pinhole spect. using commercially produced [123i]ibzm, a dose of 40 mbq injected i.v. can be recommended.
hepatitis a virus capsid protein vp1 has a heterogeneous c terminus portions of the p1 and p2 hepatitis a virus (hav) polyprotein were generated by in vitro translation of cdna transcripts and analyzed for a primary cleavage reaction that would release the capsid protein precursor. no autocatalytic activity was observed on either side of the 2a coding sequence. incubation of these proteins with an extract containing active hav 3c protease, however, resulted in cleavage at a position approximately 40 amino acids downstream of the previously proposed p1-2a junction. this cleavage site likely accounts for the vp1-containing proteins of approximately 38-40 kda observed in hav-infected cells.
a supramodal neural network for speech and gesture semantics: an fmri study symbolic gestures, such as pantomimes that signify actions (e.g., threading a needle) or emblems that facilitate social transactions (e.g., finger to lips indicating “be quiet”), play an important role in human communication. they are autonomous, can fully take the place of words, and function as complete utterances in their own right. the relationship between these gestures and spoken language remains unclear. we used functional mri to investigate whether these two forms of communication are processed by the same system in the human brain. responses to symbolic gestures, to their spoken glosses (expressing the gestures' meaning in english), and to visually and acoustically matched control stimuli were compared in a randomized block design. general linear models (glm) contrasts identified shared and unique activations and functional connectivity analyses delineated regional interactions associated with each condition. results support a model in which bilateral modality-specific areas in superior and inferior temporal cortices extract salient features from vocal-auditory and gestural-visual stimuli respectively. however, both classes of stimuli activate a common, left-lateralized network of inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions in which symbolic gestures and spoken words may be mapped onto common, corresponding conceptual representations. we suggest that these anterior and posterior perisylvian areas, identified since the mid-19th century as the core of the brain's language system, are not in fact committed to language processing, but may function as a modality-independent semiotic system that plays a broader role in human communication, linking meaning with symbols whether these are words, gestures, images, sounds, or objects.
effectiveness of cervical cancer screening using visual inspection with acetic acid in peru objective to investigate the value of acetic acid visualization of the cervix as an alternative to cytologic screening. methods a prospective study was conducted in a squatter area in cape town, south africa, on 2426 women who underwent speculum examination, naked-eye inspection of the cervix after application of acetic acid, and cytologic smear. the smears were stained and processed at the screening site. patients with a positive reading after acetic acid or a smear indicating a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (sil) were referred for immediate colposcopy, biopsy, and when indicated, treatment by large loop excision of the transformation zone. therefore, histology was obtained on all patients with a positive acetic acid test or a positive cytology. results seventy-six women with positive reactions to acetic acid. among the 2350 women with negative reactions, 254 had positive cervical smears; only 11 of these had histologic high-grade sil. in contrast, 20 of the 61 women with positive cytology and positive acetic acid test had high-grade sil on histology. therefore, the acetic acid reaction enabled the observer to detect 20 of the 31 women (64%) who exhibited a high-grade sil both on cytology and histology. conclusion in locations where access to cytopathology is limited, naked-eye visualization of the cervix after application of diluted acetic acid warrants consideration as an alternative in the detection of cervical premalignant lesions.
transcriptome adaptation of the bovine mammary gland to diets rich in unsaturated fatty acids shows greater impact of linseed oil over safflower oil on gene expression and metabolic pathways backgroundbovine milk fat composition is responsive to dietary manipulation providing an avenue to modify the content of fatty acids and especially some specific unsaturated fatty acid (usfa) isomers of benefit to human health. micrornas (mirnas) regulate gene expression but their specific roles in bovine mammary gland lipogenesis are unclear. the objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of mirnas following mammary gland adaptation to dietary supplementation with 5 % linseed or safflower oil using next generation rna-sequencing.methodstwenty-four canadian holstein dairy cows (twelve per treatment) in mid lactation were fed a control diet (total mixed ration of corn:grass silages) for 28 days followed by a treatment period (control diet supplemented with 5 % linseed or safflower oil) of 28 days. milk samples were collected weekly for fat and individual fatty acid determination. rna from mammary gland biopsies harvested on day-14 (control period) and on days +7 and +28 (treatment period) from six randomly selected cows per treatment was subjected to small rna sequencing.resultsmilk fat percentage decreased significantly (p < 0.001) during treatment with the two diets as compared to the control period. the individual saturated fatty acids c4:0, c6:0, c8:0, c14:0 and c16:0 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) while five usfas (c14:1, c18:1n11t, c20:3n3, c20:5n3 and cla:t10c12) increased remarkably (p < 0.05) in response to both treatments. analysis of 361 million sequence reads generated 321 known bovine mirnas and 176 novel mirnas. the expression of fourteen and twenty-two mirnas was affected (p < 0.05) by linseed and safflower oil treatments, respectively. seven mirnas including six up-regulated (bta-mir-199c, mir-199a-3p, mir-98, mir-378, mir-148b and mir-21-5p) and one down-regulated (bta-mir-200a) were found to be regulated (p < 0.05) by both treatments, and thus considered core differentially expressed (de) mirnas. the gene targets of core de mirnas have functions related to gene expression and general cellular metabolism (p < 0.05) and are enriched in four pathways of lipid metabolism (3-phosphoinositide biosynthesis, 3-phosphoinositide degradation, d-myo-inisitol-5-phosphate metabolism and the superpathway of inositol phosphate compounds).conclusionour results suggest that de mirnas in this study might be important regulators of bovine mammary lipogenesis and metabolism. the novel mirnas identified in this study will further enrich the bovine mirnome repertoire and contribute to understanding mammary gland biology.
the effect of exercise intensity on endothelial function in physically inactive lean and obese adults objective: to ascertain in obesity the role of body fat distribution (the strongest predictor of morbility and mortality in obese subjects) in determining the degree of endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of atherosclerotic disease.subjects: 18 premenopausal women with uncomplicated obesity excluding other cardiovascular risk factors and 12 age-matched slim healthy women.measurements: endothelium-dependent vasodilation, studied as diameter variation in response to an increase in shear-stress, was evaluated in the right common femoral artery of obese and slim subjects by a non invasive approach and compared to glyceril-trinitrate vasodilation. to characterize better the vascular functional and/or structural properties, we studied the arterial wall distensibility by an echo-tracking system. adipose tissue regional distribution was determined by computerised axial tomography.results: the endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly impaired in obese subjects (p<0.005 versus non-obese subjects) while glyceril-trinitrate vasodilation and arterial distensibility were similar in the two groups. in our obese subjects endothelial-dependent vasodilation was inversely correlated to body fat distribution (visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio: r=− 0.624, p=0.0058). in contrast, metabolic parameters (except c-peptide response during oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): r=−0.587, p=0.01), blood pressure values and body weight did not correlate with the endothelial function.conclusion: uncomplicated obesity per se is characterised by an alteration of the endothelial function; the degree of this vascular damage is predicted by body fat distribution independently of body weight and metabolic and other haemodynamic parameters, and correlates with an index of insulin secretion.
decline in hiv prevalence among young women in zambia: national-level estimates of trends mask geographical and socio-demographic differences backgroundthe premise for using antenatal care (anc) clinic data for estimating hiv prevalence in the general population is the finding from community studies in sub-saharan africa that total hiv prevalence in pregnant women attending anc clinics closely approximate levels in the total general population of both women and men aged 15–49 years. in this study, the validity of national level hiv prevalence estimates for the total general population 15–49 years made from anc clinic and population survey data was assessed.methodsin 2001–2002, a national population hiv prevalence survey for women 15–49 years and men 15–59 years was conducted in zambia. in the same period, a national hiv sentinel surveillance survey among pregnant women attending anc clinics was carried out.resultsthe anc hiv prevalence estimates for age-group 15–49 years (rural: 11.5%; 95% ci, 11.2–11.8; urban: 25.4%; 95% ci, 24.8–26.0; adjusted national: 16.9%; 95% ci, 16.6–17.2) were similar to the population survey estimates (rural: 10.8%; 95% ci, 9.6–12.1; urban: 23.2%; 95% ci 20.7–25.6; national: 15.6%; 95% ci, 14.4–16.9). the hiv prevalence urban to rural ratio was 2.2 in anc and 2.1 in population survey estimates.conclusionthe hiv prevalence estimate for the total general population 15–49 years derived from testing both women and men in the population survey was similar to the estimate derived from testing women attending anc clinics. it shows that national hiv prevalence estimates for adults aged 15–49 years can also be obtained from anc hiv sentinel surveillance surveys with good coverage when anc attendance and fertility are high.
ribosome assembly factors pwp1 and nop12 are important for folding of 5.8s rrna during ribosome biogenesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome biogenesis is a complex multistep process that involves alternating steps of folding and processing of pre-rrnas in concert with assembly of ribosomal proteins. recently, there has been increased interest in the roles of ribosomal proteins in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis in vivo, focusing primarily on their function in pre-rrna processing. however, much less is known about participation of ribosomal proteins in the formation and rearrangement of preribosomal particles as they mature to functional subunits. we have studied ribosomal proteins l7 and l8, which are required for the same early steps in pre-rrna processing during assembly of 60s subunits but are located in different domains within ribosomes. depletion of either leads to defects in processing of 27sa(3) to 27sb pre-rrna and turnover of pre-rrnas destined for large ribosomal subunits. a specific subset of proteins is diminished from these residual assembly intermediates: six assembly factors required for processing of 27sa(3) pre-rrna and four ribosomal proteins bound to domain i of 25s and 5.8s rrnas surrounding the polypeptide exit tunnel. in addition, specific sets of ribosomal proteins are affected in each mutant: in the absence of l7, proteins bound to domain ii, l6, l14, l20, and l33 are greatly diminished, while proteins l13, l15, and l36 that bind to domain i are affected in the absence of l8. thus, l7 and l8 might establish rnp structures within assembling ribosomes necessary for the stable association and function of the a(3) assembly factors and for proper assembly of the neighborhoods containing domains i and ii.
evaluating the synergistic neutralizing effect of anti-botulinum oligoclonal antibody preparations we have previously demonstrated how to transform the conventional method of hybridoma production and screening into a fast, high‐throughput technology. nevertheless, there were still open questions related to automated procedures and immunization protocols that we address now by comparing the hybridoma production work‐flow in automated and manually executed processes. in addition, since the animals' antibody responses to single or multiple antigen challenge affect monoclonal antibody throughput, different immunization and fusion strategies were tested. specifically, the results obtained with multiplexing (multiple target antigens injected into a single animal) and single antigen immunization followed by splenocyte pooling immediately before fusion were compared with conventional methods. the results presented here demonstrate that the optimal protocol consists of automated somatic‐cell fusion and hybridoma dilution followed by manual plating of hybridoma cells. additionally, more specific and productive hybridoma clones were obtained with multiplexed immunization in a single animal with respect to the splenocyte pooling from single antigen immunized animals. however, in terms of overall antibody yield, the conventional method consisting of single immunization for each single animal assured ten times more specific hybridoma cell lines than the strategy based on the multiple antigen immunization followed by separate fusion step. in conclusion, the most productive approach for recovering a large number of suitable antibodies relies on single antigen immunization followed by automated fusion and dilution steps and manual plating. © 2011 american institute of chemical engineers biotechnol. prog., 2011
decrease in serum interleukin-21 levels is associated with disease activity improvement in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis. objective. to investigate the levels of the t helper (th)17-related cytokines interleukin 17a (il-17a), il-21, and il-23 and their association with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods. in a longitudinal sample set from patients with early ra (< 6 months; n = 40), we measured the plasma cytokine levels of il-17a, il-21, and il-23 and analyzed for correlation with disease activity in 28 joints (disease activity score 28-joint count; das28), c-reactive protein (crp), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), and total sharp score (tss). in a transverse sample set of patients with chronic ra (> 8 years), using paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells, we investigated the cellular expression of il-17a, il-21, and il-23r. results. patients with early-stage ra had significantly increased plasma levels of il-21 and il-23, but not il-17a, compared to patients with chronic ra and healthy volunteer controls. plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 after 12 months of treatment correlated with das28 and esr, but not to tss. changes in il-23 plasma levels from time of diagnosis to 12 months correlated with change in das28 and with tss scores at 2 years. the numbers of cd4+ t cells producing il-21 were significantly increased in the synovial fluid of patients with chronic ra, with only marginal coexpression of il-21 and il-17a. conclusion. our results show a significant association between plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 and disease activity in ra, supporting the hypothesis that il-21 and il-23 are important pathogenic factors of this disease.
dormant origins licensed by excess mcm2-7 are required for human cells to survive replicative stress. the inhibition of dna synthesis in normal human cells by uv is a complex function of fluence because it has several causes. at low fluences, inhibition of replicon initiation is most important. this is made clear by the fact that it occurs to a lesser degree in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (at). assuming that only leading strand synthesis is blocked by uv-induced lesions, single lesions between replicons in parental strands for leading strand synthesis inhibit dna synthesis by acting as temporary blocks until they are replicated by extension of the lagging strand of the adjacent replicon. a more severe inhibition occurs when two lesions are induced between adjacent growing replicons, because one in four possible configurations may result in a long-lived unreplicated region (llur). in the absence of excision repair, these may eventually be replicated by activation of an otherwise unused origin within the llur. the frequency of llurs increases steeply with fluence. activation of normally unused origins to replicate llurs may facilitate recovery from inhibition of dna synthesis, but repair of lesions is probably more important. in excision-repair-defective cells, an llur without an origin to initiate its replication may be a lethal lesion.
surgical responses of medial rectus muscle recession in thyroid eye disease-related esotropia purpose to evaluate the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of medial rectus (mr) recessions in patients with graves' ophthalmopathy.   patients and methods the clinical records of 32 patients with graves' ophthalmopathy who underwent mr recessions with adjustable sutures for restrictive esotropia were reviewed. the clinical characteristics of patients, the size of the esodeviations, the limitations of ductions, the surgical doses, and observed responses to surgery were recorded and analyzed. main outcome measures included the ratio of predicted to observed correction for mr recessions, improvement in ductions, and restoration of binocular status.   results the mean age of the 32 patients (20 women, 12 men) at surgery was 54.1+/-11.4 years. the mean duration of thyroid eye disease was 4.3+/-5.4 years (range, 1 to 24 years). the ratios of predicted to observed correction for esodeviations at distance and near, respectively, were 2.21+/-1.24 and 2.16+/-1.81 at the time of adjustment and 1.61+/-0.37 and 1.84+/-0.90 at final follow-up. the limitation of abduction improved from -2.3+/-1.3 to -0.75 +/-0.98. binocular single vision was achieved in 73% of patients, and a further 10% of patients were able to fuse with prisms. a history of decompression was present in 75% of cases. patients with a history of decompression had more restriction in abduction (-2.49 vs -1.78, p =.061), more frequently required bilateral surgery (75% vs 62.5%), and had a higher ratio of predicted to observed correction (1.71 -0.37 vs 1.37+/-0.28, p = .043).   conclusions patients with graves' ophthalmopathy who undergo mr recession for restrictive esotropia are prone to undercorrection. a history of decompression is associated with a less favorable clinical outcome. augmented surgery, adjustable sutures, or both are recommended for improved surgical outcomes.
parasynaptic nmda receptor signaling couples neuronal glutamate transporter function to ampa receptor synaptic distribution and stability the predominant neuronal glutamate transporter, eaac1 (for excitatory amino acid carrier-1), is localized to the dendrites and somata of many neurons. rare presynaptic localization is restricted to gaba terminals. because glutamate is a precursor for gaba synthesis, we hypothesized that eaac1 may play a role in regulating gaba synthesis and, thus, could cause epilepsy in rats when inactivated. reduced expression of eaac1 by antisense treatment led to behavioral abnormalities, including staring–freezing episodes and electrographic (eeg) seizures. extracellular hippocampal and thalamocortical slice recordings showed excessive excitability in antisense-treated rats. patch-clamp recordings of miniature ipscs (mipscs) conducted in ca1 pyramidal neurons in slices from eaac1 antisense-treated animals demonstrated a significant decrease in mipsc amplitude, indicating decreased tonic inhibition. there was a 50% loss of hippocampal gaba levels associated with knockdown of eaac1, and newly synthesized gaba from extracellular glutamate was significantly impaired by reduction of eaac1 expression. eaac1 may participate in normal gaba neurosynthesis and limbic hyperexcitability, whereas epilepsy can result from a disruption of the interaction between eaac1 and gaba metabolism.
molecular and structural characterization of barley vernalization genes winter wheats require several weeks at low temperature to flower. this process, vernalization, is controlled mainly by the vrn1 gene. using 6,190 gametes, we found vrn1 to be completely linked to mads-box genes ap1 and aglg1 in a 0.03-centimorgan interval flanked by genes cysteine and cytochrome b5. no additional genes were found between the last two genes in the 324-kb triticum monococcum sequence or in the colinear regions in rice and sorghum. wheat ap1 and aglg1 genes were similar to arabidopsis meristem identity genes ap1 and agl2, respectively. ap1 transcription was regulated by vernalization in both apices and leaves, and the progressive increase of ap1 transcription was consistent with the progressive effect of vernalization on flowering time. vernalization was required for ap1 transcription in apices and leaves in winter wheat but not in spring wheat. aglg1 transcripts were detected during spike differentiation but not in vernalized apices or leaves, suggesting that ap1 acts upstream of aglg1. no differences were detected between genotypes with different vrn1 alleles in the ap1 and aglg1 coding regions, but three independent deletions were found in the promoter region of ap1. these results suggest that ap1 is a better candidate for vrn1 than aglg1. the epistatic interactions between vernalization genes vrn1 and vrn2 suggested a model in which vrn2 would repress directly or indirectly the expression of ap1. a mutation in the promoter region of ap1 would result in the lack of recognition of the repressor and in a dominant spring growth habit.
rapid long-range disynaptic inhibition explains the formation of cortical orientation maps competition is a well-studied and powerful mechanism for information processing in neuronal networks, providing noise rejection, signal restoration, decision making and associative memory properties, with relatively simple requirements for network architecture. models based on competitive interactions have been used to describe the shaping of functional properties in visual cortex, as well as the development of functional maps in columnar cortex. these models require competition within a cortical area to occur on a wider spatial scale than cooperation, usually implemented by lateral inhibitory connections having a longer range than local excitatory connections. however, measurements of cortical anatomy reveal that the spatial extent of inhibition is in fact more restricted than that of excitation. relatively few models reflect this, and it is unknown whether lateral competition can occur in cortical-like networks that have a realistic spatial relationship between excitation and inhibition. here we analyze simple models for cortical columns and perform simulations of larger models to show how the spatial scales of excitation and inhibition can interact to produce competition through disynaptic inhibition. our findings give strong support to the direct coupling effect—that the presence of competition across the cortical surface is predicted well by the anatomy of direct excitatory and inhibitory coupling and that multisynaptic network effects are negligible. this implies that for networks with short-range inhibition and longer-range excitation, the spatial extent of competition is even narrower than the range of inhibitory connections. our results suggest the presence of network mechanisms that focus on intra-rather than intercolumn competition in neocortex, highlighting the need for both new models and direct experimental characterizations of lateral inhibition and competition in columnar cortex.
the role of the myosin atpase activity in adaptive thermogenesis by skeletal muscle purpose of reviewto discuss the potential importance of spontaneous physical activity in regulating body weight and outline possible reasons for the large interindividual variance in spontaneous physical activity. recent findingsspontaneous physical activity is highly variable among people, with some having high levels and some low, and can contribute significantly to interindividual differences in total daily energy expenditure. cross-sectionally, spontaneous physical activity is inversely related to body weight; however, more importantly, spontaneous physical activity is inversely associated with weight gain in prospective studies, and experimental weight perturbations do not appear to change spontaneous physical activity behavior. spontaneous physical activity is a familial trait and is biologically influenced, although the environment exerts a significant impact. summaryalthough spontaneous physical activity is a biologically driven behavior, interventions to increase nonexercise activity within the workplace and school hold promise in increasing daily energy expenditure for the average sedentary american. however, many large-scale efforts will need to take place within our sedentary-promoting environment to encourage more daily spontaneous physical activity-related activity.
interpersonal effects of expressed anger and sorrow in morally charged negotiation three experiments investigated the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness in negotiations. in the course of a computer-mediated negotiation, participants received information about the emotional state (anger, happiness, or none) of their opponent. consistent with a strategic-choice perspective, experiment 1 showed that participants conceded more to an angry opponent than to a happy one. experiment 2 showed that this effect was caused by tracking--participants used the emotion information to infer the other's limit, and they adjusted their demands accordingly. however, this effect was absent when the other made large concessions. experiment 3 examined the interplay between experienced and communicated emotion and showed that angry communications (unlike happy ones) induced fear and thereby mitigated the effect of the opponent's experienced emotion. these results suggest that negotiators are especially influenced by their opponent's emotions when they are motivated and able to consider them.
interactive effects of dietary lipids and vitamin e level on performance, blood eicosanoids, and response to mitogen stimulation in broiler chickens of different ages consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids greatly exceeds that of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic gives rise to the eicosanoid family of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes and related metabolites) and through these regulates the activities of inflammatory cells, the production of cytokines and the various balances within the immune system. fish oil and oily fish are good sources of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. consumption of these fatty acids decreases the amount of arachidonic acid in cell membranes and so available for eicosanoid production. thus, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids act as arachidonic acid antagonists. components of both natural and acquired immunity, including the production of key inflammatory cytokines, can be affected by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. although some of the effects of n-3 fatty acids may be brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, it is possible that these fatty acids might elicit some of their effects by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms. such n-3 fatty acid-induced effects may be of use as a therapy for acute and chronic inflammation, and for disorders which involve an inappropriately activated immune response.
same-day discharge after incision and drainage of soft-tissue abscess in diaper-age children is safe and effective background u.s. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.   methods we conducted a randomized trial at five u.s. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. the primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.   results the median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for mrsa. in the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.1 to 11.7; p=0.005). in the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, 3.2 to 11.2; p<0.001). trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% ci, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% ci, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. at 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.   conclusions in settings in which mrsa was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo.

phosphorylation-induced structural changes in the c-terminus of c-fos detected by cd and nmr the bzip proto-oncoprotein c-fos activates transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in cell growth. the c-terminal activation domain of c-fos is functionally independent of the remainder of the protein. fos-ad corresponds to the c-terminal activation domain of human c-fos (residues 216-380). fos-ad suppresses (squelches) transcription in vitro, as expected for a functional activation domain lacking a dna-binding domain. fos-ad is unstructured and highly mobile, as demonstrated by circular dichroism spectra indicative of unfolded proteins, a lack of (1)h chemical shift dispersion, and negative (1)h-(15)n heteronuclear nuclear overhauser effects. the hydrodynamic properties of fos-ad are also consistent with an extended structure. we conclude that the c-terminal domain of human c-fos is biologically active yet intrinsically disordered. our results suggest that conformational disorder is an integral aspect of the diverse contributions to transcriptional regulation by c-fos.
initial stop voicing in bilingual children with cochlear implants and their typically developing peers with normal hearing. purpose common wisdom suggests that listening in noise poses disproportionately greater difficulty for listeners with cochlear implants (cis) than for peers with normal hearing (nh). the purpose of this study was to examine phonological, language, and cognitive skills that might help explain speech-in-noise abilities for children with cis.   method three groups of kindergartners (nh, hearing aid wearers, and ci users) were tested on speech recognition in quiet and noise and on tasks thought to underlie the abilities that fit into the domains of phonological awareness, general language, and cognitive skills. these last measures were used as predictor variables in regression analyses with speech-in-noise scores as dependent variables.   results compared to children with nh, children with cis did not perform as well on speech recognition in noise or on most other measures, including recognition in quiet. two surprising results were that (a) noise effects were consistent across groups and (b) scores on other measures did not explain any group differences in speech recognition.   conclusions limitations of implant processing take their primary toll on recognition in quiet and account for poor speech recognition and language/phonological deficits in children with cis. implications are that teachers/clinicians need to teach language/phonology directly and maximize signal-to-noise levels in the classroom.
genes involved in human sialic acid biology do not harbor signatures of recent positive selection abstract the surface of all mammalian cells is covered with a dense and complex array of sugar chains, which are frequently terminated by members of a family of molecules called sialic acids. one particular sialic acid called n‐glycolylneuraminic acid (neu5gc) is widely expressed on most mammalian tissues, but is not easily detectable on human cells. in fact, it provokes an immune response in adult humans. the human deficiency of neu5gc is explained by an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding cmp‐n‐acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in generating neu5gc in cells of other mammals. this deficiency also results in an excess of the precursor sialic acid n‐acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac) in humans. this mutation appears universal to modern humans, occurred sometime after our last common ancestor with the great apes, and happens to be one of the first known human‐great ape genetic differences with an obvious biochemical readout. while the original selection mechanisms and major biological consequences of this human‐specific mutation remain uncertain, several interesting clues are currently being pursued. first, there is evidence that the human condition can explain differences in susceptibility or resistance to certain microbial pathogens. second, the functions of some endogenous receptors for sialic acids in the immune system may be altered by this difference. third, despite the lack of any obvious alternate pathway for synthesis, neu5gc has been reported in human tumors and possibly in human fetal tissues, and traces have even been detected in normal human tissues. one possible explanation is that this represents accumulation of neu5gc from dietary sources of animal origin. finally, a markedly reduced expression of hydroxylase in the brains of other mammals raises the possibility that the human‐specific mutation of this enzyme could have played a role in human brain evolution. yrbk phys anthropol 44:54–69, 2001. © 2001 wiley‐liss, inc.
a distinct expression pattern of the long 3′-untranslated region dicer mrna and its implications for posttranscriptional regulation in colorectal cancer the current model for colorectal tumorigenesis defines four specific mutations (activation of a ras proto-oncogene and inactivation of the apc, p53 and dcc tumor-suppressor genes) that accumulate in a colonic epithelial cell as it progresses towards a carcinoma. however, further mutations must be needed for progression to malignancy because advanced adenomas have been observed with all four of these mutations. loss of heterozygosity (loh) for 11 loci spanning the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 14 was studied in 89 sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas and 25 adenomas. the overall rate of loh in carcinomas was 53% (46/86 informative carcinomas). the smallest region of overlap (sro) of deletions includes the markers d14s19 to d14s20. no loh was seen in the 18 informative adenomas examined. there was a significant trend towards higher levels of loh within the sro in advanced dukes' stages (p = 0.016). since frequent loss of heterozygosity in a specific region of a chromosome may reflect the inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene located there, these data suggest that a gene involved in the progression of colonic neoplasia may reside on the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 14, and that its inactivation may be a critical event in this process.
analysis of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity risk factors in iranian patients with solid tumors: a cohort, prospective and single institute study cisplatin is an effective chemotherapy agent against several pediatric malignancies. one of its side effects is irreversible sensorineural hearing damage that is highly variable with a reported incidence of 22–70%. the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and identify clinical predictors of cisplatin‐related ototoxicity.
sert-to-dat ratios in early parkinson’s disease do not correlate with the development of dyskinesias purposeacute monoamine depletion paradigms using alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (ampt) combined with single photon emission computed tomography (spect) have been used successfully to evaluate disturbances in central dopaminergic neurotransmission. however, severe side effects due to relatively high doses (4,500 to 8,000 mg) of ampt have been reasons for study withdrawal. thus, we assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of two alternative procedures, using lower doses of ampt.methodssix healthy subjects underwent three measurements of striatal dopamine d2 receptor (d2r)-binding potential (bpnd) with spect and the selective radiolabeled d2r antagonist [123i]ibzm. all subjects were scanned in the absence of pharmacological intervention (baseline) and after two different depletion procedures. in the first depletion session, over 6 h, subjects were administered 1,500 mg of ampt before scanning. in the second depletion session, over 25 h, subjects were administered 40 mg ampt/kg body weight. we also administered the subjective well-being under neuroleptic treatment scale, a self-report instrument designed to measure the subjective experience of patients on neuroleptic medication.resultswe found no change of mean d2r bpnd after the first and short ampt challenge compared to the baseline. however, we found a significant increase in striatal d2r bpnd binding after the ampt challenge adjusted for bodyweight compared to both other regimen. although subjective well-being worsened after the prolonged ampt challenge, no severe side effects were reported.conclusionsour results imply a low-dosage, suitable alternative to the common ampt procedure. the probability of side effects and study withdrawal can be reduced by this procedure.
presence of a carboxy-terminal pseudorepeat and disease-like pseudohyperphosphorylation critically influence tau’s interaction with microtubules in axon-like processes during the development of neurons, the microtubule‐associated tau proteins show a graded proximo‐distal distribution in axons. in tauopathies such as alzheimer's disease, tau accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment. to scrutinize the determinants of tau's distribution and motion, we constructed photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (gfp)‐tagged tau fusion proteins and recorded their distribution after focal activation in living cells. simulation showed that the motion of tau was compatible with diffusion/reaction as opposed to active transport/reaction. effective diffusion constants of 0.7–0.8 μm2/second were calculated in neurites of pc12 cells and primary cortical neurons. furthermore, tau's amino terminal projection domain mediated binding and enrichment of tau at distal neurites indicating that the tip of a neurite acts as an adsorber trapping tau protein. treatment with taxol, incorporation of disease‐related tau modifications, experimentally induced hyperphosphorylation and addition of preaggregated amyloid β peptides (aβ) increased the effective diffusion constant compatible with a decreased binding to microtubules. distal enrichment was present after taxol treatment but was suppressed at disease‐relevant conditions. the data suggest that (i) dynamic binding of tau to microtubules and diffusion along microtubules and (ii) trapping at the tip of a neurite both contribute to its distribution during development and disease.
alexithymia, anxiety and depression in patients with psoriasis: a case–control study introduction alexithymia was originally defined as the inability to recognize and verbalize emotions. it is characterized by an emptiness of feelings, poverty of imagination or of a life fantasy and difficulties in communicating with other people, as well as lack of positive emotions and a high prevalence of negative emotions. its presence has been incriminated in the genesis and in the maintenance of various psychosomatic pathologies. psoriasis, a frequent dermatitis, is classified among psychosomatic pathologies. in fact, the psychological dimension seems important, either in the appearance of the illness, in its evolution or in its prognosis.   aims of the study estimate the prevalence of alexithymia among patients with psoriasis. study the relationship between them. patients' characteristics: fifty-three patients with psoriasis consulted the dermatology department of the hedi chaker university hospital, in sfax, tunisia. patients' mean age was 42 years (min: 18 years; max: 76 years). the majority was married (58%), coming from middle to low social economic status (86%), and having a primary or secondary school level (84%). psoriasis was vulgar for 47 patients (89%) and pustular for the others (11%).   methodology we built a case-control study of 53 patients with psoriasis. the control group was formed of 53 subjects without psoriasis and paired according sex, age and school level. we evaluated psoriasis severity using the psoriasis area and severity index (pasi), a standardised instrument permitting assessment of the global severity of psoriasis. a cut off of 12 was used to diagnose severe psoriasis. alexithymia was assessed with the 20-item version of the toronto alexithymia scale (tas-20). this instrument has shown to be the best validated instrument for measuring alexithymia. a cut off of 61 was used to diagnose alexithymia. sociodemographical and clinical data were assessed by a questionnaire that was filled in by the doctor conducting the study. all analyses were performed using the spss version 11.0 and with a 95% confidence interval. differences in groups were tested using student's independent t-test, and chi-square.   results the mean score of alexithymia for the patients was 56 (e: 12.1). the mean score of alexithymia for the control group was 45 (e: 9.6). thirty-nine decimal six percent (n: 21) of patients and 13.2% (n: 7) of controls exhibited alexithymia. our results confirm the high prevalence of alexithymia among patients with psoriasis (39.6%) compared to controls (13.2%) (p: 0.0002, rr: 3.4). a stress factor was present before the apparition of psoriasis in half of the cases. psoriasis was severe in 50% of cases. women with psoriasis (and not men) presented severe psoriasis when they suffered from alexithymia (p: 0.049). the relationship between alexithymia and age was significant from the age of 40 (p: 0.024). the association between psoriasis and another psychosomatic diseases was significantly more important than for the controls (p: 0.03; rr: 4.6). psoriasis was not correlated to psychoactive substance (tobacco and alcohol, in our study). however, in the group of patients with alexithymia, alcohol consumption was associated with psoriasis severity (p: 0.05).   discussion in alexithymia, there is a risk that physical and emotional feelings will be used without distinction as signs of psychological distress, which can explain the somatic complaint due to the lack of the expression of psychological suffering. this can lead to the apparition of psoriasis. the relationship between psoriasis and alexithymia is increasingly studied in epidemiological surveys that use different instruments to measure alexithymia. however, the results of these surveys do not concord with ours. our results demonstrated a close link between the two conditions. moreover, the risk of further psychosomatic diseases increases in the presence of alexithymia. the consumption of alcohol was also high in cases of severe forms of psoriasis.   conclusion alexithymia does not appear to be a simple condition, related to psoriasis, but a worsening of the condition, exposing the patient to the association of other psychosomatic diseases and alcoholism, and thus worsening the global prognosis of these patients. the psychological approach, which favours the expression of emotions and permits a symbolic dimension, is as important as the biological approach, and necessary for the improvement of these patients.
activation of ppar α attenuates ifn γ and il-1 β-induced cell proliferation in astrocytes : involvement of il-6 independent pathway the il-12 family of cytokines, which include il-12, il-23, and il-27, play critical roles in the differentiation of th1 cells and are believed to contribute to the development of multiple sclerosis (ms) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), an animal model of ms. relatively little is known concerning the expression of il-12 family cytokines by cells of the cns, the affected tissue in ms. previously, we and others demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-γ agonists suppress the development of eae, alter t cell proliferation and phenotype, and suppress the activation of apcs. the present studies demonstrated that ppar-γ agonists, including the naturally occurring 15-deoxy-δ12,14-pgj2 and the synthetic thiazoladinedione rosiglitazone, inhibited the induction of il-12p40, il-12p70 (p35/p40), il-23 (p19/p40), and il-27p28 proteins by lps-stimulated primary microglia. in primary astrocytes, lps induced the production of il-12p40, il-23, and il-27p28 proteins. however, il-12p70 production was not detected in these cells. the 15-deoxy-δ12,14-pgj2 potently suppressed il-12p40, il-23, and il-27p28 production by primary astrocytes, whereas rosiglitazone suppressed il-23 and il-27p28, but not il-12p40 in these cells. these novel observations suggest that ppar-γ agonists modulate the development of eae, at least in part, by inhibiting the production of il-12 family cytokines by cns glia. in addition, we demonstrate that ppar-γ agonists inhibit tlr2, myd88, and cd14 expression in glia, suggesting a possible mechanism by which these agonists modulate il-12 family cytokine expression. collectively, these studies suggest that ppar-γ agonists may be beneficial in the treatment of ms.
ovarian granulosa cell tumor: a national cancer database study. objective to analyze the role of surgical staging and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with adult type granulosa cell tumor (gct) of the ovary.   methods patients were divided into those with early-stage (stages i-ii, n=93) and advanced-stage (stages iii-iv, n=13) gct and analyzed separately in this retrospective study.   results of the 93 patients with early-stage gct, 30 were completely staged and 25 underwent lymph node dissection. after surgery, 17 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin (bep). none had lymph node metastasis. completely staged patients had no recurrence or deaths. however, recurrences were observed in 9 of 63 patients (14.3%) who did not undergo complete staging, with four (6.3%) dying due to disease. the 5-year disease-free survival (dfs) rates of groups with and without complete staging were 100% and 84%, respectively (p=0.037). adjuvant chemotherapy was not significantly associated with dfs (p=0.193). all patients with advanced-stage gct underwent optimal cytoreduction and received adjuvant chemotherapy with bep. none of the 6 patients who completed 6 cycles of bep had recurrence, whereas 5 of the 7 patients (71.4%) who received fewer than 6 cycles of bep had recurrences and 3 (42.9%) died due to disease. the 5-year dfs rates of these two groups were 100% and 50%, respectively (p=0.022), with cycles of chemotherapy being the only significant factor for dfs in patients with advanced-stage gct.   conclusions complete surgical staging is recommended, but lymph node removal is not recommended for early-stage gct. optimal debulking followed by six cycles of bep chemotherapy is recommended for advanced-stage gct.
photobiomodulation reduces neutrophil migration and oxidative stress in mice with carrageenan-induced peritonitis arthritis of the knee is the most common type of joint inflammatory disorder and it is associated with pain and inflammation of the joint capsule. few studies address the effects of the 810-nm laser in such conditions. here we investigated the effects of low-level laser therapy (lllt; infrared, 810-nm) in experimentally induced rat knee inflammation. thirty male wistar rats (230–250 g) were anesthetized and injected with carrageenan by an intra-articular route. after 6 and 12 h, all animals were killed by co2 inhalation and the articular cavity was washed for cellular and biochemical analysis. articular tissue was carefully removed for real-time pcr analysis in order to evaluate cox-1 and cox-2 expression. lllt was able to significantly inhibit the total number of leukocytes, as well as the myeloperoxidase activity with 1, 3, and 6 j (joules) of energy. this result was corroborated by cell counting showing the reduction of polymorphonuclear cells at the inflammatory site. vascular extravasation was significantly inhibited at the higher dose of energy of 10 j. both cox-1 and 2 gene expression were significantly enhanced by laser irradiation while pge2 production was inhibited. low-level laser therapy operating at 810 nm markedly reduced inflammatory signs of inflammation but increased cox-1 and 2 gene expression. further studies are necessary to investigate the possible production of antiinflammatory mediators by cox enzymes induced by laser irradiation in knee inflammation.
neutral endopeptidase inhibition potentiates the natriuretic actions of adrenomedullin in order to elucidate the role of adrenomedullin in the kidney, we investigated the effects of adrenomedullin on renal hemodynamics and urine formation in anesthetized dogs. intrarenal arterial infusion of adrenomedullin (0.8, 4 and 20 ng.kg-1.min-1) elicited dose-dependent increases in renal blood flow (by 10, 26 and 37%, respectively) with no change in blood pressure or heart rate, indicating a renal vasodilatory action of adrenomedullin. the glomerular filtration rate did not increase with the lower two doses, but increased marginally by 9% at the highest dose. infusion of adrenomedullin at the rates of 4 and 20 ng.kg-1.min-1 increased urine flow and the urinary excretion of sodium and potassium dose dependently. arterial and renal venous plasma renin activity was unaffected by adrenomedullin. these findings indicate that adrenomedullin is a potent renal vasodilatory peptide with a diuretic action. since the threshold for the renal vasodilatory action of adrenomedullin is close to its physiological concentration in human plasma, adrenomedullin may play an important role in the regulation of renal function.
posterior capsule opacification after cataract surgery and its determinants a complication of extracapsular cataract extraction with or without posterior chamber intraocular lens (pc-iol) implantation is posterior capsule opacification. this condition is usually secondary to a proliferation and migration of residual lens epithelial cells. opacification may be reduced by atraumatic surgery and thorough cortical clean-up. clinical, pathological and experimental studies have shown that use of hydrodissection, the continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis and specific iol designs may help reduce the incidence of this complication. capsular-fixated, one-piece all-polymethylmethacrylate pc-iols with a c-shaped loop configuration and a posterior convexity of the optic are effective. polymethylmethacrylate loops that retain "memory" create a symmetric, radial stretch on the posterior capsule after in-the-bag placement, leading to a more complete contact between the posterior surface of the iol optic and the taut capsule. this may help form a barrier against central migration of epithelial cells into the visual axis. various pharmacological and immunological methods are being investigated but conclusive data on these modalities are not yet available.
neuromuscular and biomechanical coupling in human cycling: modulation of cutaneous reflex responses to sural nerve stimulation 1. the phase-dependent modulation of medium-latency (p2) (70-80 ms) responses in semitendinosus (st), biceps femoris (bf), rectus femoris (rf), and tibialis anterior (ta) was studied with the use of low-intensity stimulation (2 times perception threshold) of the sural nerve. the shocks were given in a random order at 16 phases of the step cycle in 10 normal subjects during forward walking (fw) or backward walking (bw) on a treadmill. 2. all subjects exhibited p2 responses in all muscles studied both during bw and fw. the amplitude of the facilitatory p2 responses showed phase-dependent changes that could not have been predicted on the basis of the variations in background activity throughout the step cycle. 3. during fw, the p2 facilitatory responses in bf were large (with respect to the background activity) throughout the whole step cycle except for a short period near the end of the swing phase. in st the responses were smaller and appeared primarily at the end of the stance phase and during the first part of the swing phase. during the second half of swing the p2 responses were basically suppressive. a modulation pattern similar to the one in st was found in rf and ta, except that there was no reversal to suppressive responses in the swing phase in rf. instead, a reduction in the amplitude of the facilitatory p2 responses occurred. 4. during bw, the modulation pattern recorded in the same subjects was different from the one seen during fw. large facilitatory p2 responses were present in all muscles in middle and late swing. in the first half of stance the responses were most prominently seen in bf and rf. at the end of stance and/or at the onset of swing the facilitatory responses decreased in amplitude (bf and rf) or reversed to p2 suppressions (st and ta). 5. we conclude that there are both facilitatory and suppressive pathways from the sural nerve to the leg muscles studied and that the balance of activity in these paths is phase dependent during both fw and bw. it is suggested that the phase-dependent modulation of p2 responses could largely rely on a central motor program. during bw the same motor program is used as during fw, but possibly running in reverse, thereby causing a shift both in the timing of the reflex reversal and in the periods of reflex suppression.
attribute pair-based visual recognition and memory previous research has suggested that visual short-term memory has a fixed capacity of about four objects. however, we found that capacity varied substantially across the five stimulus classes we examined, ranging from 1.6 for shaded cubes to 4.4 for colors (estimated using a change detection task). we also estimated the information load per item in each class, using visual search rate. the changes we measured in memory capacity across classes were almost exactly mirrored by changes in the opposite direction in visual search rate (r2 = .992 between search rate and the reciprocal of memory capacity). the greater the information load of each item in a stimulus class (as indicated by a slower search rate), the fewer items from that class one can hold in memory. extrapolating this linear relationship reveals that there is also an upper bound on capacity of approximately four or five objects. thus, both the visual information load and number of objects impose capacity limits on visual short-term memory.
differences in emotional stimuli processing in subjects with mtle with and without depression background excessive chronic drinking is accompanied by a broad spectrum of emotional changes ranging from apathy and emotional flatness to deficits in comprehending emotional information, but their neural bases are poorly understood.   methods emotional abnormalities associated with alcoholism were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging in abstinent long-term alcoholic men in comparison to healthy demographically matched controls. participants were presented with emotionally valenced words and photographs of faces during deep (semantic) and shallow (perceptual) encoding tasks followed by recognition.   results overall, faces evoked stronger activation than words, with the expected material-specific laterality (left hemisphere for words, and right for faces) and depth of processing effects. however, whereas control participants showed stronger activation in the amygdala and hippocampus when viewing faces with emotional (relative to neutral) expressions, the alcoholics responded in an undifferentiated manner to all facial expressions. in the alcoholic participants, amygdala activity was inversely correlated with an increase in lateral prefrontal activity as a function of their behavioral deficits. prefrontal modulation of emotional function as a compensation for the blunted amygdala activity during a socially relevant face appraisal task is in agreement with a distributed network engagement during emotional face processing.   conclusions deficient activation of amygdala and hippocampus may underlie impaired processing of emotional faces associated with long-term alcoholism and may be a part of the wide array of behavioral problems including disinhibition, concurring with previously documented interpersonal difficulties in this population. furthermore, the results suggest that alcoholics may rely on prefrontal rather than temporal limbic areas in order to compensate for reduced limbic responsivity and to maintain behavioral adequacy when faced with emotionally or socially challenging situations.
induction of ccl13 expression in synovial fibroblasts highlights a significant role of oncostatin m in rheumatoid arthritis. we investigated the extent to which fibroblasts isolated from diverse tissues differ in their capacity to modulate inflammation by comparing the global gene expression profiles of cultured human fibroblasts from skin, acute and chronically inflamed synovium, lymph node and tonsil. the responses of these fibroblasts to tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma and il-4 stimulation were markedly different, as revealed by hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis. in the absence of exogenous cytokine, synovial and skin fibroblasts exhibited similar patterns of gene expression. however their transcriptional profiles diverged upon treatment with tnf-alpha. this proved to be biologically relevant, as tnf-alpha induced the secretion of different patterns and amounts of il-6, il-8 and ccl2 (mcp-1) in the two fibroblast types. co-culture of skin or synovial fibroblasts with synovial fluid-derived mononuclear cells provided further evidence that these transcriptional differences were functionally significant in an ex vivo setting. interestingly, the transcriptional response of skin fibroblasts to il-4 converged with that of tnf-alpha-treated synovial fibroblasts, suggesting resident tissue fibroblasts and their blood-borne precursors may be imprinted by inflammatory cytokines that are characteristic of different tissues. our data supports the concept that fibroblasts are heterogeneous, and that they contribute to the tissue-specificity of inflammatory reactions. fibroblasts are therefore likely to play an active role in the persistence of chronic inflammatory reactions.
acute remapping within the motor system induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation we studied the effects of low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) on motor cortex excitability in humans. tms at 0.1 hz for 1 hour did not change cortical excitability. stimulation at 0.9 hz for 15 minutes (810 pulses), similar to the parameters used to induce long-term depression (ltd) in cortical slice preparations and in vivo animal studies, led to a mean decrease in motor evoked potential (mep) amplitude of 19.5%. the decrease in cortical excitability lasted for at least 15 minutes after the end of the 0.9 hz stimulation. the mechanism underlying this decrease in excitability may be similar to ltd. tms-induced reduction of cortical excitability has potential clinical applications in diseases such as epilepsy and myoclonus. spread of excitation, which may be a warning sign for seizures, occurred in one subject and was not accompanied by increased mep amplitude, suggesting that spread of excitation and amplitude changes are different phenomena and also indicating the need for adequate monitoring even with stimulations at low frequencies.
a data-driven approach to infer knowledge base representation for natural language relations learning embeddings of entities and relations is an efficient and versatile method to perform machine learning on relational data such as knowledge graphs. in this work, we propose holographic embeddings (hole) to learn compositional vector space representations of entire knowledge graphs. the proposed method is related to holographic models of associative memory in that it employs circular correlation to create compositional representations. by using correlation as the compositional operator, hole can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. experimentally, we show that holographic embeddings are able to outperform state-of-the-art methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs and relational learning benchmark datasets.
nerve growth factor and doublecortin expression correlates with improved outcome in children with severe traumatic brain injury. nerve growth factor (ngf) was discovered 50 years ago as a molecule that promoted the survival and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic neurons. its roles in neural development have been characterized extensively, but recent findings point to an unexpected diversity of ngf actions and indicate that developmental effects are only one aspect of the biology of ngf. this article considers expanded roles for ngf that are associated with the dynamically regulated production of ngf and its receptors that begins in development, extends throughout adult life and aging, and involves a surprising variety of neurons, glia, and nonneural cells. particular attention is given to a growing body of evidence that suggests that among other roles, endogenous ngf signaling subserves neuroprotective and repair functions. the analysis points to many interesting unanswered questions and to the potential for continuing research on ngf to substantially enhance our understanding of the mechanisms and treatment of neurological disorders.
terahertz electromagnetic fields (0.106 thz) do not induce manifest genomic damage in vitro emerging technologies are considering the possible use of terahertz radiation in different fields ranging from telecommunications to biology and biomedicine. the study of the potential effects of terahertz radiation on biological systems is therefore an important issue in order to safely develop a variety of applications. this paper describes a pilot study devoted to determine if terahertz radiation could induce genotoxic effects in human peripheral blood leukocytes. for this purpose, human whole blood samples from healthy donors were exposed for 20 min to terahertz radiation. since, to our knowledge, this is the first study devoted to the evaluation of possible genotoxic effects of such radiation, different electromagnetic conditions were considered. in particular, the frequencies of 120 and 130 ghz were chosen: the first one was tested at a specific absorption rate (sar) of 0.4 mw g−1, while the second one was tested at sar levels of 0.24, 1.4, and 2 mw g−1. chromosomal damage was evaluated by means of the cytokinesis block micronucleus technique, which also gives information on cell cycle kinetics. moreover, human whole blood samples exposed to 130 ghz at sar levels of 1.4 and 2 mw g−1 were also tested for primary dna damage by applying the alkaline comet assay immediately after exposure. the results obtained indicate that thz exposure, in the explored electromagnetic conditions, is not able to induce either genotoxicity or alteration of cell cycle kinetics in human blood cells from healthy subjects.
improving the quality of adult mortality data collected in demographic surveys: validation study of a new siblings' survival questionnaire in niakhar, senegal this study examines heaping of reported durations of three postpartum variables in five countries based on two methods of data collection in retrospective surveys. two demographic and health surveys were conducted for each of the countries, one that used a five-year month-by-month calendar to record the durations and a subsequent survey in which duration information was collected from simple questions in the body of the questionnaire. heaping indexes were calculated for breastfeeding, amenorrhea, and abstinence at six, 12, 18, and 24 months postpartum. use of the calendar was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of heaped responses for both breastfeeding and amenorrhea, and the effect increased for longer durations. to obtain more accurate information about these variables, the authors recommend the use of the calendar.
a quantitative approach to blastocyst quality evaluation: morphometric analysis and related ivf outcomes objective to investigate the predictive value of quantitative measurements of blastocyst morphology on subsequent implantation rates after transfer.   design prospective observational study.   setting private assisted reproductive technology center.   patient(s) one hundred seventy-four ivf patients receiving transfers of expanded blastocyst-stage embryos on day 5 (n = 112) or day 6 (n = 62) after oocyte retrieval.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) blastocyst diameter, number of trophectoderm cells, inner cell mass (icm) size, icm shape, and implantation and pregnancy rates.   result(s) blastocyst diameter and trophectoderm cell numbers were unrelated to implantation rates. day 5 expanded blastocysts with icms of >4,500 microm(2) implanted at a higher rate than did those with smaller icms (55% vs. 31%). day 5 expanded blastocysts with slightly oval icms implanted at a higher rate (58%) compared with those with either rounder icms (7%) or more elongated icms (33%). implantation rates were highest (71%) for embryos with both optimal icm size and shape. pregnancy rates were higher for day 5 transfers of optimally shaped icms compared with day 5 transfers of optimally sized icms.   conclusion(s) quantitative measurements of the inner cell mass are highly indicative of blastocyst implantation potential. blastocysts with relatively large and/or slightly oval icms are more likely to implant than other blastocysts.
mody in ukraine: genes, clinical phenotypes and treatment aims/hypothesismaturity-onset diabetes of the young is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. a correct diagnosis of mody is important for determining treatment, but can only be confirmed by molecular genetic testing. we aimed to compare the regional distribution of confirmed mody cases in the uk and to estimate the minimum prevalence.methodsuk referrals for genetic testing in 2,072 probands and 1,280 relatives between 1996 and 2009 were examined by region, country and test result. referral rate and prevalence were calculated using uk census 2001 figures.resultsmody was confirmed in 1,177 (35%) patients, with hnf1a (52%) and gck mutations (32%) being most frequent in probands confirmed with mody. there was considerable regional variation in proband referral rates (from <20 per million in wales and northern ireland to >50 per million for south west england and scotland) and patients diagnosed with mody (5.3 per million in northern ireland, 48.9 per million in south west england). referral rates and confirmed cases were highly correlated (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001). the minimum prevalence of mody was estimated to be 108 cases per million.conclusions/interpretationassuming this minimal prevalence throughout the uk then >80% of mody is not diagnosed by molecular testing. the marked regional variation in the prevalence of confirmed mody directly results from differences in referral rates. this could reflect variation in awareness of mody or unequal access to genetic testing. increased referral for diagnostic testing is required if the majority of mody patients are to have the genetic diagnosis necessary for optimal treatment.
homocysteine and carotid intima-media thickness in ischemic stroke patients are not correlated objective hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with atherosclerotic risk. although vitamins can lower homocysteine (hcy), information about effects on atherosclerosis is scarce.   methods we used carotid intima-media thickness (imt) as an accepted marker of atherosclerotic changes. fifty patients (60 +/- 8 years) with imt> or =1 mm were included. in a double blind, randomized trial they received daily 2.5 mg folic acid, 25 mg vitamin b6, and 0.5mg vitamin b12 or placebo for 1 year.   results in the treatment group, hcy decreased from 10.50 +/- 3.93 to 6.56 +/- 1.53 micromol/l (p < 0.0001), whereas it remained unchanged in the placebo group (10.76 +/- 2.36 versus 10.45+/-3.30 micromol/l). imt decreased from 1.50 +/- 0.44 to 1.42 +/- 0.48 mm (p = 0.034) in the treatment group, whereas it increased from 1.47 +/- 0.57 to 1.54 +/- 0.71 mm in the placebo group. the mean individual changes of imt between both groups differed significantly (-0.08 +/- 0.17 versus 0.07 +/- 0.25 mm, p = 0.019). multiple regression analysis revealed that the observed effect on imt depended only on medication.   conclusions vitamin supplementation significantly reduces imt in patients at risk. this effect is independent of hcy concentration.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
prevalence, phenotype and cardiometabolic risk of polycystic ovary syndrome under different diagnostic criteria. to determine the prevalence of polycystic ovaries as identified by ultrasound in a group of young, postmenarcheal women in the normal population, and to investigate how polycystic ovaries are related to the spectrum of clinical and biochemical symptoms associated with the polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos).
pre-clinical effects of metformin and aspirin on the cell lines of different breast cancer subtypes breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer and second leading cause of mortality in women. metformin is a widely prescribed anti-hyperglycemic drug, which is emerging as a potential cancer preventative and treatment agent. however, the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of metformin on cancer cell growth and the induction of cancer cell apoptosis are not fully elucidated. the present study aimed to identify the pathways regulated by metformin in two breast cancer cell lines, mda-mb-231 and mda-mb-435. cells were treated with various concentrations of metformin and then evaluated with respect to viability, proliferation, adenosine triphosphate (atp) and reactive oxygen species (ros) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm), and the expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins. metformin caused apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and decreased cell viability and atp production. furthermore, metformin induced the generation of ros and decreased the ∆ψm. moreover, metformin downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins b-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia-1, and upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic bcl-2-associated x protein in mda-mb-231 cells. these results demonstrate that the apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of metformin on breast cancer cells are mediated by the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway.
the economic burden of the ankylosing spondylitis in the czech republic: comparison between 2005 and 2008 objectives in trial-based analyses, the human capital (hc) approach is currently applied alternately with and without the incorporation of productivity costs for persons who are work disabled at baseline of the trial. we call these methods hc-extended (hc(ext)) and hc-limited (hc(lim)), respectively. aim of the paper is to compare productivity costs according to hc(ext) with hc(lim) and the friction cost (fc) method, in patients with borderline personality disorder (bpd).   methods data were obtained from a multicenter randomized trial in the netherlands, comparing two types of outpatient psychotherapy, schema focused therapy (sft, n = 44) versus transference focused psychotherapy (tfp, n = 42) for bpd. mean age was 31.7 for sft and 29.5 for tfp. a cost-interview was administered every three months for three years, and once again after the fourth year. productivity costs were calculated according to hc(lim), hc(ext) and fc. a nonparametric bootstrap resampling method was performed.   results during the trial, the number of work-disabled patients increased for both treatments. total productivity costs for hc(ext) were higher than for hc(lim) and fc. in addition, the incremental bootstrapped costs (tfp - sft) pointed in the same direction for hc(lim) (1168 euro; 95% ui 4700 euro, 7563 euro) and fc (1206 euro; -2835 euro, 4844 euro), but turned around for hc(ext)(minus 1240 euro; -9973 euro, 7911 euro). none of the increments were statistically significantly different from zero.   conclusions the classical and frequently discussed contrast between hc and fc is not the only difference when it concerns productivity costs. whether or not including productivity costs for patients who are work-disabled at baseline can lead to contradictory conclusions.
expression of p73, a novel protein related to the p53 tumour suppressor p53, and apoptosis in cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver background & aims we previously reported that intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (iccs) can be divided into three categories according to their gross appearance with possible links to biological behavior. ki-ras and p53 gene alterations are thought to be involved in early and late phases of carcinogenesis, respectively. this study was performed to investigate the relationship between the gross appearance and genetic alterations of icc.   methods we examined 21 patients with icc. ki-ras point mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism methods followed by direct dna sequencing. expressions of p53 protein were immunohistochemically assessed.   results ki-ras point mutations were found in 10 patients (48%), and expressions of p53 protein were detected in 4 (19%). applying the gross classification that we previously proposed, ki-ras mutations were prominent in the periductal extension type (4 of 6; 67%) and the spicula-forming type (6 of 10; 60%). on the other hand, none of the five mass-forming-type tumors harbored ki-ras mutations. expressions of p53 protein did not show any clear association with gross appearance.   conclusions ki-ras gene alterations may be involved in the cholangiocarcinogenesis of periductal extension and spicula-forming but not mass-forming types, suggesting that the underlying processes of development are different.
the shark chiloscyllium griseum can orient using turn responses before and after partial telencephalon ablation the present work analyzes the involvement of telencephalon of goldfish in spatial strategies, using a procedure analogue to the hole-board task. with this aim, goldfish with sham operation or telencephalon ablation were trained to find a baited feeder within a twenty-five feeder matrix, which maintained stable spatial relationships relative to five peripheral landmarks. after training, different types of probe tests were conducted. although both groups learned the task, probe trials showed that whereas the sham animals used the whole configuration of cues to implement map-like strategies the telencephalic animals used a guidance strategy based on cues located in the vicinity of the baited feeder. these results confirm the role of teleost fish telencephalon in the use of allocentric strategies obtained with other spatial procedures, and indicate that the hole-board task described here for goldfish is a useful tool to assess the neural bases of spatial cognition in teleost fish.
medical documentation, bioanalytical evidence of an accidental human exposure to sulfur mustard and general therapy recommendations. the persistence in rats of sulfur mustard adducts to albumin and hemoglobin was studied in vivo after exposure (intravenously; 0.3 mg/kg; approximately 0.1 ld(50)) of rats to sulfur mustard. the albumin adduct (s-hete)cys-pro-tyr was detectable up to 7 days after the exposure, while the adduct to the n-terminal valine in hemoglobin was still detected after 28 days. the decrease in adduct levels corresponded well with the half-life time of albumin in rats and with the lifetime of the rat erythrocyte. remarkably, the n-terminal valine adduct to hemoglobin increased during the first three days, which implies that there is still free sulfur mustard present during that time. in contrast, the corresponding albumin adduct levels did not increase during this time period. the free sulfur mustard might have accumulated in the erythrocyte cell membrane.
can pubertal boys with klinefelter syndrome benefit from spermatogonial stem cell banking? context the pathogenesis and mechanisms behind the degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in testes of subjects with klinefelter syndrome (ks) are yet unknown.   objective the objective of this prospective clinical study was to characterize the testicular degeneration process during puberty in boys with ks by describing the immunoexpression of some developmentally regulated markers of testis maturation in relation to serum levels of reproductive hormones.   setting this study was conducted at a university central hospital pediatric referral endocrinology outpatient clinic.   patients patients consisted of 14 boys with ks aged 10.1 to 14.0 yr.   main outcome measures main outcome measures were immunoexpression of germ cell differentiation markers (ap-2gamma, chk2, oct-3/4, ny-eso-1, mage-a4) and androgen action-related proteins [androgen receptor (ar), anti-müllerian hormone (amh), mic2, inhibin b; alpha- and betab-subunits] in testicular biopsies of boys with ks in relation to serum reproductive hormone levels.   results in boys with ks, gonocytes differentiated to the spermatogonium stage, but no spermatocytes were visible. despite this, down-regulation of amh expression in the sertoli cells occurred concomitantly with decreasing serum amh levels. expression of inhibin alpha- and betab-subunits appeared in the biopsies even when circulating inhibin b levels were undetectable. in the boys with ks compared with age-matched controls, the proportion of sertoli cell nuclei expressing ar was smaller and cytoplasmic staining of sertoli cells was constantly present.   conclusions we showed with several testis-specific markers in ks that gonocytes differentiate to spermatogonia and that the degeneration of the testes accelerates at the onset of puberty. altered immunoexpression of ar indicates that a relative androgen deficiency, at least at the testicular level, develops in boys with ks during puberty.
hearing changes associated to complications and comorbidities in type 2 diabetes mellitus alterações auditivas associadas a complicações e comorbidades no diabetes mellitus tipo 2 hearing threshold of 40 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and 20 healthy controls were determined using pure tone audiometry of frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 hz and evoked otoacoustic emissions (eoaes). the hypoacusis was bilateral, progressive and neurosensory nature, affecting the higher frequencies. subjects with diabetes type 2 were more likely to have a hearing loss than were subjects without diabetes (95% vs 65%). this difference was statistically significant. hearing loss was significantly correlated with age and duration of diabetes. evoked otoacoustic emissions found out only in 2 patients with normal hearing. the results suggest that eoaes doesn't show subclinical cochlear damage in diabetic patients because of the significant hearing loss.
a new method for extracting skin microbes allows metagenomic analysis of whole-deep skin host-commensal relationships in the skin are a complex system governed by variables related to the host, the bacteria and the environment. a disruption of this system may lead to new steady states, which, in turn, may lead to disease. we have studied one such disruption by characterizing the skin microbiota in healthy and immunodepressed (id) mice. a detailed anatomopathological study failed to reveal any difference between the skin of healthy and id mice. we sequenced the 16s rdna v1-v2 gene region to saturation in 10 healthy and 10 id 8 week-old mice, and found than all of the healthy and two of the id mice had bacterial communities that were similar in composition to that of human skin, although, presumably because of the uniform raising conditions, less interindividual variation was found in mice. however, eight id mice showed microbiota dominated by staphylococcus epidermidis. quantitative pcr amplification of 16s rdna gene and of the staphylococcus-specific tstag region confirmed the previous results and indicated that the quantitative levels of staphylococcus were similar in both groups while the total number of 16s copies was greater in the healthy mice. thus, it is possible that, under long-term immunodeficiency, which removes the acquired but not the native immune system, s.epidermidis may inhibit the growth of other bacteria but does not cause a pathogenic state.
an algorithm for mining weighted dense maximal 1-complete regions mining frequent closed itemsets provides complete and non-redundant results for frequent pattern analysis. extensive studies have proposed various strategies for efficient frequent closed itemset mining, such as depth-first search vs. breadthfirst search, vertical formats vs. horizontal formats, tree-structure vs. other data structures, top-down vs. bottom-up traversal, pseudo projection vs. physical projection of conditional database, etc. it is the right time to ask "what are the pros and cons of the strategies?" and "what and how can we pick and integrate the best strategies to achieve higher performance in general cases?"in this study, we answer the above questions by a systematic study of the search strategies and develop a winning algorithm closet+. closet+ integrates the advantages of the previously proposed effective strategies as well as some ones newly developed here. a thorough performance study on synthetic and real data sets has shown the advantages of the strategies and the improvement of closet+ over existing mining algorithms, including closet, charm and op, in terms of runtime, memory usage and scalability.
pre-existing chiasma syndromes do not entirely remit following transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas summarythe lack of a standard quantitative method of assessing the degree of visual deficit hinders comparison of the results of the different methods available for treating visual failure due to a pituitary tumour.this report describes a simple, semi-quantitative, and precise approach, and illustrates its use in 34 patients treated by transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and radiotherapy. visual improvement occurred in 85%, and no patient sustained deterioration of vision. visual loss before operation was scored at a mean of 51.4%, and was reduced to a mean of 27.4% after a minimum of 12 months follow-up. the factor that had the greatest influence on visual recovery was the degree of visual loss at presentation. it is therefore essential to be able to compare this variable before attempting to assess if outcome is different in patients treated by different methods.
a new electrode for residual hearing preservation in cochlear implantation: first clinical results objective:to report on combined ipsilateral electrical and acoustic stimulation in a subset of conventional candidates for cochlear implantation where preoperative pure tone thresholds were ≤60 db hl for 250 and 500 hz. methods: subjects were 10 adults implanted with the nucleus 24 contour advance perimodiolar electrode array. soft surgical procedures were strictly observed: ≤1.5-mm cochleostomy hole placed anterior and inferior to the round window, a healon bubble placed over the opening to prevent entry of foreign bodies, and no suction applied. the electrode array was inserted 17 mm to the first marker rib using the recommended ‘advance-off-stylet’ technique. pure tone hearing threshold levels were recorded pre-, and postoperatively at 1–2 and 6–12 months. speech recognition was tested for cochlear implant (ci) alone and combined with ipsilateral hearing aid for 7 subjects who retained significant residual hearing in the implanted ear at 1–2 months after operation. results: there were 3/10 cases where 1–2 months after operation low-frequency responses were considered vibrotactile only (>85–110 db hl, 250–500 hz). in the remaining 7 cases, residual hearing was maintained up to at least 6 months after operation with minor changes. insertion depth angles in these cases ranged from 285 to 420°. for these subjects, the mean preoperative score for words presented at 65 db spl was 22%. mean postoperative scores were 56% for ci alone, and 68% for ci plus ipsilateral hearing aid (p < 0.05, paired t). for sentences presented in multitalker babble noise at 5 db snr, mean scores were 61% ci alone, and 75% ci+ipsiha (p < 0.01, paired t). conclusions: hearing was conserved during surgery and over time in 70% of conventional candidates implanted with the nucleus 24 contour advance ci who had significant levels of preoperative low-frequency residual hearing (≤60 db hl). these conventional candidates for ci also benefited from improved speech recognition in noise when using combined ipsilateral electrical and acoustic stimulation.
cerebral metabolic changes related to clinical parameters in idiopathic anosmic patients during olfactory stimulation: a pilot investigation although multivariate analytic techniques might identify diagnostic patterns that are not captured by univariate methods, they have rarely been used to study the neural correlates of alzheimer's disease (ad) or cognitive impairment. nonquantitative h2(15)o pet scans were acquired during rest in 17 probable ad subjects selected for mild severity [mean-modified mini mental status examination (mmms) 46/57; sd 5.1], 16 control subjects (mmms 54; sd 2.5) and 23 subjects with minimal to mild cognitive impairment but no dementia (mmms 53; sd 2.8). expert clinical reading had low success in discriminating ad and controls. there were no significant mean flow differences among groups in traditional univariate spm noxel-wise analyses or region of interest (roi) analyses. a covariance pattern was identified whose mean expression was significantly higher in the ad as compared to controls (p = 0.03; sensitivity 76-94%; specificity 63-81%). sites of increased concomitant flow included insula, cuneus, pulvinar, lingual, fusiform, superior occipital and parahippocampal gyri, whereas decreased concomitant flow was found in cingulate, inferior parietal lobule, middle and inferior frontal, supramarginal and precentral gyri. the covariance analysis-derived pattern was then prospectively applied to the cognitively impaired subjects: as compared to subjects with clinical dementia rating (cdr) = 0, subjects with cdr = 0.5 had significantly higher mean covariance pattern expression (p = 0.009). expression of this pattern correlated inversely with selective reminding test total recall (r = -0.401, p = 0.002), delayed recall (r = -0.351, p = 0.008) and mmms scores (r = -0.401, p = 0.002) in all three groups combined. we conclude that patients with ad may differentially express resting cerebral blood flow covariance patterns even at very early disease stages. significant alterations in expression of resting flow covariance patterns occur even for subjects with cognitive impairment. expression of covariance patterns correlates with cognitive and functional performance measures, holding promise for meaningful associations with underlying biopathological processes.
leading the way in genetic fertility screening fertility genetics # 1 in genetic fertility screening volume 1 magazine is there a small rna fingerprint of embryo quality and health in spent ivf media ? objective to study the possible contribution of paternal, in addition to maternal, carriage of m2/anxa5 as a risk factor for recurrent pregnancy loss (rpl).   design case-control study.   setting academic research center.   patient(s) couples presenting themselves to the fertility center, ludwig-maximilians-university munich with two or more consecutive, unexplained miscarriages were selected for this study. fertile female controls were from the same center and also from the resource of the institute of human genetics, westfalian wilhelms-university muenster. population controls were drafted from the popgen biobank, university clinic schleswig-holstein kiel.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) incidence of m2 carriage was estimated in patient and control groups, odds ratios were calculated, and rpl risk was evaluated.   result(s) in comparison with female fertile controls, the risk for repeated abortion in the rpl group, associated with m2 carriage, was between 1.7 and 3.8, and it was 2.3 compared with population controls. because of the equal genetic incidence of m2, with an allelic frequency of 0.167 in the female and male partner rpl subgroups, the haplotype confers approximately the same relative risk to carriers of both sexes.   conclusion(s) paternal m2 carriage seems to confer an equal risk for recurrent miscarriages as m2 carriage in rpl mothers. this finding points to a role of anxa5 and the m2 haplotype in the fetus and/or the extraembryonic membranes for pregnancy pathology. prognostic rpl algorithms might be improved by testing the male partner for m2 carriage, and this may guide adequate therapeutic decisions.
effects of paternal age and cigarette smoking on human semen parameters : a retrospective study on infertile couples milat the study examined the epidemiology and causes of infertility in tomsk, western siberia, using methodological approaches recommended by who and was based on the findings for a randomly selected sample of 2000 married women aged 18-45 years. among the respondents, 333 couples were considered infertile since they had not conceived after 12 months or more of unprotected intercourse. this group of infertile couples was offered comprehensive clinical investigations but only 186 couples completed them. the infertility rate in tomsk was 16.7%, being caused by diseases of the female reproduction system in 52.7% of the couples and by male reproductive diseases in 6.4%. in 38.7% of couples, both spouses suffered from infertility, while in 2.2% of cases the cause of infertility was not determined. among the causes of female infertility, secondary infertility dominated (12.9% of all the women questioned), while primary infertility affected 3.8% of the women. the most frequent causes of female infertility were disturbances to tubal patency (36.5%) and pelvic adhesions (23.6%). endocrine pathology was found in 32.8% of cases. the most frequent cause of male infertility was inflammatory disease of male accessory glands (12.9%). in 8.6% of cases infection resulted in obstructive azoospermia. varicocele was registered in 11.3% of cases, and idiopathic pathospermia in 20.9%. inflammatory complications among females were 4.2 times more frequent than among males.
genome-wide association analysis of oxidative stress resistance in drosophila melanogaster backgroundduring their life, multicellular organisms are challenged with oxidative stress. it is generated by several reactive oxygen species (ros), may limit lifespan and has been related to several human diseases. ros can generate a wide variety of defects in many cellular components and thus the response of the organism challenged with oxidative stress may share some features with other stress responses. conversely, in spite of recent progress, a complete functional analysis of the transcriptional responses to different oxidative stresses in model organisms is still missing. in addition, the functional significance of observed transcriptional changes is still elusive.resultswe used oligonucleotide microarrays to address the specificities of transcriptional responses of adult drosophila to different stresses induced by paraquat and h2o2, two oxidative stressors, and by tunicamycin which induces an endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress. both specific and common responses to the three stressors were observed and whole genome functional analysis identified several important classes of stress responsive genes. within some functional classes, we observed that isozymes do not all behave similarly, which may reflect unsuspected functional specificities. moreover, genetic experiments performed on a subset of lines bearing mutations in genes identified in microarray experiments showed that a significant number of these mutations may affect resistance of adult drosophila to oxidative stress.conclusionsa long term common stress response to paraquat- or h2o2-induced oxidative stresses and er stress is observed for a significant number of genes. besides this common response, the unexpected complexity of the stress responses to oxidative and er stresses in drosophila, suggest significant specificities in protective properties between genes associated to the same functional classes. according to our functional analysis, a large part of the genome may play a role in protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in drosophila.
benzo(a)pyrene exposure causes genotoxic and biochemical changes in the midge larvae of chironomus sancticaroli strixino & strixino (diptera: chironomidae) the toxicological evaluations of crude oil, xylene, toluene and benzene were carried out against juvenile stages of clarias gariepinus. on the basis of lc50 value, benzene (0.017 ml/l) was found to be the most toxic followed by xylene (0.086 ml/l), toluene (0.398 ml/l) and crude oil (2.219 ml/l) was the least toxic. the results of the lipid peroxidation assay showed that the level of malonaldehyde (mda) in liver and gills of fish exposed to all the test chemicals increased significantly (p < 0.05) when compared to control. measurement of activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat) and glutathione-s-transferase (gst) in liver and gill of fishes exposed to sublethal concentration of the test chemicals over a 28-day period was found to decrease significantly (p < 0.05) when compared to control. the observed reduction in the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes such as sod, cat and gst in conjunction with an increase in mda levels in the gill and liver tissues of test animals exposed to aromatic hydrocarbon compounds were recommended as a good battery of biomarkers for early detection of pollution during biomonitoring programmes.
cytr homolog of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum controls air-liquid biofilm formation by regulating multiple genes involved in cellulose production, c-di-gmp signaling, motility, and type iii secretion system in response to nutritional and environmental signals cyclic diguanylate (c‐di‐gmp) is a second messenger implicated in the regulation of various cellular properties in several bacterial species. however, its function in phytopathogenic bacteria is not yet understood. in this study we investigated a panel of ggdef/eal domain proteins which have the potential to regulate c‐di‐gmp levels in the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii 3937. two proteins, ecpb (contains ggdef and eal domains) and ecpc (contains an eal domain) were shown to regulate multiple cellular behaviours and virulence gene expression. deletion of ecpb and/or ecpc enhanced biofilm formation but repressed swimming/swarming motility. in addition, the ecpb and ecpc mutants displayed a significant reduction in pectate lyase production, a virulence factor of this bacterium. gene expression analysis showed that deletion of ecpb and ecpc significantly reduced expression of the type iii secretion system (t3ss) and its virulence effector proteins. expression of the t3ss genes is regulated by hrpl and possibly rpon, two alternative sigma factors. in vitro biochemical assays showed that ecpc has phosphodiesterase activity to hydrolyse c‐di‐gmp into linear pgpg. most of the enterobacterial pathogens encode at least one t3ss, a major virulence factor which functions to subvert host defences. the current study broadens our understanding of the interplay between c‐di‐gmp, rpon and t3ss and the potential role of c‐di‐gmp in t3ss regulation among a wide range of bacterial pathogens.
biomedical factors associated with hospitalization of older adults: the bambuí health and aging study (bhas). background the aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the paisley-renfrew midspan cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions.   method a cohort analysis was carried out in paisley and renfrew, two post-industrial towns in west central scotland. this used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. the subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. the main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors).   results the following patterns of hospital utilization were found. only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). in contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. the age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). for non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. analysis of risk factors (using cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (fev1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors.   conclusions despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. the absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low fev1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates.
reading faces for information about words and emotions in adolescents with autism. this study examined differences in the ability to decode emotion through facial expression, prosody, and verbal content between 14 children with asperger’s syndrome (as) and 16 typically developing peers. the ability to decode emotion was measured by the perception of emotion test (poet), which portrayed the emotions of happy, angry, sad, and neutral among the modalities of static and dynamic facial expression, prosody, verbal content, and all modalities combined. results revealed that children with as had more difficulty identifying emotions through static facial expression, dynamic facial expression, and prosody than typically developing children. results are discussed in relationship to an over-reliance on verbal content as a compensatory strategy in social interactions. treatment implications for individuals with as are also discussed.
pre-ischemic treadmill training alleviates brain damage via glt-1-mediated signal pathway after ischemic stroke in rats previous studies have implicated phospholipase c (plc)-linked group i metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) in regulating the excitability of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons. we used intracellular recordings from rat hippocampal slices and specific antagonists to examine in more detail the mglur receptor subtypes and signal transduction mechanisms underlying this effect. application of the group i mglur agonist (rs)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (dhpg) suppressed slow- and medium-duration afterhyperpolarizations (s- and mahp) and caused a consequent increase in cell excitability as well as a depolarization of the membrane and an increase in input resistance. interestingly, with the exception of the suppression of the mahp, these effects were persistent, and in the case of the sahp lasting for more than 1 h of drug washout. preincubation with the specific mglur5 antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (mpep), reduced but did not completely prevent the effects of dhpg. however, preincubation with both mpep and the mglur1 antagonist ly367385 completely prevented the dhpg-induced changes. these results demonstrate that the dhpg-induced changes are mediated partly by mglur5 and partly by mglur1. because group i mglurs are linked to plc via g-protein activation, we also investigated pathways downstream of plc activation, using chelerythrine and cyclopiazonic acid to block protein kinase c (pkc) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-(ip(3))-activated ca(2+) stores, respectively. neither inhibitor affected the dhpg-induced suppression of the sahp or the increase in excitability nor did an inhibitor of plc itself, u-73122. taken together, these results argue that in ca1 pyramidal cells in the adult rat, dhpg activates mglurs of both the mglur5 and mglur1 subtypes, causing a long-lasting suppression of the sahp and a consequent persistent increase in excitability via a plc-, pkc-, and ip(3)-independent transduction pathway.
dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex in response to memantine following sub-chronic nmda receptor blockade with memantine: a microdialysis study in rats we have examined the effects of schizophrenomimetic drugs including phencyclidine (pcp) and methamphetamine (map) on cortical and striatal dopamine (da) metabolism using an in vivo dialysis technique in the rat. an acute systemic injection of pcp (2.5–10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) dramatically increased concentrations of da, 3,4‐dihydroxy‐phenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in the dialysates from the medial frontal cortex in a dose‐dependent fashion. however, pcp (2.5–10 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a much lower augmentation of extracellular da release, with a significant decrease in dialysate dopac levels in the striatum. moreover, continuous infusion of tetrodotoxin (ttx, 10−5 m) into the prefrontal or striatal region through the microdialysis tube completely blocked the ability of pcp (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to alter the extracellular release of da and its metabolites in the respective areas. in contrast, map (4.8 mg/kg, i.p.) elicited a marked and tetrodotoxin‐resistant increase in da levels with a significant loss of dopac contents in the extracellular space of both the frontal cortex and the striatum. the present results clearly demonstrate the differential effects of pcp on cortical and striatal da transmission, suggesting that pcp may facilitate da release in the medial frontal cortex by increasing impulse flow in the da neurons projecting to the cortical area, whereas pcp‐induced elevation of extracellular da in the striatum may be caused mainly by reuptake inhibition of da liberated by basal activity of the striatal da neurons. the regional variation in pcp‐induced da release would be due to the combination of nmda (n‐methyl‐d‐aspartate) receptor blocking and da reuptake inhibition by the drug. the uniform and ttx‐resistant nature of map‐induced changes in brain da metabolism may result from the direct actions of map at da nerve terminals. © 1996 wiley‐liss, inc.
human ipsc-derived endothelial cell sprouting assay in synthetic hydrogel arrays. angiogenesis assays are an important tool for studying both the mechanisms of angiogenesis and the potential development of therapeutic strategies to modulate neovascularisation. in vivo angiogenesis assays are considered to be the most informative of these but are often expensive, time-consuming and require specialist training to perform. in vitro assays tend to be more rapid, less expensive and easier to interpret. in vitro angiogenesis assays operate on the principle that endothelial cells form tubule-like structures when cultured on a supportive matrix. assays involving a matrix derived from murine tumours, matrigel (or a growth factor reduced form of this), are now the most common in vitro tubule formation assays. however, another tubule formation assay has recently been developed in which endothelial cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts. here, we have used quantitative image analysis to compare the morphological features of tubules formed in the matrigel assay and this new ‘co-culture’ assay, with those of capillaries formed in a microvascular bed in vivo. tubules formed in standard and growth factor reduced matrigel assays were short and relatively homogeneous, whereas those formed in the co-culture assay were significantly more heterogeneous, consisting of both short and long interconnecting tubules that more closely resembled capillaries than matrigel tubules. moreover, cells on matrigel, and to a lesser extent growth factor reduced (gfr) matrigel, often clumped into large cell aggregates, a feature rarely seen in the co-culture assay. in addition, we demonstrate that matrigel stimulates tubule formation by various non-endothelial cell types, suggesting that tubule formation by endothelial cells may not represent true differentiation of this cell type. in summary, the morphology of tubules in the co-culture assay appears more representative of capillary formation in vivo, than the endothelial cell changes that occur in either form of matrigel assay.
cyclosporin a disrupts notch signaling and vascular lumen maintenance the notch and calcineurin/nfat pathways have both been implicated in control of keratinocyte differentiation. induction of the p21(waf1/cip1) gene by notch 1 activation in differentiating keratinocytes is associated with direct targeting of the rbp-jkappa protein to the p21 promoter. we show here that notch 1 activation functions also through a second calcineurin-dependent mechanism acting on the p21 tata box-proximal region. increased calcineurin/nfat activity by notch signaling involves downregulation of calcipressin, an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor, through a hes-1-dependent mechanism. besides control of the p21 gene, calcineurin contributes significantly to the transcriptional response of keratinocytes to notch 1 activation, both in vitro and in vivo. in fact, deletion of the calcineurin b1 gene in the skin results in a cyclic alopecia phenotype, associated with altered expression of notch-responsive genes involved in hair follicle structure and/or adhesion to the surrounding mesenchyme. thus, an important interconnection exists between notch 1 and calcineurin-nfat pathways in keratinocyte growth/differentiation control.
on some sufficient conditions for distributed quality-of-service support in wireless networks the capacity of an arbitrary ad-hoc network is difficult to estimate due to interference between the links. we use a conflict graph that models this interference relationship to determine if a set of flow rates can be accommodated. using the cliques (complete subgraphs) of the conflict graph, we derive constraints that are sufficient for a set of flow rates to be feasible, yet are guaranteed to be within a constant bound of the optimal. we also compute an alternate set of sufficient constraints that can be easily derived from the rows of the matrix representation of the conflict graph. these two sets of constraints are particularly useful because their construction and verification may be distributed across the nodes of a network. we also extend the ad-hoc network model to incorporate variations in the interference range, and obstructions in the network.
arsenic trioxide inhibits growth of as4.1 juxtaglomerular cells via cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent apoptosis. low concentrations of as(2)o(3) (</=1 micromol/l) induce long-lasting remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl) without significant myelosuppressive side effects. several groups, including ours, have shown that 0.5 to 1 micromol/l as(2)o(3) induces apoptosis in apl-derived nb4 cells, whereas other leukemic cells are resistant to as(2)o(3) or undergo apoptosis only in response to greater than 2 micromol/l as(2)o(3). in this report, we show that the ability of as(2)o(3) to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells is dependent on the activity of the enzymes that regulate cellular h(2)o(2) content. thus, nb4 cells have relatively low levels of glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and catalase and have a constitutively higher h(2)o(2) content than u937 monocytic leukemia cells. glutathione-s-transferase pi (gstpi), which is important for cellular efflux of as(2)o(3), is also low in nb4 cells. moreover, as(2)o(3) further inhibits gpx activity and increases cellular h(2)o(2) content in nb4 but not in u937 cells. selenite pretreatment of nb4 cells increases the activity of gpx, lowers cellular h(2)o(2) levels, and renders nb4 cells resistant to 1 micromol/l as(2)o(3). in contrast, concentrations of as(2)o(3) that alone are not capable of inducing apoptosis in nb4 cells induce apoptosis in the presence of the gpx inhibitor mercaptosuccinic acid. similar effects are observed by modulating the activity of catalase with its inhibitor, aminotriazol. more important from a therapeutic point of view, u937 and hl-60 cells, which require high concentrations of as(2)o(3) to undergo apoptosis, become sensitive to low, clinically acceptable concentrations of as(2)o(3) when cotreated with these gpx and catalase inhibitors. the induction of apoptosis by as(2)o(3) involves an early decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in h(2)o(2) content, followed by cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, dna fragmentation, and the classic morphologic changes of apoptosis.
parents' attitudes and behaviours towards recommended vaccinations in sicily, italy background the rate of nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements has been increasing, and children with exemptions have contributed to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.   objectives to determine why parents claim nonmedical exemptions and to explore differences in perceptions of vaccines and vaccine information sources between parents of exempt and fully vaccinated children.   design case-control study.   setting colorado, massachusetts, missouri, and washington.   participants surveys were mailed to the parents of 815 exempt children (cases) and 1630 fully vaccinated children (controls randomly selected from the same grade and school) recruited from 112 private and public elementary schools. surveys were completed by 2435 parents (56.1%).   main outcome measures parental reports.   results most children (209 [75.5%] of 277) with nonmedical exemptions received at least some vaccines. the most common vaccine not received was varicella (147 [53.1%] of 277 exempt children). the most common reason stated for requesting exemptions (190 [69%] of 277) was concern that the vaccines might cause harm. parents of exempt children were significantly more likely than parents of vaccinated children to report low perceived vaccine safety and efficacy, a low level of trust in the government, and low perceived susceptibility to and severity of vaccine-preventable diseases. parents of exempt children were significantly less likely to report confidence in medical, public health, and government sources for vaccine information and were more likely to report confidence in alternative medicine professionals than parents of vaccinated children.   conclusion continued efforts must be made to educate parents about the utility and safety of vaccines, especially parents requesting nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements.
viral superinfection in previously unrecognized chronic carriers of hepatitis b virus with superimposed acute fulminant versus nonfulminant hepatitis one hundred and thirty-four healthy subjects and 220 patients with liver diseases were studied for antibody to hepatitis a virus (anti-hav) with radio-immunoassay. the frequency of anti-hav related closely to the age of healthy subjects; the rate of positivity increased with age, being 5.9% in those under four years, 13.3% in the late first decade and over 90% after the third decade. taking meals at stalls with poor sanitary standards is suspected to cause the prevailing infection in teenagers, although a cohort effect due to environmental and socio-economic improvement can not be excluded. anti-hav was present in most patients with frequencies comparable to healthy subjects of the same age. it is concluded that in taiwan the prevalent chronic liver diseases and hepatocarcinoma are unrelated to hav infection and the patients are infected to an extent similar to healthy people of the same age.
sep-nets: small and effective pattern networks the explosion of image data on the internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. but exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. we introduce here a new database called “imagenet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the wordnet structure. imagenet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of wordnet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. this will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of wordnet. this paper offers a detailed analysis of imagenet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. we show that imagenet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. we describe the data collection scheme with amazon mechanical turk. lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of imagenet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. we hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of imagenet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.
peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha induction of uncoupling protein 2 protects against acetaminophen‐induced liver toxicity metabolic bioactivation, glutathione depletion, and covalent binding are the early hallmark events after acetaminophen (apap) overdose. however, the subsequent metabolic consequences contributing to apap-induced hepatic necrosis and apoptosis have not been fully elucidated. in this study, serum metabolomes of control and apap-treated wild-type and cyp2e1-null mice were examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) and multivariate data analysis. a dose-response study showed that the accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines in serum contributes to the separation of wild-type mice undergoing apap-induced hepatotoxicity from other mouse groups in a multivariate model. this observation, in conjunction with the increase of triglycerides and free fatty acids in the serum of apap-treated wild-type mice, suggested that apap treatment can disrupt fatty acid beta-oxidation. a time-course study further indicated that both wild-type and cyp2e1-null mice had their serum acylcarnitine levels markedly elevated within the early hours of apap treatment. while remaining high in wild-type mice, serum acylcarnitine levels gradually returned to normal in cyp2e1-null mice at the end of the 24 h treatment. distinct from serum aminotransferase activity and hepatic glutathione levels, the pattern of serum acylcarnitine accumulation suggested that acylcarnitines can function as complementary biomarkers for monitoring the apap-induced hepatotoxicity. an essential role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (pparalpha) in the regulation of serum acylcarnitine levels was established by comparing the metabolomic responses of wild-type and ppara-null mice to a fasting challenge. the upregulation of pparalpha activity following apap treatment was transient in wild-type mice but was much more prolonged in cyp2e1-null mice. overall, serum metabolomics of apap-induced hepatotoxicity revealed that the cyp2e1-mediated metabolic activation and oxidative stress following apap treatment can cause irreversible inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, potentially through suppression of pparalpha-regulated pathways.
decreased mir-503 expression in gastric cancer is inversely correlated with serum carcinoembryonic antigen and acts as a potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarker epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt) is believed to be associated with cancer cell malignancy, and also to cause cancer invasion and metastasis. recent evidence indicates that small non-protein coding rna [micrornas (mirnas/mirs)] may act as powerful regulators of emt. the present study aimed to systematically delineate mir-503 expression in gastric cancer and analyse the function of mir-503 in gastric cancer emt. in the present study, mir-503 expression was detected in gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. gastric cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation capabilities were analysed by transwell, mtt and clonability assays. the expression of mesenchymal markers, including fibronectin, vimentin, n-cadherin, snail and the epithelial marker, e-cadherin, was examined by immunoblot analysis following mir-503 transfection. mir-503 expression was found to be reduced in gastric cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric mucosa cell lines, and the expression of mir-503 was upregulated in non-metastatic-derived gastric cancer cell lines compared with metastatic-derived lines. mir-503 expression levels were significantly reduced in tumour tissues in comparison with adjacent normal mucosa tissues, and the mir-503 expression levels in patients with metastases were significantly lower than those in patients without. mir-503 inhibited gastric cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation. fibronectin, vimentin, n-cadherin and snail protein levels were decreased, but e-cadherin expression was increased in an ags cell line transfected with mir-503. taken together, the present findings indicate that mir-503 acts as a novel tumour suppressor gene in gastric cancer and can inhibit emt in gastric cancer cells.
plasma homocysteine in schizophrenia: determinants and clinical correlations in tunisian patients free from antipsychotics background an increased risk of both schizophrenia and neural tube defects was observed in a birth cohort exposed to famine during early gestation. neural tube defects have been related to a folate-sensitive genetic defect in homocysteine metabolism. if this were also true for schizophrenia, then cases with low folate (lf)--and only these cases--should have increased homocysteine levels compared with controls.   methods we compared homocysteine levels of schizophrenia cases and normal controls with low folate (lf) and without low folate (non-lf). low folate was defined by the bottom tertile for controls.   results in the lf group (6 cases, 8 controls), mean homocysteine was 10.7 microm in cases compared with 7.7 microm in controls (p = .03). in the non-lf group (11 cases, 16 controls) mean homocysteine did not differ for cases and controls.   conclusions these pilot data are compatible with the hypothesis that a folate-sensitive defect in homocysteine metabolism contributes to cases of schizophrenia.
correlation of leptinemia with components of metabolic syndrome in moroccan youths: influence of obesity, blood pressure, gender and stage of puberty we studied serum leptin levels in 189 healthy children to evaluate related factors during childhood and adolescence. leptin correlated with body mass index (bmi), triceps skinfold thickness (p<0.001) and body weight (p<0.01). obese children and girls had higher leptin levels than non-obese children and boys, respectively (p<0.001). in girls, leptin correlated positively with age, skinfold thickness and bmi (p<0.001). in boys, leptin correlated negatively with age (p<0.001) and positively with skinfold thickness (p<0.05). prepubertal boys had higher leptin levels than prepubertal girls and pubertal boys (p<0.05). pubertal girls had higher leptin levels than prepubertal girls and pubertal boys (p<0.001). leptin levels in girls were higher at tanner stages 4 and 5 than at stage 1 (p<0.001). in conclusion, serum leptin levels are related with adiposity, have obviously age-related gender differences during childhood and adolescence, and may be involved in the maturation of reproductive capacity.

dental age in patients with impacted maxillary canines related to the position of the impacted teeth. an etiologic connection between palatally ectopic canines and small and missing teeth is well established in the literature. additionally, it has been observed that patients with palatally ectopic canines have a delayed dental development. the present study was designed to examine the validity of this latter observation. we radiographically assessed the subjects' dental ages using criteria of tooth calcification, rather than tooth eruption pattern. a similar determination was made in relation to subjects in whom buccally ectopic canines were present. the experimental group consisted of panoramic radiographs of 55 consecutively treated patients with palatally displaced maxillary canines and of 47 consecutively treated patients with buccally displaced canines. they were compared with a control group of 57 consecutively treated patients with normally placed canines. approximately half the subjects with palatal displacement exhibited a late-developing dentition, whereas the timing of dentition in the remaining subjects appeared to be normal. buccal displacement was not associated with a retarded dental development, and the ranges of the dental age values were similar to those seen in the control group. the results support the idea that there are different etiologies for the occurrence of buccal versus palatal ectopia in maxillary canines. they also suggest that dentitions with a palatal canine appear to be of 2 distinct varieties, with different dental characteristics and, perhaps, different etiologies.
learning random kernel approximations for object recognition recent advances in multiple kernel learning (mkl) have positioned it as an attractive tool for tackling many supervised learning tasks. the development of efficient gradient descent based optimization schemes has made it possible to tackle large scale problems. simultaneously, mkl based algorithms have achieved very good results on challenging real world applications. yet, despite their successes, mkl approaches are limited in that they focus on learning a linear combination of given base kernels.  in this paper, we observe that existing mkl formulations can be extended to learn general kernel combinations subject to general regularization. this can be achieved while retaining all the efficiency of existing large scale optimization algorithms. to highlight the advantages of generalized kernel learning, we tackle feature selection problems on benchmark vision and uci databases. it is demonstrated that the proposed formulation can lead to better results not only as compared to traditional mkl but also as compared to state-of-the-art wrapper and filter methods for feature selection.
rotating objects to recognize them: a case study on the role of viewpoint dependency in the recognition of three-dimensional objects this study examined two related phenomena: (a) the judgment of whether a human body part belongs to the left or right half of the body and (b) the imagined spatial transformation of one's body. in three experiments, observers made left-right judgments of a part of a body whose orientation differed from their own by a rotation about one of 13 axes. to do so, they imagined themselves passing to the orientation of the stimulus. time for (a) left-right judgments and (b) accompanying imagined spatial transformations depended on the extent of the orientation difference (od) between the observer and stimulus. more important, time for phenomena (a) and (b) depended strongly, and in the same way, on the direction of od. further results showed that the rate of imagined spatial transformations can vary strongly for different axes and directions of rotation about an axis. these and other results (e.g., parsons, 1987a) suggest that temporal and kinematic properties of imagined spatial transformations are more object-specific than could be previously assumed.
molecular characterization of ribonucleoproteic antigens containing repeated amino acid sequences from trypanosoma cruzi. the human ribosomal protein l7a is a component of the major ribosomal subunit. we transiently expressed in hela cells l7a-β-galactosidase fusion proteins and studied their subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti-β-galactosidase antibodies. we have identified three distinct domains responsible for the nuclear targeting of the protein: domain i, amino acids 23-51; domain ii, amino acids 52-100; domain iii, amino acids 101-220, each of which contains at least one nuclear localization signal (nls). through subcellular localization analysis of deletion mutants of l7a-β-galactosidase chimeras, we demonstrate that domain ii plays a special role because it is necessary, although not sufficient, to target the chimeric β-galactosidase to the nucleoli. in fact, we demonstrate that the nucleolar targeting process requires the presence of domain ii plus an additional basic domain that can be represented by an nls or a basic stretch of amino acids without nls activity. thus, when multiple nls are present, each nls exerts distinct functions. domain ii drives nucleolar accumulation of a reporter protein with the cooperative action of a short basic amino acid sequence, suggesting a mechanism requiring protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions.
number of aberrant crypt foci associated with adiposity and igf1 bioavailability there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. the phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. this review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. the genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. these include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. a number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. these pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
p-selectin contributes to severe experimental malaria but is not required for leukocyte adhesion to brain microvasculature we determined the requirement for selected lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in the pathogenesis of experimental murine cerebral malaria (cm) by using gene-targeted knockout and mab-suppressed mice. plasmodium berghei anka infection induced cm in a 0/0 mice, which lack expression of surface mhc class ii glycoproteins and consequently express a severe and chronic reduction in numbers of cd4+ t cells. however, when a 0/0 mice, which are on a c57bl/6 x 129 genetic background, or immune-intact c57bl/6 controls treated with anti-cd4 mab were infected, none developed cm. the latter finding confirms an earlier report that cd4+ t cells are required for cm to occur and additionally indicates that the reduced numbers of cd4+ t cells present in a 0/0 mice are sufficient for cm development. neither the recently described cd4+, nk1.1+ t cell subset shown to be present in a 0/0 mice nor traditional nk cells seem to be required for the induction of cm because a 0/0 and c57bl/6 mice severely depleted of both nk1.1+ populations with mab developed cm as readily as did normal ig-treated controls. deficiency of th1-associated cytokines (ifn-gamma or il-2) in mice by gene-targeted disruptions completely inhibited cm development, whereas the lack of th2-associated cytokines (il-4 or il-10) did not prevent this disease. our observation that b cell-deficient jhd and micromt mice developed cm provides evidence that neither b cells, their products, nor b cell ag presentation are a requisite for cm pathology. we further observed that neither beta 2m 0/0 knockout mice, which lack cd8+ alpha beta t cells, nor c57bl/6 mice depleted of cd8+ t cells with anti-cd8 mab treatment developed cm, leading us to conclude that cd8+ t cells are also crucial for the development of cm.
surgical outcome of a repeat midurethral sling procedure after failure of a first procedure background data about the use of tension-free vaginal tape (tvt) in the management of recurrent urodynamic stress incontinence (rusi) after previous failed midurethral sling procedure (musp) are limited.   objective assessment of the efficacy and the indications of the tvt procedure in the management of patients with rusi after failed previous musp.   design, setting, and participants thirty-one patients with rusi after previous failed musp were prospectively enrolled at a single tertiary academic center.   measurements preoperatively and postoperatively, patients were assessed with physical examination, urinalysis, urine culture, bladder diary for 2-3 d, q-tip test, uroflow, filling and voiding cystometry, urethral profilometry, and 1-h pad test. mean follow-up was at 18.6 mo (range: 12-28 mo).   results and limitations overall, the objective cure rate based on the pad test findings was 74%, the improvement rate was 6.5%, and the failure rate was 19.5%. the objective cure rate based on cough stress test during filling cystometry was 77.4%, and the subjective cure rate based on patients' answers was 71%. the study could have some limitations. the relatively small number of patients enrolled could affect the findings of study to some degree. additionally, because urethral pressure profiles show a significant degree of directional dependence when side-hole microtip transducers are used, as in the present study, the orientation of the transducer could affect the values measured.   conclusions the tvt procedure as a second operation could provide an overall cure rate of 74% with a low complication rate in female patients with rusi after previous failed midurethral tape procedures.
6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to a peak-interval procedure highlights ► the effect of timing behaviour on cortical and striatal fos expression was examined. ► rats trained on the peak procedure (fipp) and a control schedule were compared. ► fos expression in the orbital pfc was enhanced following exposure to the fipp. ► fos expression in the striatum did not differ between rats trained on the two tasks. ► the results suggest that the orbital pfc is involved in interval timing behaviour.
effect of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on infant neurodevelopment at 1 year of age. context thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development. limited data are available regarding whether thyroid function in neonates influences later cognitive development.   objective our objective was to study associations of newborn t4 levels with maternal thyroid function and childhood cognition.   design and setting we studied participants in project viva, a cohort study in massachusetts.   participants we studied a total of 500 children born 1999--2003 at 34 wk or more.   main outcome measures we determined cognitive test scores at ages 6 months and 3 yr.   results mean newborn t4 at a mean age of 1.94 d was 17.6 (sd 4.0) microg/dl, and levels were higher in girls [1.07 microg/dl; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.38, 1.76] and infants born after longer gestation (0.42 microg/dl; 95% ci 0.17, 0.67 per wk). newborn t4 levels were not associated with maternal t4, tsh, or thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. on multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, higher newborn t4 was unexpectedly associated with poorer scores on the visual recognition memory test among infants at age 6 months (-0.5; 95% ci -0.9, -0.2), but not with scores at age 3 yr on either the peabody picture vocabulary test (0.2; 95% ci -0.1, 0.5) or the wide range assessment of visual motor abilities (0.1; 95% ci -0.2, 0.3). maternal thyroid function test results were not associated with child cognitive test scores.   conclusions newborn t4 concentrations within a normal physiological reference range are not associated with maternal thyroid function and do not predict cognitive outcome in a population living in an iodine-sufficient area.
urinary albumin and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine as markers of mortality and cardiovascular disease during 19 years after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes – a comparative study of two markers to identify high risk patients background—for the general population, the clinical relevance of an increased urinary albumin excretion rate is still debated. therefore, we examined the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and all-cause mortality and mortality caused by cardiovascular (cv) disease and non-cv disease in the general population. methods and results—in the period 1997 to 1998, all inhabitants of the city of groningen, the netherlands, aged between 28 and 75 years (n=85 421) were sent a postal questionnaire collecting information about risk factors for cv disease and cv morbidity and a vial to collect an early morning urine sample for measurement of urinary albumin concentration (uac). the vital status of the cohort was subsequently obtained from the municipal register, and the cause of death was obtained from the central bureau of statistics. of these 85 421 subjects, 40 856 (47.8%) responded, and 40 548 could be included in the analysis. during a median follow-up period of 961 days (maximum 1139 days), 516 deaths with known cause were recorded. we found a positive dose-response relationship between increasing uac and mortality. a higher uac increased the risk of both cv and non-cv death after adjustment for other well-recognized cv risk factors, with the increase being significantly higher for cv mortality than for non-cv mortality (p =0.014). a 2-fold increase in uac was associated with a relative risk of 1.29 for cv mortality (95% ci 1.18 to 1.40) and 1.12 (95% ci 1.04 to 1.21) for non-cv mortality. conclusions—urinary albumin excretion is a predictor of all-cause mortality in the general population. the excess risk was more attributable to death from cv causes, independent of the effects of other cv risk factors, and the relationship was already apparent at levels of albuminuria currently considered to be normal.
risk of subsequent gastrointestinal cancer among childhood cancer survivors: a systematic review. background although elevated risks of pancreatic cancer have been observed in long-term survivors of hodgkin lymphoma (hl), no prior study has assessed the risk of second pancreatic cancer in relation to radiation dose and specific chemotherapeutic agents.   patients and methods we conducted an international case-control study within a cohort of 19 882 hl survivors diagnosed from 1953 to 2003 including 36 cases and 70 matched controls.   results median ages at hl and pancreatic cancer diagnoses were 47 and 60.5 years, respectively; median time to pancreatic cancer was 19 years. pancreatic cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose to the pancreatic tumor location (ptrend = 0.005) and increasing number of alkylating agent (aa)-containing cycles of chemotherapy (ptrend = 0.008). the odds ratio (or) for patients treated with both subdiaphragmatic radiation (≥10 gy) and ≥6 aa-containing chemotherapy cycles (13 cases, 6 controls) compared with patients with neither treatment was 17.9 (95% confidence interval 3.5-158). the joint effect of these two treatments was significantly greater than additive (p = 0.041) and nonsignificantly greater than multiplicative (p = 0.29). especially high risks were observed among patients receiving ≥8400 mg/m(2) of procarbazine with nitrogen mustard or ≥3900 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide.   conclusion our study demonstrates for the first time that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy substantially increase pancreatic cancer risks among hl survivors treated in the past. these findings extend the range of nonhematologic cancers associated with chemotherapy and add to the evidence that the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can lead to especially large risks.
morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae in children born with non-syndromic cleft lip and / or palate compared with children without cleft objective: to investigate anatomical variations and abnormalities of cervical spine morphology in unoperated infants with cleft lip and palate. design: retrospective cross-sectional investigation of infants born with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate using computed tomography scans acquired for investigation of a spectrum of clinical conditions. setting: computed tomography scan data were obtained from 29 unoperated cleft lip and palate infants and 12 noncleft infants of malay origin, ages 0 to 12 months. methods: observational study of cervical spine computed tomography scans. heights of cervical vertebral bodies (c2-c7) and intervertebral spaces were measured from landmarks identified from computed tomography reformats and three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions. linear modeling of heights and spaces, with age as a covariate, was undertaken to identify differences between the samples. results: anomalous features observed in the cleft lip and palate sample included short posterior arch of c1 (2/29), abnormal development of the anterior arch of c1 (2/29), and fusions of the posterior arch of c2 and c3 (2/29). no anomalies of the cervical spine were observed in the noncleft sample. although the heights of three cervical vertebral bodies were significantly smaller and two intervertebral spaces were significantly larger in infants with cleft lip and palate compared with noncleft infants (p < .05), overall length of the cervical spine did not differ significantly between the samples. conclusion: there was evidence for subtle upper spinal anomalies in the infant cleft lip and palate population. our finding of reduced size of some cervical vertebral bodies may reflect delayed upper spinal development in infants with cleft lip and palate.
stroke with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: a descriptive population-based study from the brest stroke registry background: prospective population-based studies are important to accurately determine the incidence and characteristics of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (af), while avoiding selection bias which may complicate hospital-based studies. methods: we investigated af-associated stroke within the north dublin population stroke study, a prospective cohort study of stroke/transient ischaemic attack in 294,592 individuals, according to recommended criteria for rigorous stroke epidemiological studies. results: of 568 stroke patients ascertained in the first year, 31.2% (177/568) were associated with af (90.4%, i.e. 160/177 ischaemic infarcts). the crude incidence rate of all af-associated stroke was 60/100,000 person-years (95% ci = 52–70). prior stroke was almost twice as common in af compared to non-af groups (21.9 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.01). the frequency of af progressively increased across ischaemic stroke patients stratified by increasing stroke severity (nihss 0–4, 29.7%; 5–9, 38.1%; 10–14, 43.8%; ≥15, 53.3%, p < 0.0001). the 90-day trajectory of recovery of af-associated stroke was identical to that of non-af stroke, but rankin scores in af stroke remained higher at 7, 28 and 90 days (p < 0.001 for all). discussion: af-associated stroke occurred in one third of all patients and was associated with a distinct profile of recurrent, severe and disabling stroke. targeted strategies to increase anticoagulation rates may provide a substantial benefit to prevent severe disabling stroke at a population level.
prevalence and risk factors for osteopenia/osteoporosis in an hiv-infected male population since the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy in combination regimens, multiple epidemiologic studies have shown that osteopenia and osteoporosis are common among patients with hiv infection. however, there remain many areas of uncertainty about this potential complication, which can be confusing for the hiv clinician. this review summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, suggested screening strategies, and management options of decreased bone mineral density in patients with hiv. our aims are to review the available data, highlight controversial issues, and provide guidance for clinicians where supporting data are unavailable.
influenza vaccination coverage rate for medical staff: influence of hospital-based vaccination campaign. backgroundannual influenza vaccination is recommended for healthcare workers (hcws) in order to reduce the morbidity associated with influenza in healthcare settings. the aim of this study was to evaluate the current vaccination status of the hcws in one of italy's largest multidisciplinary university hospitals.methodsbetween february 1 and march 31, 2006, we carried out a cross-sectional study of influenza vaccination coverage among hcws at the university hospital fondazione irccs "ospedale maggiore policlinico, mangiagalli e regina elena", milan, italy. after receiving a brief description of the aim of the study, 2,143 (95%: 1,064 physicians; 855 nurses; 224 paramedics) of 2,240 hcws self-completed an anonymous questionnaire.resultsinfluenza vaccination coverage was very low in all specialties, varying from 17.6% in the emergency department to 24.3% in the surgery department, and knowledge of influenza epidemiology and prevention was poor. the factors positively associated with being vaccinated were an age of ≥ 45 years, considering influenza a potentially severe disease, and being aware of the high-risk categories for which influenza vaccination is strongly recommended; those that negatively associated with being vaccinated were being female, working in the medicine department, and being a nurse or paramedic.conclusiondespite strong recommendations, influenza vaccination coverage seemed to be very low among hcws of all specialties, with differences between areas and types of employment. specific continuous educational and vaccination programs for different targets should be urgently organized to reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients, contain nosocomial outbreaks, and ensure an appropriate socioeconomic impact.
inhibition of the ras/raf/erk1/2 signaling pathway restores cultured spinal cord-injured neuronal migration, adhesion, and dendritic spine development atheroma formation involves the movement of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmc) into the subendothelial space. the aim of this study was to determine the involvement of pi3k and mapk pathways and the importance of cross-talk between these pathways, in glucose-potentiated vsmc chemotaxis to serum factors. vsmc chemotaxis occurred in a serum gradient in 25 mmol/l glucose (but not in 5 mmol/l glucose) in association with increased phosphorylation (activation) of akt and erk1/2 in pi3k and mapk pathways, respectively. inhibitors of these pathways blocked chemotaxis, as did an mtor inhibitor. vsmc expressed all class ia pi3k isoforms, but microinjection experiments demonstrated that only the p110&bgr; isoform was involved in chemotaxis. erk1/2 phosphorylation was reduced not only by mapk pathway inhibitors but also by pi3k and mtor inhibitors; when pi3k was inhibited, erk phosphorylation could be induced by microinjected activated akt, indicating important cross-talk between the pi3k and erk1/2 pathways. glucose-potentiated phosphorylation of molecules in the p38 and jnk mapk pathways inhibited these pathways but did not affect chemotaxis. the statin, mevinolin, blocked chemotaxis through its effects on the mapk pathway. mevinolin-inhibited chemotaxis was restored by farnesylpyrophosphate but not by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate; in the absence of mevinolin, inhibition of farnesyltransferase reduced erk phosphorylation and blocked chemotaxis, indicating a role for the ras family of gtpases (mapk pathway) under these conditions. in conclusion, glucose sensitizes vsmc to serum, inducing chemotaxis via pathways involving p110&bgr;-pi3k, akt, mtor, and erk1/2 mapk. cross-talk between the pi3k and mapk pathways is necessary for vsmc chemotaxis under these conditions.
acute antidepressant drug administration and autobiographical memory recall: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. autobiographical memory (am) entails a complex set of operations, including episodic memory, self-reflection, emotion, visual imagery, attention, executive functions, and semantic processes. the heterogeneous nature of am poses significant challenges in capturing its behavioral and neuroanatomical correlates. investigators have recently turned their attention to the functional neuroanatomy of am. we used the effect-location method of meta-analysis to analyze data from 24 functional imaging studies of am. the results indicated a core neural network of left-lateralized regions, including the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal, medial and lateral temporal and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortices, the temporoparietal junction and the cerebellum. secondary and tertiary regions, less frequently reported in imaging studies of am, are also identified. we examined the neural correlates of putative component processes in am, including, executive functions, self-reflection, episodic remembering and visuospatial processing. we also separately analyzed the effect of select variables on the am network across individual studies, including memory age, qualitative factors (personal significance, level of detail and vividness), semantic and emotional content, and the effect of reference conditions. we found that memory age effects on medial temporal lobe structures may be modulated by qualitative aspects of memory. studies using rest as a control task masked process-specific components of the am neural network. our findings support a neural distinction between episodic and semantic memory in am. finally, emotional events produced a shift in lateralization of the am network with activation observed in emotion-centered regions and deactivation (or lack of activation) observed in regions associated with cognitive processes.
insulin-like growth factor-i is necessary for neural stem cell proliferation and demonstrates distinct actions of epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 fibroblast growth factor stimulates proliferation and subsequent differentiation of precursor cells isolated from the neuroepithelium of embryonic day 10 mice in vitro. here we show that fibroblast growth factor-induced proliferation is dependent on the presence of insulin-like growth factors (igfs) and that igf-i is endogenously produced by the neuroepithelial cells. blocking of endogenous igf-i activity with anti-igf-i antibodies results in complete inhibition of fibroblast growth factor-mediated proliferation and in cell death. igf-i alone acts as a survival agent. these observations correlate with the detection of transcripts for igf-i and basic fibroblast growth factor in freshly isolated neuroepithelium and are consistent with an autocrine action of these factors in early brain development in vivo.
the importance of preoperative and postoperative physical activity counseling in bariatric surgery physical activity is a cornerstone in the medical management of obesity and could be important for weight loss following bariatric surgery. this review aims to describe the evolution of physical activity following massive weight loss induced by bariatric surgery, and to identify the relationship between physical activity and amount of weight loss. a literature search identified 20 publications (19 studies) reporting physical activity data in relation to bariatric surgery. all studies were observational. self‐assessment of physical activity was used in all the studies. objective measures (pedometry) were used in two studies. the time frame for physical activity assessment varied: before surgery in two publications, after surgery in nine, and longitudinal pre‐ to post‐operative evolution in nine. the latter nine publications found an increase in physical activity after bariatric surgery. in 10/13 studies where it was described, there was a positive relationship between physical activity level and amount of weight loss. in conclusion, observational evidence of self‐reported physical activity suggests that physical activity increases after bariatric surgery and that physical activity is associated with surgically induced weight loss. however, these findings warrant further evaluation using objective measures of physical activity and testing in controlled trials.
factors influencing the measurement of lysosomal enzymes activity in human cerebrospinal fluid the optimal assay conditions and the stability of the following enzymes of lysosomal origin in human cerebrospinal fluid (csf) were studied: acid phosphatase, beta-d-n-acetylglucosaminidase, alpha-d-galactosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, alpha-d-glucosidase, beta-d-glucosidase, alpha-l-fucosidase, alpha-d-mannosidase, beta-d-glucuronidase. the microsomal alpha-d-mannosidase, ph 5.7, was used as a reference non-lysosomal glycohydrolase. all the examined enzymes, with the only exception of beta-d-glucuronidase, underwent a more or less rapid loss of activity upon csf storage in the temperature range from 37 degrees c to -80 degrees c. storage in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees c) was the only condition in which full activity for all tested enzymes was maintained for at least 15 days. addition of human serum albumin to csf, immediately after withdrawal, had a double effect in favouring enzyme stabilization and causing enzyme activation in some cases, and enzyme inhibition in others. using conditions warranting enzyme stability the fluorimetric methods for lysosomal enzymes determination in cerebrospinal fluid appear to be highly reproducible (cv less than 5%) and simple enough for routine use.
correlation of plasma b-type natriuretic peptide with shunt volume in children with congenital heart disease involving left-to-right shunt. the goal of this study was to test the utility of bedside plasma concentration of b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) assay as a screen for large shunts in pediatric patients with atrial septal defects (asds) and ventricular septal defects (vsds). thirty-five children at a mean age of 70 ± 129 weeks with asd or vsd were included in the study. nine patients had vsd and 26 had asd. plasma bnp values were compared with the qp/qs ratios derived from quantitative doppler flow measurements. mean bnp was 29 ± 42 pg/ml, with a range between <5 pg/ml and 208 pg/ml. sixteen patients had qp/qs values >1.5 and 19 had values <1.5. the difference of mean bnp in these patient groups was statistically significant (45 ± 56 vs 14 ± 17, p = 0.03). bnp was positively correlated with shunt significance. receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 79% at a plasma bnp cut-off level of ≥20 pg/ml. bedside measurement of bnp correlates with magnitude of asd and vsd in children. bnp can provide information for the management of children with asd or vsd. it can be used as part of the evaluation of a child with a preliminary diagnosis of a congenital defect.
evolutionary and functional analysis of old world primate trim5 reveals the ancient emergence of primate lentiviruses and convergent evolution targeting a conserved capsid interface after entry into target cells, retroviruses encounter the host restriction factors such as fv1 and trim5α. while it is clear that these factors target retrovirus capsid proteins (ca), recognition remains poorly defined in the absence of structural information. to better understand the binding interaction between trim5α and ca, we selected a panel of novel n-tropic murine leukaemia virus (n-mlv) escape mutants by a serial passage of replication competent n-mlv in rhesus macaque trim5α (rhtrim5α)-positive cells using a small percentage of unrestricted cells to allow multiple rounds of virus replication. the newly identified mutations, many of which involve changes in charge, are distributed over the outer ‘top’ surface of n-mlv ca, including the n-terminal β-hairpin, and map up to 29 ao apart. biological characterisation with a number of restriction factors revealed that only one of the new mutations affects restriction by human trim5α, indicating significant differences in the binding interaction between n-mlv and the two trim5αs, whereas three of the mutations result in dual sensitivity to fv1n and fv1b. structural studies of two mutants show that no major changes in the overall ca conformation are associated with escape from restriction. we conclude that interactions involving much, if not all, of the surface of ca are vital for trim5α binding.
serum lipid profile of polycystic ovary syndrome in sudanese women twenty-nine patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) and 30 normal women had lipoprotein lipid and androgen profiles compared after a 12-h fast. both pcos and normal women were evaluated in the proliferative phase of the cycle. pcos patients had higher serum lh to fsh ratios [2.0 +/- 1.3 (+/- sem) vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1), higher testosterone (t; 66 +/- 5 vs. 33 +/- 2 ng/ml), higher free t (1.1 +/- 1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.02 ng/dl), and higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (291 +/- 28 vs. 140 +/- 12 micrograms/dl) levels, and lower t-estrogen-binding globulin-binding capacity (1.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.1 micrograms/dl) than normal women (all p less than 0.05). the pcos patients had higher mean serum triglycerides [122 +/- 11 (+/- sem) 63 +/- 3 mg/dl] and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (24 +/- 2 vs. 13 +/- 1 mg/dl), but lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (43 +/- 2 vs. 58 +/- 2 mg/dl; p less than 0.05). while pcos patients were heavier and more sedentary and their diets were higher in saturated fat and lower in fiber (p less than 0.01, respectively), the differences in lipoprotein lipid concentrations could not be attributed to body weight. t-estrogen-binding globulin-binding capacity correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol in pcos patients (r = 0.42; p = 0.025) after adjusting for weight. we conclude that hyperandrogenemia in women may result in a male pattern of lipoprotein lipid concentrations. these findings suggest that pcos patients may have increased atherogenic potential.
insect-resistant transgenic pinus radiata abstract. a biolistic transformation procedure was applied to co-transform embryogenic tissue of pinus radiata and picea abies with two plasmid dnas. the first vector contained the bar gene, specifying resistance to the herbicide glufosinate, under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. this plasmid also contained the pinus radiata germin cdna sequence, in either sense or antisense orientation, driven by the ubiquitin promoter. the second vector contained both the nptii gene under control of the camv 35s promoter for selection of transgenic tissue on geneticin and the uida reporter gene under control of the double camv 35 promoter. polymerase chain reaction analysis of selected geneticin-resistant tissue showed that the transformation rates for the co-bombarded plasmid were high in both pinus radiata (75%) and picea abies (86%). a combination of phenotypic analysis and northern hybridisation demonstrated that a number of the transgenic lines expressed all four transgenes. regenerated plantlets from pinus radiata and picea abies transgenic lines were spray-tested with commercial rates of buster (glufosinate at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kg active ingredient per hectare). transgenic plants survived and continued to grow with minor or no damage to their needles, whereas non-transgenic plants regenerated from the same cell lines died within 8 weeks of spraying. to our knowledge, this is the first report on genetically engineered herbicide resistance in conifers, and the results demonstrate that this trait is a feasible option for plantation forestry.
polymorphisms in mmp-2 and timp-2 in turkish patients with prostate cancer. background and aims the importance of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and their tissue inhibitors (timps) in tumor progression is well documented. mmp2/timp2 system has a significant impact on the development and progression of cancer and genetic polymorphisms in the promoters of mmp2 (-1306c/t, 735c/t) and timp2 (-418g/a, -303c/t) are correlated with decreased enzyme activity. we sought to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in mmp2 and timp2 polymorphisms may be associated with varying risk of prostate cancer (pca) in men in north india.   methods genotyping was done by pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 190 histologically confirmed pca patients and 200 unrelated, healthy, age-matched individuals of similar ethnicity.   results patients with mmp2 (-1306) ct genotype as well as t allele were at higher risk of pca (p = 0.018; or = 1.68 and p = 0.015; or = 1.52). this effect was even more evident in the case of the t allele carrier (ct + tt) (p = 0.011; or = 1.71). mmp2 (735) c>t, timp2 (-418) g>c and timp2 (-303) c>t polymorphism demonstrated no association. however, timp2 (-418) gc was found to be involved in progression of pca but not in initiation. haplotype results demonstrated that mmp2 (1306t-735c) and timp2 (418g-303t) were associated with a 1.5- and 1.8-fold increased risk, respectively.   conclusions our data indicated that mmp2-1306c>t gene polymorphism contributes to pca susceptibility. these findings suggested mmp2 variants as a predictor of pca progression risk among north indian men. we assume that analysis of these gene polymorphisms can help identify patient subgroups at high risk of poor disease outcome.
evaluating total lymphocyte count as a surrogate marker for cd4 cell count in the management of hiv-infected patients in resource-limited settings: a study from china objectives  total lymphocyte counts (tlc) may be used as an alternative for cd4 cell counts to monitor hiv infection in resource‐limited settings, where cd4 cell counts are too expensive or not available.
nutritional geometry of calcium and phosphorus nutrition in broiler chicks. growth performance, skeletal health and intake arrays. two experiments were conducted to determine the nonphytin phosphorus (npp) requirement for broilers, based on broken line analysis, in the finisher (32 to 42 d) and withdrawal phases (42 to 49 d) of a four-phase feeding program. the determined npp concentrations used were 0.15, 0.19, 0.26, and 0.31% in the finisher phase, experiment 1 (exp 1), and 0.10, 0.13, 0.22, and 0.27% in the withdrawal phase, experiment 2 (exp 2). the analyzed calcium levels in the diets were 0.69 +/- 0.02% and 0.72 +/- 0.05% in exp 1 and 2, respectively. in exp 2, an additional treatment was included in which birds were fed nrc-recommended (1994) npp levels from hatch to 49 d. there were no differences (p>0.05) among dietary treatments in weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency in either experiment. in exp 1, tibia ash weight of birds fed the diets containing 0.15% npp was lower (p<0.05) than that of birds fed diets containing 0.19, 0.26, or 0.31% npp. a requirement of 0.20 +/- 0.01% npp was determined for male broilers weighing between 1,541 to 2,194 g and from 32 to 42 d of age based on broken line analysis of tibia ash weight response to different dietary npp levels. in exp 2, the npp requirement of male broilers weighing between 2,396 g at 42 d and 3,076 g at 49 d, based on tibia ash weight, was 0.16 +/- 0.02% npp.
pre-papillary vitreous opacities associated with behçet’s disease: a case series and review of the literature background to report the ocular manifestations of neuro-behcet's disease.   cases a 34-year-old woman had recurrent meningitis. she developed diplopia, headache, and ataxia, and was diagnosed as having neuro-behcet's disease.   observations imaging revealed two infarct foci in the transitional midbrain and pons. after treatment with prednisolone and colchicine, the diplopia resolved. two years later, a scotoma developed in the right eye, in which the best-corrected visual acuity was 4/200. papillitis and a prepapillary vitreous opacity were seen in the right fundus. these findings disappeared 11 days after subconjunctival steroid injections and increased colchicine. her vision gradually improved to 20/20 two months later.   conclusion neuro-behcet's disease may manifest with transient optic neuritis and prepapillary vitreous opacity.
obesity-mediated inflammatory microenvironment stimulates osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in mice body mass has a positive effect on bone health. whether mass derived from an obesity condition or excessive fat accumulation is beneficial to bone has not been established; neither have the mechanisms by which obesity affects bone metabolism. the aim of this study was to examine the effects of obesity on bone structure and osteoblastic expression of key markers involved in bone formation and resorption in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. six-wk-old male c57bl/6 mice (n=21) were assigned to two groups and fed either a control (10 kcal% energy as fat) or high-fat diet (hfd, 45 kcal% energy as fat) for 14 weeks. bone marrow stromal/osteoblastic cells (bmsc) were cultured. osteoprogenitor activity [alkaline phosphatase (alp) positive colonies] and mineralization (calcium nodule formation) were determined. gene expression was measured using quantitative real-time pcr. bone structure of proximal and midshaft tibia was evaluated by micro-computed tomography. mice fed the hfd were 31% heavier (p<0.01) than those fed the control diet. there were more alp positive colony forming units at d 14 and calcium nodules at d 28 of culture by bmsc from hfd mice than from control mice (p<0.01). receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand (rankl) mrna levels and the ratio of rankl to osteoprotegerin expression in hfd animals was higher (p<0.01) than in control diet animals. serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase levels were higher in hfd fed mice when compared to control diet fed mice (p<0.05). there were no significant differences in tibial fat-free weight, length, and cortical parameters of midshaft between the two groups. compared with control mice, tibial trabecular bone volume was reduced, and trabecular separation was increased in hfd mice. trabecular number was lower (p<0.05) and connectivity density tended to be less (p=0.07) in hfd mice than in control mice. in conclusion, our data indicate that obesity induced by a high-fat diet decreases cancellous bone mass but has no effect on cortical bone mass in the tibia in mice.
the ability of cbcl dsm-oriented scales to predict dsm-iv diagnoses in a referred sample of children and adolescents department of psychology, bryn mawr college separately for ages 11/2 to 5 and 6 to 18, used items for rating behavioral and emotional problems to construct (a) "top-down" dsm-oriented scales from experts' ratings of the items' consistency with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed. [dsm-iv], american psychiatric association, 1994) categories, and (b) "bottom-up" empirically based syndromes from factor analyses of parent, caregiver, teacher, and self ratings (n = 14,853). both kinds of scales are scored from the same assessment instruments and are displayed on profiles normed on the same national samples. psychometric properties were similar for both kinds of scales. associations between counterpart scales were medium to strong. quantified, normed dsm-oriented and empirically based scales scored from the same instruments can facilitate assessment of individuals, statistical analyses for research purposes, and integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to deriving constructs for psychopathology.
root morphology, histology and chemistry of nine fern species (pteridophyta) in a temperate forest ephemeral roots have essential roles in plant and ecosystem functioning. in forests, roots account for a major component of carbon cycling, yet few studies have examined ranges of root trait variation and how different species vary in root form and function in these communities. root branching intensity, specific root length (srl; root length per unit dry mass), root diameter, tissue density, phenolic concentration and nitrogen concentration were determined for the finest two root orders of 25 co-existing north american woody species sampled from mature plants in a single forest community. trait correlations and multivariate patterns were examined to evaluate the most important trait differences among species. branching intensity, srl, and phenolic concentration varied most widely among species (coefficient of variation (cv) = 0.42, 0.57 and 0.58, respectively). species predominately forming ectomycorrhiza (em) had a higher branching intensity than those forming arbuscular mycorrhiza (am) with mycorrhizal types correctly predicted in c. 70% of individual observations by branching intensity alone. there was notably no correlation between srl and nitrogen. variation in srl among species mapped partially along phylogenetic lines (consistency index (ci) = 0.44), with remaining variation attributable to differences in species' ecological specialization. variation found in root traits suggests different nutrient acquisition strategies within this community, which could have potential species-level effects on carbon and mineral nutrient cycling.
green tea polyphenol egcg suppresses osteosarcoma cell growth through upregulating mir-1 previous studies indicate that green tea extract may inhibit breast cancer progression by blocking angiogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms are not well defined. epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg) is the major biologically active component of green tea. in this study we evaluated the cell proliferation and relative gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) expression on hs578t human breast cancer cell line at 24, 48 and 72 hours after 10 microm of egcg treatment. also, we evaluated the effect of this natural compound on the cell migratory behaviour based on real-time xcelligence data. cell proliferation becomes significantly low at 72 hours. egcg had a dual effect on the vegf gene expression timeline: after a first increase at 24 hours, it started to decrease at 48 and 72 hours. the inhibition of cell proliferation at 72 hours suggests a possible reactivation of apoptosis. the dual effect on vegf expression in the presence of egcg suggests the complexity of the angiogenic switch leading to the modulation of the cell migration processes. it also emphasizes the importance of the metabolite products in the modulation of these effects. our findings have shown that egcg suppresses the growth, migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells by inhibiting vegf expression. a better understanding of this mechanism may lead to an improved strategy for tumor therapy based on the inhibition of angiogenesis.
effects of lansoprazole on the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated toll-like receptor 4 signal transduction systems: a study using the 293htlr4/md2-cd14 cells exacerbation of disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is associated with bacterial infection. in conventional dendritic cells (cdcs), the tlr4 ligand bacterial lps induces ifn-β gene expression but does not induce ifn-α. we hypothesized that when cdcs are primed by cytokines, as may frequently be the case in sle, lps would then induce the production of ifn-α, a cytokine believed to be important in lupus pathogenesis. in this study we show that mouse cdcs and human monocytes produce abundant ifn-α following tlr4 engagement whether the cells have been pretreated either with ifn-β or with a supernatant from dcs activated by rna-containing immune complexes from lupus patients. this tlr4-induced ifn-α induction is mediated by both an initial trif-dependent pathway and a subsequent myd88-dependent pathway, in contrast to tlr3-induced ifn-α production, which is entirely trif-dependent. there is also a distinct requirement for ifn regulatory factors (irfs), with lps-induced ifn-α induction being entirely irf7- and partially irf5-dependent, in contrast to lps -induced ifn-β gene induction which is known to be irf3-dependent but largely irf7-independent. this data demonstrates a novel pathway for ifn-α production by cdcs and provides one possible explanation for how bacterial infection might precipitate disease flares in sle.
combinatorial library-based profiling of the antibody response against hepatitis c virus in humans. to determine whether there was a correlation between the kinetics or frequency of antibody to mammalian-derived hepatitis c virus (hcv) second envelope protein (e2) and development of chronicity or self-limitation of hcv infections, serial sera were examined for anti-e2, anti-hcv with confirmation with matrix 2.0 (abbott laboratories, abbott park, il), and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) from 6 cases of self-limited infection and 6 cases of chronic infection in chimpanzees, and from 5 cases of self-limited infection and 3 cases of chronic infection in patients. anti-e2 developed earlier, more frequently, and to higher titer in chimpanzees and patients who were developing chronic infection than in those with self-limited infections. thus anti-e2 is unlikely to play a role in self-limitation of the infection. however, long-term persistence of anti-e2 correlates with chronic infection. there was little or no correlation between the timing of development of anti-e2 and anti-hcv.
prefrontal inhibition of threat processing reduces working memory interference the human pupillary response, whose final neural pathways are mediated through the autonomic nervous system, has been shown to reflect more centrally occurring processes when examined from the perspective of information processing activities. this paper will examine components of information processing as reflected in the pupillary response, and its relation to other neurophysiological signs of cognitive activity, most notably, event-related brain potentials. both the constriction of the pupil to light (miosis), as well as the dilation (dilatation; mydriasis) resulting from information delivery, have provided useful adjuncts in the study of psychopathology, especially with reference to schizophrenia. the time course of pupillary dilation, reflected in the morphology of the pupillographic record, indicates a high degree of similarity among related family members. findings from psychiatric patients and their relatives will be reviewed. while the contributions of separate physiological components to the pupillary dilation response that relate to cognitive activity have never been adequately delineated, a review of findings indicates the possibility for experimental dissection of components. a model delineating likely psychophysiological contributions to the pupillary response, and approaches for testing the model, will be presented.
increased cytosolic free mg2+and ca2+ in platelets of patients with vasospastic angina. there is controversy as to whether platelet intracellular free calcium ([ca2+]i) is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) as compared with wistar-kyoto (wky) rats. discrepant results may be due to methodological problems including platelet activation during the collection process and leakage of intracellular dye used for [ca2+]i measurement. to provide further insight into this problem, [ca2+]i was estimated in fura-2-loaded platelets isolated from eight shr and seven wky rats at 12-14 weeks of age by using a two-syringe blood collection method and a correction method for fura-2 leakage. basal [ca2+]i was higher in shr than in wky rats (61.6 +/- 5.6 vs. 54.0 +/- 3.9 nm, p less than 0.02). however, the difference disappeared when a correction for fura-2 leakage was not used (109.7 +/- 18.4 vs. 94.9 +/- 9.2 nm, p less than 0.1). thus, differences in [ca2+]i between shr and wky rats may be obscured if dye leakage from platelets is not taken into account. thrombin (0.1 units/ml) induced a rise in [ca2+]i that was greater in shr than wky rats, both in the presence (491.4 +/- 31.6 vs. 377.5 +/- 21.7 nm, p less than 0.002) and absence (264.9 +/- 33.6 vs. 228.2 +/- 30.1 nm, p less than 0.05) of calcium in the media. these results indicate that thrombin-stimulated calcium influx as well as discharge of calcium from intracellular stores is increased in shr platelets. thus, under both basal and stimulated conditions, platelet calcium handling is abnormal in the shr.
effects of lansoprazole on the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated toll-like receptor 4 signal transduction systems: a study using the 293htlr4/md2-cd14 cells exacerbation of disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is associated with bacterial infection. in conventional dendritic cells (cdcs), the tlr4 ligand bacterial lps induces ifn-β gene expression but does not induce ifn-α. we hypothesized that when cdcs are primed by cytokines, as may frequently be the case in sle, lps would then induce the production of ifn-α, a cytokine believed to be important in lupus pathogenesis. in this study we show that mouse cdcs and human monocytes produce abundant ifn-α following tlr4 engagement whether the cells have been pretreated either with ifn-β or with a supernatant from dcs activated by rna-containing immune complexes from lupus patients. this tlr4-induced ifn-α induction is mediated by both an initial trif-dependent pathway and a subsequent myd88-dependent pathway, in contrast to tlr3-induced ifn-α production, which is entirely trif-dependent. there is also a distinct requirement for ifn regulatory factors (irfs), with lps-induced ifn-α induction being entirely irf7- and partially irf5-dependent, in contrast to lps -induced ifn-β gene induction which is known to be irf3-dependent but largely irf7-independent. this data demonstrates a novel pathway for ifn-α production by cdcs and provides one possible explanation for how bacterial infection might precipitate disease flares in sle.
most tissue-resident macrophages except microglia are derived from fetal hematopoietic stem cells. blood monocytes differentiate into distinct colonic macrophage or dendritic cell subsets depending on the presence or absence of inflammation
gmagl1, a mads-box gene from soybean, is involved in floral organ identity and fruit dehiscence the c-function, according to the abc model of floral organ identity, is required for stamen and carpel development and to provide floral meristem determinacy. members of the ag lineage of the large mads box gene family specify the c-function in a broadly conserved manner in angiosperms. in core eudicots, two sub-lineages co-exist, euag and ple, which have been extensively characterized in antirrhinum majus and arabidopsis thaliana, where strong sub-functionalization has led to highly divergent contributions of the respective paralogs to the c-function. various scenarios have been proposed to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the euag and ple lineages in eudicots, but detailed functional analyses of the roles of these genes in additional representative species to validate evolutionary hypotheses are scarce. here, we report functional characterization of euag- and ple-like genes in nicotiana benthamiana through expression analyses and phenotypic characterization of the defects caused by their specific down-regulation. we show that both paralogs redundantly contribute to the c-function in this species, providing insights on the likely evolution of these gene lineages following divergence of the major groups within the eudicots (rosids and asterids). moreover, we have demonstrated a conserved role for the ple-like genes in controlling fruit dehiscence, which strongly supports the ancestral role of ple-like genes in late fruit development and suggests a common evolutionary origin of late developmental processes in dry (dehiscent) and fleshy (ripening) fruits.
interest rate uncertainty , hedging , and real activity ∗ we examine investment behavior when firms face costs in the access to external funds. we find that despite the existence of liquidity constraints, standard investment regressions predict that cash flow is an important determinant of investment only if one ignores q. conversely, we also obtain significant cash flow effects even in the absence of financial frictions. these findings provide support to the argument that the success of cash flow augmented investment regressions is probably due to a combination of measurement error in q and identification problems.
quality of service (qos) support for multimedia applications in large-scale networks recent network traffic studies argue that network arrival processes are much more faithfully modeled using statistically self-similar processes instead of traditional poisson processes [ltww94a, pf94]. one difficulty in dealing with self-similar models is how to efficiently synthesize traces (sample paths) corresponding to self-similar traffic. we present a fast fourier transform method for synthesizing approximate self-similar sample paths and assess its performance and validity. we find that the method is as fast or faster than existing methods and appears to generate a closer approximation to true self-similar sample paths than the other known fast method (random midpoint displacement). we then discuss issues in using such synthesized sample paths for simulating network traffic, and how an approximation used by our method can dramatically speed up evaluation of whittle`s estimator for h, the hurst parameter giving the strength of long-range dependence present in a self-similar time series.
seroprevalence and potential risk factors associated with neospora spp. infection among asymptomatic horses in jordan sera from 800 asymptomatic horses were examined for the presence of antibodies to neospora caninum by immunofluorescence antibody test (ifat). the presence of antibodies to n. caninum was also tested in sera from 52 mares that had aborted and 40 horses exhibiting neurological signs. a total of 95 (11.9%) of the 800 sera had antibodies for neospora. significantly higher seropositivity was obtained from horses that had neurological signs (21.2%) and from aborted mares (37.5%). there was significant linear-by-linear association between age and seropositivity. this is the first serologic survey for neospora spp. antibodies performed on horses from the middle east and the first to report significant difference in seropositivity between asymptomatic horses and horses exhibiting neurological signs.
surgical versus low-dose progestin treatment for endometriosis-associated severe deep dyspareunia ii: effect on sexual functioning, psychological status and health-related quality of life. background among subjects with endometriosis and deep dyspareunia (dd), those with endometriosis of the uterosacral ligament (usle) have the most severe impairment of sexual function. this study examines the effect of laparoscopic excision of endometriosis on dd and quality of sex life.   methods this observational cohort prospective study included 68 women with endometriosis suffering dd (intensity of pain >or= 6 on a 10-cm visual analogue scale). patients underwent laparoscopic full excision of endometriosis. following surgery, they were asked to use nonhormonal contraception devices. before surgery, at 6- and at 12-month follow-up, patients answered a self-administered questionnaire based on the sexual satisfaction subscale of the derogatis sexual functioning inventory.   results at 6- and 12-month follow-up, women with and without usle had significant improvement in dd. subjects with usle reported increased variety in sex life, increased frequency of intercourse, more satisfying orgasms with sex, relaxing more easily during sex and being more relaxed and fulfilled after sex. similar improvements were observed among women without usle; however, for some variables statistical significance was not reached.   conclusions surgical excision of endometriosis improves not only dd but also the quality of sex life.
fear of falling, fracture history, and comorbidities are associated with health-related quality of life among european and us women with osteoporosis in a large international study introductionan important component of cost effectiveness models in the field of osteoporosis is the set of health state utility values (hsuvs) used for key fracture outcomes. this paper presents a review of hsuvs for key osteoporotic states (hip, wrist, shoulder, clinical, and morphometric vertebral fractures, established osteoporosis, and interaction of several fractures). it provides an update to the systematic review conducted by brazier et al. (osteoporos int 13(10):768–776, 2002).materials and methodsa systematic search was undertaken of the main literature databases for hsuvs for established osteoporosis, vertebral, hip, wrist, and shoulder fractures were identified. studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed in terms of the patient population, the method of describing health (if not obtained directly from patients), the method of valuing health states and the source of values.resultsestimates of health state utility values were found across the osteoporosis conditions from 27 studies. a wide range of empirical estimates were found, partly due to differences in valuation technique (vas, sg, tto), descriptive system and differences in respondents (population or patient), the perspective of the task (own health or a scenario), sample size, and study quality.conclusionthe paper provides a set of multipliers representing the loss in hsuvs for use as a “reference case” in cost-effectiveness models.

prevalence of human papilloma virus and human herpes virus types 1–7 in human nasal polyposis primary nasal lymphomas of t or nk cell origin are known to be associated with epstein-barr virus (ebv). however, it is not known whether ebv is normally present in nasal mucosa as distinct to nasopharyngeal tissue. this study investigates the prevalence of ebv infection in 13 cases of nasal polyps. ebv dna was detected in 2 of 13 (15%) by southern blot hybridization and in 9 of 13 (69%) by polymerase chain reaction. in situ hybridization for ebv-encoded small nuclear rnas (eber) was positive in 11 of 13 (85%) cases; the virus was present in stromal lymphocytes only and not in the epithelial cells. immunohistochemistry for ebv proteins in 7 cases revealed ebv nuclear antigen (ebna)-2, latent membrane protein (lmp)-1, and zebra (the switch protein encoded by gene bzlf1) expression in rare isolated stromal lymphocytes in 3 cases. double immunostaining in 1 case showed that the lmp-1+ cells were b or t cells. immunohistochemistry for ebv lytic proteins showed very rare viral capsid antigen (vca)+ and membrane antigen (ma)+ cells in 1 case and very rare diffuse early antigen (ea-d)+ and vca+ cells in 1 other case. the expression of zebra, ea-d, vca, and ma suggested a disruption of latency in very rare stromal lymphocytes leading to a productive cycle. although the incidence of ebv positivity in nasal polyps in our population is high (85%), very low numbers of ebv+ cells are found in each case. nevertheless, they indicate that nasal mucosa could be one of the sites of ebv persistence through a low level of infection of the resident lymphocytes and thereby provide a possible setting for the emergence of virally associated tumors in this site.
sex-biased gene expression on the avian z chromosome: highly expressed genes show higher male-biased expression the determination of the chimpanzee genome sequence provides a means to study both structural and functional aspects of the evolution of the human genome. here we compare humans and chimpanzees with respect to differences in expression levels and protein-coding sequences for genes active in brain, heart, liver, kidney, and testis. we find that the patterns of differences in gene expression and gene sequences are markedly similar. in particular, there is a gradation of selective constraints among the tissues so that the brain shows the least differences between the species whereas liver shows the most. furthermore, expression levels as well as amino acid sequences of genes active in more tissues have diverged less between the species than have genes active in fewer tissues. in general, these patterns are consistent with a model of neutral evolution with negative selection. however, for x-chromosomal genes expressed in testis, patterns suggestive of positive selection on sequence changes as well as expression changes are seen. furthermore, although genes expressed in the brain have changed less than have genes expressed in other tissues, in agreement with previous work we find that genes active in brain have accumulated more changes on the human than on the chimpanzee lineage.
the significance of uvj-m and puva in diagnosing stress urinary incontinence in women purpose occult tethered cord syndrome, in which there is normal neuroanatomic imaging despite clinical and urodynamic evidence of neuropathic bladder behavior, is controversial. several uncontrolled series describe improvement in bladder function following section of the filum terminale. we performed a pilot randomized, controlled study comparing medical treatment to surgical section of the filum plus medical treatment in children with occult tethered cord syndrome.   materials and methods children refractory to standard medical management for 1 year or more with normal conus position on magnetic resonance imaging and abnormal urodynamics were randomized. exclusion criteria included any neurological conditions, spinal dysraphism, bladder outlet obstruction and an atonic bladder. patients were assessed at randomization and 1 year later with a standardized urodynamic score, the validated pemqol (pediatric enuresis module on quality of life™) scale, and a validated bowel and bladder dysfunction score.   results after 8 years we accrued 21 patients. the bowel and bladder dysfunction score improved in the surgical and medical arms (20% and 24%) and the urodynamic score improved slightly (6% and 4%, respectively). the pemqol child and family impact scales improved modestly in both groups. all differences were nonsignificant. interim analysis indicated that more than 700 patients in each arm would be required to demonstrate a statistical difference with respect to urodynamic score based on our preliminary data.   conclusions there appears to be no objective difference in urological outcome between medical management plus or minus filum section for patients with occult tethered cord syndrome. these data challenge the existence of the concept of occult tethered cord syndrome, in which bowel and bladder dysfunction score is attributed to tethering by the filum despite a normally located conus.
sex differences in clinical presentation and response in panic disorder: pooled data from sertraline treatment studies unlabelled a gradual decline in estrogen levels after the age of 40 may contribute to a higher rate of depression in women over 45 years of age. estrogen replacement therapy (ert) has been shown to produce cognitive and mood-enhancing effects in women and may facilitate antidepressant activity.   methods we examined the efficacy rates in women on ert > or = 45 years (n = 40) compared to women > or = 45 years not on ert (n = 132) and to women < 45 years (n = 396) and to men (n = 262) with major depression during fluoxetine 20 mg daily up to 8 weeks. remitters with a ham-d17 score < or = 7 from week 9 to 12 were then treated up to 1-year in a placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial.   results efficacy rates were similar in women > or = 45 years on ert when compared to women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine alone, and when compared to women < 45 years and men taking fluoxetine. a kaplan-meier survival analysis in fluoxetine responders treated up to 26 weeks showed a somewhat greater relapse rate in women > or = 45 years taking ert compared to other treatment groups (p < 0.06).   limitations this study was retrospective nature and ert was given in an uncontrolled fashion: 63% of women received estrogen alone while 37% also took intermittent progesterone. other variables include the absence of hormonal documentation of menopausal status, no direct assessment of ert compliance and the use of fixed-dose fluoxetine 20 mg daily.   conclusion in contrast to prior reports suggesting that ert may facilitate antidepressant activity, we observed similar efficacy in depressed women > or = 45 years taking fluoxetine plus ert compared to those taking fluoxetine alone.
multi-trait genomic prediction for nitrogen response indices in tropical maize hybrids new proposals for models and applications of prediction processes with data on molecular markers may help reduce the financial costs of and identify superior genotypes in maize breeding programs. studies evaluating genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gblup) models including dominance effects have not been performed in the univariate and multivariate context in the data analysis of this crop. a single cross hybrid construction procedure was performed in this study using phenotypic data and actual molecular markers of 4,091 maize lines from the public database panzea. a total of 400 simple hybrids resulting from this process were analyzed using the univariate and multivariate gblup model considering only additive effects additive plus dominance effects. historic heritability scenarios of five traits and other genetic architecture settings were used to compare models, evaluating the predictive ability and estimation of variance components. marginal differences were detected between the multivariate and univariate models. the main explanation for the small discrepancy between models is the low- to moderate-magnitude correlations between the traits studied and moderate heritabilities. these conditions do not favor the advantages of multivariate analysis. the inclusion of dominance effects in the models was an efficient strategy to improve the predictive ability and estimation quality of variance components.
urgent surgery after emergency presentation for colorectal cancer has no impact on overall and disease-free survival: a propensity score analysis background although a significantly decreased long-term survival has been observed in patients undergoing surgery for complicated colorectal tumors compared with uncomplicated ones, the role of radical oncologic surgery on emergency colonic cancer is not defined clearly. the aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of a curative emergency surgery in terms of tumor recurrence and cancer-related survival compared with elective colonic surgery.   methods between january 1996 and december 1998, all patients with colonic cancer deemed to have undergone a curative resection were considered for inclusion in this prospective study. patients were classified into 2 groups: group 1, after emergency surgery for complicated colonic cancer, and group 2, patients undergoing elective surgery. the main end points were cancer-related survival and the probability of being free from recurrence at 3 years.   results of the 266 patients included in the study, 59 patients (22.2%) were in group 1 and 207 patients (77.8%) were in group 2. postoperative mortality was higher in group 1 (p=.0004). after patients were stratified by the tumor node metastasis system, differences between the groups with respect to overall survival of stage ii tumors (p=.0728), the probability of being free from recurrence (p=.0827), and cancer-related survival (p=.1071) of stage iii cancers did not reach statistical significance. differences were observed for the overall survival in stage iii tumors (p=.0007), and for the probability of being free from recurrence (p=.0011) and cancer-related survival (p=.0029) in stage ii cancers. when patients with elective stage ii tumors presenting 1 or more negative prognostic factor were compared with emergency patients affected by a stage ii colonic cancer, no differences were observed.   conclusion curative surgeries for complicated colonic cancer are acceptable in emergency conditions. cancer-related survival and recurrence in patients with complicated colonic cancers may approach that of elective surgery if a surgical treatment with radical oncologic criteria is performed.
vertex-coloring edge-weighting of bipartite graphs with two edge weights a partition of the edges of a graph g into sets {s1,..., sk} defines a multiset xv for each vertex v where the multiplicity of i in xv is the number of edges incident to v in si we show that the edges of every graph can be partitioned into 4 sets such that the resultant multisets give a vertex colouring of g. in other words, for every edge (u, v) of g, xu ≠ xv. furthermore, if g has minimum degree at least 1000, then there is a partition of e(g) into 3 sets such that the corresponding multisets yield a vertex colouring.
[relationship between cigarette smoking and the carbon monoxide concentration in the exhaled breath with perioperative respiratory complications]. background smoking is considered to be a risk factor for patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia, but it is unclear whether this is applicable to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. the aim of this study was to determine the risk of respiratory complications and wound infection among smokers. methods the authors studied a random selection of 489 adult patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. smoking status was determined by self-report and confirmed with end-expired carbon monoxide analysis. the risk of respiratory complications (i.e., desaturation, cough, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, breath-holding, or apnea) and wound infection (i.e., wound redness or discharge ± positive microbial culture, requiring antibiotic therapy) in smokers versus nonsmokers was ascertained. odds ratios were estimated from multivariable logistic regression and adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, partner's smoking status, domiciliary smoking exposure, and extent and duration of surgery. results most smokers continued to smoke up until the day of surgery. smokers had a higher rate of respiratory complications (32.8%vs. 25.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.84;p = 0.038) and wound infection (3.6%vs. 0.6%; odds ratio, 16.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.58–175;p = 0.019). odds ratios comparing current plus ex-smokers with nonsmokers were of similar magnitude for most of these complications. conclusions smoking was associated with an increased risk of respiratory complications and postoperative wound infection in ambulatory surgery patients. these findings warrant increased efforts at promoting smoking avoidance and cessation.
efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil in lupus nephritis the aim of this study was to assess the efficacies and toxicities of immunosuppressive treatments for lupus nephritis (ln) versus cyclophosphamide (cyc). a meta-analysis was performed to determine treatment efficacy and toxicity outcomes between mycophenolate mofetil (mmf) and cyc induction therapies, between mmf and azathioprine (aza) as maintenance therapies, and between low-dose intravenous (iv) cyc and high-dose iv cyc therapy. ten randomized controlled trials (rcts) were included in the meta-analysis. in terms of induction therapies, mmf did not increase complete remission or partial remission rates as compared with cyc. however, the relative risks (rrs) of amenorrhea and leukopenia tended to be lower in the mmf group than in the cyc group. meta-analysis of mmf versus aza as a maintenance therapy showed no difference between the two groups in terms of response rates or the risk of developing end-stage renal disease. low-dose iv cyc therapy had lower relapse rates than high-dose iv cyc therapy (rr 0.465, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.261—0.830, p-value 0.010), and was associated with a lower infection risk (rr 0.688, 95% ci 0.523—0.905, p-value 0.008). in conclusion, mmf was found to be as effective as cyc and tended to have a better safety profile as an induction therapy for ln than cyc.
interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity and manual skills in children with unilateral cerebral palsy objective to examine the reorganisation of the somatosensory system after early brain lesions.   methods we studied 12 young patients with congenital hemiplegia. causative lesions were brain malformations, periventricular injuries and cortico-subcortical lesions. we explored the somatosensory system using evoked potentials, fmri during sensory stimulation and clinical assessment of sensory function. to correlate sensory and motor function, we also performed transcranial magnetic stimulation, fmri of hand movement and assessment of motor function by means of melbourne test.   results eleven patients showed a perilesional reorganisation of primary somatosensory function, as expressed by short latency potentials following stimulation of the paretic hand; in a remaining patient, delayed latency responses (n27.1) were only elicited over the ipsilateral undamaged hemisphere. five of the eleven patients with perilesional somatosensory representation of the affected hand showed contralesional shifting of motor function, thus exhibiting sensory-motor dissociation. significant correlation was found between sensory deficit and fmri activation during sensory stimulation.   conclusions in subjects with early brain lesions, somato-sensory function is generally reorganised within the affected hemisphere. a contralesional shifting is uncommon and poorly efficient in function restoration.   significance this study confirms and further explores the difference in reorganisation capabilities of the motor and sensory system following early brain injury of different etiologies and timing.
inhibition of nonneuronal alpha7-nicotinic receptor for lung cancer treatment. retraction: the following article from international journal of cancer, "inhibition of non‐neuronal α7‐nicotinic receptor reduces tumorigenicity in a549 nsclc xenografts", by laura paleari, fausto sessa, alessia catassi, denis servent, gilles mourier, guido doria‐miglietta, emanuela ognio, michele cilli, lorenzo dominioni, massimo paolucci, andrea calcaterra, alfredo cesario, stefano margaritora, pierluigi granone and patrizia russo, published online in wiley interscience (http://www3.interscience.wiley.com) on 22 january 2009, volume 125, issue 1, pages 199‐211, has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal editor in chief, peter lichter, and wiley periodicals, inc. the retraction has been agreed due to unverified data.
a sustainability assessment of a health equity fund initiative in cambodia. sustainability continues to be a serious concern for primary health care (phc) interventions targeting the death of millions of children in developing countries each year. our work with over 30 non-governmental organizations (ngos) implementing usaid's child survival and health grants program (cshgp)-funded projects revealed the need for a study to develop a framework for sustainability assessment in these projects. we surveyed ngo informants and project managers through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. this paper summarizes our study findings. the ngos share key values about sustainability, but are skeptical about approaches perceived as disconnected from field reality. in their experience, sustainable achievements occur through the interaction of capable local stakeholders and communities. this depends strongly on enabling conditions, which ngo projects should advance. sustainability assessment is multidimensional, value-based and embeds health within a larger sustainable development perspective. it reduces, but does not eliminate, the unpredictability of long-term outcomes. it should start with the consideration of the 'local systems' which need to develop a common purpose. our ability to address the complexity inherent to sustainability thinking rests with the validity of the models used to design interventions. a participant, qualitative research approach helped us make sense of sustainability in ngo field practice.
long-term effects of binary mixtures of 17α-ethinyl estradiol and dibutyl phthalate in a partial life-cycle test with zebrafish (danio rerio). phthalate ester plasticizers are antiandrogenic in mammals. high doses of certain phthalates consistently interfere with the normal development of male offspring exposed in utero, causing disrupted sperm production, abnormal development of the genitalia, and in some cases infertility. in the environment, phthalates are considered ubiquitous and are commonly measured in aquatic ecosystems at low nanograms to micrograms per liter concentrations. given the similarity between mammalian and teleost endocrine systems, phthalate esters may be able to cause antiandrogenic endocrine disruption in fish in the wild. in the present study, adult male three-spined sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculetaus; n = 8) were exposed to di-n-butyl phthalate (dbp; 0, 15, and 35 µg dbp/l) for 22 d and analyzed for changes in nesting behavior, plasma androgen concentrations, spiggin concentrations, and steroidogenic gene expression. plasma testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in males from the 35 µg dbp/l group compared with the solvent control, whereas plasma 11-ketotestosterone concentrations were not significantly affected. expression of steroid acute regulatory protein and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase remained unchanged. spiggin concentrations were significantly lower in the males exposed to 35 µg dbp/l. nest building appeared to be slower in some males exposed to dbp, but this was not statistically significant. these results suggest that dbp has antiandrogenic effects in fish. however, further research is required to firmly establish the consequences of chronic dbp exposure in fish.
increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase among gram-negative bacilli in latin america--2008 update from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart). background the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) was begun in 2002 to monitor international drug-resistance patterns among aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections.   methods in 2002, 40 medical centers from 17 countries collected consecutive non-duplicate isolates from intra-abdominal infections for susceptibility testing against 12 antimicrobial agents using the broth microdilution methods recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards).   results a total of 3,134 aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli were isolated. enterobacteriaceae accounted for 82% of the total and were most consistently susceptible to amikacin and the carbapenems. escherichia coli (45%) and klebsiella spp. (17%) were the most common species. the susceptibility rates of these organisms to the 12 antimicrobial agents differed among geographic regions, with isolates from the asia/pacific and latin american regions usually having the highest rates of resistance. ampicillin/sulbactam was the agent least frequently active against e. coli (56% susceptible) and klebsiella spp. (73% susceptible). extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were detected phenotypically in 7% of e. coli, 13% of klebsiella spp., and 18% of enterobacter spp. producers of esbl overall had a more antibiotic-resistant profile than non-producers but were usually susceptible to carbapenems.   conclusions antimicrobial resistance rates among gram-negative bacilli isolated from intra-abdominal infections differed among geographic regions. the carbapenems were consistently active in vitro against enterobacteriaceae worldwide, including esbl producers.
determinants of patient satisfaction following reconstructive shoulder surgery the purpose of this investigation was to identify the determinants of patient satisfaction with outcome after hemiarthroplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty. seventy patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty were studied to determine predictors of patient satisfaction. patient satisfaction was graded on an ordinal scale from 1 to 10. there was a significant association between patient satisfaction and age (p = .010) and between patient satisfaction and worker's compensation status (p = .018). there was no significant decrease in patient satisfaction for patients with rotator cuff tears. patient satisfaction was significantly associated with all pain and function variables at follow-up (p < .05). the american shoulder and elbow surgeons score was significantly correlated with patient satisfaction (p = 0.680, p < .05). independent predictors of satisfaction included pain with activities of daily living, painless use of the arm above the shoulder, and difficulty with toileting (r(2) = 0.555). subjective variables associated with pain were independent predictors of patient satisfaction. thus, in assessing patient satisfaction after shoulder arthroplasty, we emphasize the importance of patient-derived subjective assessment of symptoms and function.
cytotoxic polyketides from the deep-sea-derived fungus engyodontium album dffscs021 three new sesquiterpenes, named aspergillusenes a and b and (+)-(7s)-7-o-methylsydonic acid, and two new hydrogenated xanthone derivatives, named aspergillusones a and b, were isolated from the sea fan-derived fungus aspergillus sydowii psu-f154 together with 10 known compounds. their structures were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data. the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activity.

a quantitative approach to blastocyst quality evaluation: morphometric analysis and related ivf outcomes objective to investigate the predictive value of quantitative measurements of blastocyst morphology on subsequent implantation rates after transfer.   design prospective observational study.   setting private assisted reproductive technology center.   patient(s) one hundred seventy-four ivf patients receiving transfers of expanded blastocyst-stage embryos on day 5 (n = 112) or day 6 (n = 62) after oocyte retrieval.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) blastocyst diameter, number of trophectoderm cells, inner cell mass (icm) size, icm shape, and implantation and pregnancy rates.   result(s) blastocyst diameter and trophectoderm cell numbers were unrelated to implantation rates. day 5 expanded blastocysts with icms of >4,500 microm(2) implanted at a higher rate than did those with smaller icms (55% vs. 31%). day 5 expanded blastocysts with slightly oval icms implanted at a higher rate (58%) compared with those with either rounder icms (7%) or more elongated icms (33%). implantation rates were highest (71%) for embryos with both optimal icm size and shape. pregnancy rates were higher for day 5 transfers of optimally shaped icms compared with day 5 transfers of optimally sized icms.   conclusion(s) quantitative measurements of the inner cell mass are highly indicative of blastocyst implantation potential. blastocysts with relatively large and/or slightly oval icms are more likely to implant than other blastocysts.
a rapid method for detecting and quantifying bacterial dna in rust fungal dna samples. jejunum digesta samples were taken from weaning pigs in order to evaluate real-time pcr (qpcr) as a method for quantifying pig gut bacteria. total bacteria, lactobacilli and enterobacteria were quantified by qpcr and the results were compared with those obtained with traditional methods: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi staining) for total bacteria, selective culture for lactobacilli and enterobacteria. real-time pcr showed higher values in terms of 16s rrna gene copies than dapi counts or cfu. despite the differences, the lactobacilli:enterobacteria ratio was similar between methods (2.5 +/- 0.58 for qpcr and 3.1 +/- 0.71 for selective culture, p = 0.39). possible reasons for the higher pcr counts are discussed considering both an overestimation with pcr by quantification of dead bacteria or free dna and also an underestimation with conventional methods. inherent differences in the pre-treatment of the samples could partially explain the discrepancies observed. regardless of the numerical differences between methods, values obtained by qpcr and traditional methods showed a significant correlation for lactobacilli and total bacteria. in the light of these results, real-time pcr seems a valid method to quantify microbial shifts in the gastrointestinal tract.
real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of cyp1b1 gene expression in human liver. immunoblot analysis of human livers using a monospecific antibody to rat cyp1a2 section demonstrated that the expression of cyp1a2 protein is highly variable in human liver. quantitative pcr analysis was then employed to examine the interindividual variability of both cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 mrnas in human liver. hepatic content of cyp1a2 mrna correlated significantly with levels of cyp1a2 protein as analysed by immunoblot analysis (r = 0.58; p < 0.01). cyp1a2 mrna content varied > 40-fold among individuals while cyp1a1 content varied > 20-fold. cyp1a2 mrna was higher than cyp1a1 mrna (approximately two to 30-fold) in livers of different individuals. the individual with the highest cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 mrna amounts was a current smoker, but mrna expression in two other smokers was within the range observed among nonsmokers. the expression of the two cyp1a mrnas correlated highly (r = 0.72; p < 0.0005) when smokers were included, but the correlation was less significant (r = 0.62; p < 0.05) in nonsmokers. we amplified a full-length cyp1a2 cdna clone by pcr from a liver which expressed extremely low amounts of cyp1a2 protein. sequence analysis indicated that exon 4 was missing in this clone, but no other sequence changes were found. pcr analysis demonstrated that both the normally spliced mrna and abnormally spliced mrna could be detected in all human livers examined, but the normally spliced mrna was more abundant than the splice variant. therefore, sequence changes in the coding region of cyp1a2 did not account for the poor expression of cyp1a2 in this individual.
step-by-step evolution of neo-sex chromosomes in geographical populations of wild silkmoths, samia cynthia ssp. backgroundrecent translocations of autosomal regions to the sex chromosomes represent important systems for identifying the evolutionary forces affecting convergent patterns of sex-chromosome heteromorphism. additions to the sex chromosomes have been reported in the melanica and robusta species groups, two sister clades of drosophila. the close relationship between these two species groups and the similarity of their rearranged karyotypes motivates this test of alternative hypotheses; the rearranged sex chromosomes in both groups are derived through a common origin, or the rearrangements are derived through at least two independent origins. here we examine chromosomal arrangement in representatives of the melanica and the robusta species groups and test these alternative hypotheses using a phylogenetic approach.resultstwo mitochondrial and two nuclear gene sequences were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of a set of nine ingroup species having fused and unfused sex chromosomes and representing a broad sample of both species groups. different methods of phylogenetic inference, coupled with concurrent cytogenetic analysis, indicate that the hypothesis of independent origins of rearranged sex chromosomes within each species group is significantly more likely than the alternative hypothesis of a single common origin. an estimate tightly constrained around 8 my was obtained for the age of the rearranged sex chromosomes in the melanica group; however, a more loosely constrained estimate of 10–15 my was obtained for the age of the rearrangement in the robusta group.conclusionindependent acquisition of new chromosomal arms by the sex chromosomes in the melanica and robusta species groups represents a case of striking convergence at the karyotypic level. our findings indicate that the parallel divergence experienced by newly sex-linked genomic regions in these groups represents an excellent system for studying the tempo of sex chromosome evolution.
bisphenol a detection in various brands of drinking bottled water in riyadh, saudi arabia using gas chromatography/mass spectrometer the aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of endocrine disrupting compounds (edcs) in bottled waters. the examined compounds were bisphenol a (bpa), nonylphenol (np), tert-octylphenol (top), dimethyl phthalate (dmp), diethyl phthalate (dep), di-n-butyl phthalate (dbp), butyl benzyl phthalate (bbp), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (dehp) and di(n-octyl)phthalate (dnop). the presence of edcs in bottled waters under poor storage conditions was also investigated after exposure outdoors under realistic conditions for 15 and 30 days. edcs were recovered after liquid-liquid extraction and determined by employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. most of these compounds were detected in bottled water from different brands purchased from local market. storage at outdoor conditions had no significant effect on the concentrations of the examined compounds. only bpa occurred at higher concentrations in polycarbonate containers exhibited an increasing trend during exposure. the estimated exposure to edcs via consumption of drinking water was very low.
decrease in serum interleukin-21 levels is associated with disease activity improvement in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis. objective. to investigate the levels of the t helper (th)17-related cytokines interleukin 17a (il-17a), il-21, and il-23 and their association with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods. in a longitudinal sample set from patients with early ra (< 6 months; n = 40), we measured the plasma cytokine levels of il-17a, il-21, and il-23 and analyzed for correlation with disease activity in 28 joints (disease activity score 28-joint count; das28), c-reactive protein (crp), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), and total sharp score (tss). in a transverse sample set of patients with chronic ra (> 8 years), using paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells, we investigated the cellular expression of il-17a, il-21, and il-23r. results. patients with early-stage ra had significantly increased plasma levels of il-21 and il-23, but not il-17a, compared to patients with chronic ra and healthy volunteer controls. plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 after 12 months of treatment correlated with das28 and esr, but not to tss. changes in il-23 plasma levels from time of diagnosis to 12 months correlated with change in das28 and with tss scores at 2 years. the numbers of cd4+ t cells producing il-21 were significantly increased in the synovial fluid of patients with chronic ra, with only marginal coexpression of il-21 and il-17a. conclusion. our results show a significant association between plasma levels of il-21 and il-23 and disease activity in ra, supporting the hypothesis that il-21 and il-23 are important pathogenic factors of this disease.
gestational hypoxia modulates expression of corticotropin‐releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin in the paraventricular nucleus in the ovine fetus we previously communicated that long-term hypoxia (lth) resulted in a selective reduction in plasma epinephrine following acute stress in fetal sheep. the present study tested the hypothesis that lth selectively reduces adrenomedullary expression of phenylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase (pnmt), the rate-limiting enzyme for epinephrine synthesis. we also examined the effect of lth on adrenomedullary nicotinic, muscarinic, and glucocorticoid receptor (gr) expression. ewes were maintained at high altitude (3,820 m) from 30 to 138 days gestation (dga); adrenomedullary tissue was collected from lth and age-matched, normoxic control fetuses at 139-141 dga. contrary to our hypothesis, in addition to pnmt, adrenomedullary expression (mrna, protein) of tyrosine hydroxylase (th) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh) were reduced in the lth fetus. immunocytochemistry indicated that th and dbh expression was lower throughout the medulla, while pnmt appeared to reflect a reduction in pnmt-expressing cells. nicotinic receptor alpha 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, beta 1, 2, and 4 subunits were expressed in the medulla of lth and control fetuses. messenger rna for alpha 1 and 7 and beta 1 and 2 subunits was lower in lth fetuses. muscarinic receptors m1, m2, and m3 as well as the gr were also expressed, and no differences were noted between groups. in summary, lth in fetal sheep has a profound effect on expression of key enzymes mediating adrenomedullary catecholamine synthesis. further, lth impacts nicotinic receptor subunit expression potentially altering cholinergic neurotransmission within the medulla. these findings have important implications regarding fetal cardiovascular and metabolic responses to stress in the lth fetus.
initial stop voicing in bilingual children with cochlear implants and their typically developing peers with normal hearing. purpose common wisdom suggests that listening in noise poses disproportionately greater difficulty for listeners with cochlear implants (cis) than for peers with normal hearing (nh). the purpose of this study was to examine phonological, language, and cognitive skills that might help explain speech-in-noise abilities for children with cis.   method three groups of kindergartners (nh, hearing aid wearers, and ci users) were tested on speech recognition in quiet and noise and on tasks thought to underlie the abilities that fit into the domains of phonological awareness, general language, and cognitive skills. these last measures were used as predictor variables in regression analyses with speech-in-noise scores as dependent variables.   results compared to children with nh, children with cis did not perform as well on speech recognition in noise or on most other measures, including recognition in quiet. two surprising results were that (a) noise effects were consistent across groups and (b) scores on other measures did not explain any group differences in speech recognition.   conclusions limitations of implant processing take their primary toll on recognition in quiet and account for poor speech recognition and language/phonological deficits in children with cis. implications are that teachers/clinicians need to teach language/phonology directly and maximize signal-to-noise levels in the classroom.
variation in grafted european chestnut and hybrids by microsatellites reveals two main origins in the iberian peninsula allozyme genetic variability in three chestnut (castanea) species was investigated using 19 loci from ten enzyme systems. g-tests of heterogeneity of isozymic allele distribution showed significant differences between the three species at 15 of the 19 loci, and between the 13 c. mollissima populations at 13 of the 19 loci examined. c. mollissima was found to possess a significantly-higher value of mean gene heterozygosity (h=0.3050±0.0419), the percentage of polymorphic loci (p=84.21%) and the average number of alleles per locus (a=2.05), than any other species in the castanea section eucastanon. when the genetic variability of populations of c. mollissima from four regions in china was investigated, the population from the changjiang river region showed a markedly higher mean gene heterozygosity (h=0.3480±0.0436) than populations from the other regions. genetic relationships among the four regions were assessed by nei's genetic identity i and standard genetic distance d. an approximately-identical distance between the population from the changjiang river region and populations from the three other regions was observed, while populations from the latter regions showed almost the same genetic distance from each other. these data, when considered with information existing prior to this study, contribute to an understanding of the possible origin and progenitor of the chestnut species.
selection of gender-marked morphemes in speech production. picture-word interference experiments conducted with italian speakers investigated how determiners are selected in noun phrase (np) production. determiner production involves the selection of a noun's syntactic features (mass or count, gender), which specify the type of determiner to be selected, and the subsequent selection of a particular phonological form (e.g., the/a in english). the research focused on the syntactic feature of gender. results repeatedly failed to replicate the gender-congruity effect in np production reported with dutch speakers (longer latencies for target-distractor noun pairs with contrasting as opposed to the same gender). it is proposed that the discrepant results reflect processing differences in lexical access in italian and dutch: the selection of determiners in italian, but not in dutch, depends on phonological properties of the word that follows it in the np. evidence consistent with this explanation was obtained in an experiment in which determiner selection in np production was hindered by conflicting phonological information in the np.
prospective cross-sectional study on faecal immunochemical tests: sex specific cut-off values to obtain equal sensitivity for colorectal cancer? background faecal occult blood tests (fobt) are faulted by low sensitivity for advanced adenomatous polyps (aap). quantified, immunochemical, haemoglobin (hb)‐specific immunochemical fobt (i‐fobt) measurements are now used for colorectal screening.
cyclin g1 is a target of mir-122a, a microrna frequently down-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. micrornas (mirnas) are an abundant class of non-coding rnas that are believed to be important in many biological processes through regulation of gene expression. the precise molecular function of mirnas in mammals is largely unknown and a better understanding will require loss-of-function studies in vivo. here we show that a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides, termed ‘antagomirs’, are efficient and specific silencers of endogenous mirnas in mice. intravenous administration of antagomirs against mir-16, mir-122, mir-192 and mir-194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding mirna levels in liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals. the silencing of endogenous mirnas by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting. the biological significance of silencing mirnas with the use of antagomirs was studied for mir-122, an abundant liver-specific mirna. gene expression and bioinformatic analysis of messenger rna from antagomir-treated animals revealed that the 3′ untranslated regions of upregulated genes are strongly enriched in mir-122 recognition motifs, whereas downregulated genes are depleted in these motifs. analysis of the functional annotation of downregulated genes specifically predicted that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would be affected by mir-122, and plasma cholesterol measurements showed reduced levels in antagomir-122-treated mice. our findings show that antagomirs are powerful tools to silence specific mirnas in vivo and may represent a therapeutic strategy for silencing mirnas in disease.
“being-in-role”: a teaching innovation to enhance empathic communication skills in medical students objective there is a dearth of empirical research on physician empathy despite its mediating role in patient-physician relationships and clinical outcomes. this study was designed to investigate the components of physician empathy, its measurement properties, and group differences in empathy scores.   method a revised version of the jefferson scale of physician empathy (with 20 likert-type items) was mailed to 1,007 physicians affiliated with the jefferson health system in the greater philadelphia region; 704 (70%) responded. construct validity, reliability of the empathy scale, and the differences on mean empathy scores by physicians' gender and specialty were examined.   results three meaningful factors emerged (perspective taking, compassionate care, and standing in the patient's shoes) to provide support for the construct validity of the empathy scale that was also found to be internally consistent with relatively stable scores over time. women scored higher than men to a degree that was nearly significant. with control for gender, psychiatrists scored a mean empathy rating that was significantly higher than that of physicians specializing in anesthesiology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, radiology, cardiovascular surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and general surgery. no significant difference was observed on empathy scores among physicians specializing in psychiatry, internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and family medicine.   conclusions empathy is a multidimensional concept that varies among physicians and can be measured with a psychometrically sound tool. implications for specialty selection and career counseling are discussed.
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from reed canary grass in paludiculture: effect of groundwater level northern peatland methane (ch4) budgets are important for global ch4 emissions. this study aims to determine the ecosystem ch4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. annually, roughly 70 ± 35% of ecosystem ch4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, p. arundinacea-mediated ch4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. despite of plant-dominant ch4 transport, net ch4 fluxes were low (– 0.005–0.016 μmol m−2 s−1) and annually less than 1% of the annual c-co2 assimilation. this is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased ch4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. this study shows that although ch4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than co2, is emitted from this p. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the c sequestered counterbalances the ch4 emissions to the atmosphere. it is concluded that p. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive c-sequestration ecosystem.
genetic alterations in main candidate genes during melanoma progression considering that nodular melanoma (nm) has the potential to show an early distant metastasis, there is an urgent need for the discovery and evaluation of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. we aimed to investigate the protein expression of membrane and nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), cyclin d1, and the corresponding gene status in nm samples and correlate the results obtained with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival of patients. immunohistochemical and fluorescence in-situ hybridization analyses were carried out on tissue microarrays constructed from 110 nm samples, 30 compound nevi, and 38 dysplastic nevi. nm samples showed 24% strong cyclin d1 and 37% strong ki67 protein expression compared with 3 and 0% strong cyclin d1 and ki67 expression in the control group. membrane egfr expression was detected in 50% of nm cases, whereas egfr gene amplification was detected in only 4% of nm cases. multiple nm samples presented simultaneous membrane and nuclear egfr expression. we found a negative correlation between tumor thickness and membrane egfr expression. it was also observed that membrane egfr 3+ nm samples presented ulceration significantly more often than membrane egfr-negative (0) nm samples. in univariate analysis, carried out on 44 patients with follow-up data, both nuclear and membrane egfr overexpression showed a correlation with a shorter overall survival. nuclear egfr (++, +++) showed 3.06 and membrane egfr (2+, 3+) showed 2.76 higher risk of mortality compared with patients with low and negative nuclear and membrane egfr expression (p<0.05).
distinctive abnormalities of motor axonal strength-duration properties in multifocal motor neuropathy and in motor neurone disease. the strength-duration time constant (tau sd) is a property of nodal membrane and, while it depends on a number of factors, its measurement may shed light on axonal properties when taken in conjunction with measurements of axonal excitability. for example, tau sd increases with demyelination as the exposed membrane is enlarged by inclusion of paranodal and internodal membrane, it decreases with hyperpolarization and it increases with depolarization. the present study was undertaken in 20 normal volunteers to compare strength-duration curves for compound sensory and muscle action potentials, to determine the most appropriate curve fitting equation for the data, and to examine the reproducibility of the calculated time constant on different days, for potentials of different amplitude and at different sites along the nerve. using a computerized threshold-tracking system, stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce an antidromic compound sensory action potential (csap) or an orthodromic muscle action potential of 30% of maximum. stimulus duration was increased every minute in 20 microseconds steps from 20 microseconds to 1 ms. the time constant for compound sensory potentials (665 +/- 182 microsecond) was longer than that for compound emg potentials (459 +/- 126 microseconds). weiss's formula, which relates threshold charge to stimulus duration, provided an accurate fit for the experimental data, and the study validated that, using it, relatively few experimental measurements were required to calculate the time constant. in repeated studies on the same subject, time constants usually differed by < 400 microseconds for sensory axons and < 250 microseconds for motor axons. they were identical at different sites along the nerve and did not alter with the size of the compound action potential. these characteristics suggest that the determinations of strength-duration time constant could be suitable for clinical usage.
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene mutation is associated with prognosis in clinical low-grade gliomas background: mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (idh1 and idh2) have been implicated in tumorigenesis of gliomas. patients with high-grade astrocytomas with idh1 or idh2 mutations were reported to have a better survival, but it is unknown if this improved survival also holds for low-grade astrocytoma and whether these mutations predict outcome to specific treatment. methods: we retrospectively investigated the correlation of idh1 and idh2 mutations with overall survival and response to temozolomide in a cohort of patients with dedifferentiated low-grade astrocytomas treated with temozolomide at the time of progression after radiotherapy. results: idh1 mutations were present in 86% of the 49 progressive astrocytomas. no mutations in idh2 were found. presence of idh1 mutations were early events and significantly improved overall survival (median survival 48 vs 98 months), but did not affect outcome of temozolomide treatment. conclusion: these results indicate that idh1 mutations identify a subgroup of gliomas with an improved survival, but are unrelated to the temozolomide response.
nmda and dopamine converge on the nmda-receptor to induce erk activation and synaptic depression in mature hippocampus both acute and chronic changes in ampa receptor (ampar) localization are critical for synaptic formation, maturation, and plasticity. here i report that ampars are differentially sorted between recycling and degradative pathways following endocytosis. ampar sorting occurs in early endosomes and is regulated by synaptic activity and activation of ampa and nmda receptors. ampar intemalization triggered by nmdar activation is ca2+-dependent, requires protein phosphatases, and is followed by rapid membrane reinsertion. furthermore, nmdar-mediated ampar trafficking is regulated by pka and accompanied by dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation of glur1 subunits at a pka site. in contrast, activation of ampars without nmdar activation targets ampars to late endosomes and lysosomes, independent of ca2+, protein phosphatases, or pka. these results demonstrate that activity regulates ampar endocytic sorting, providing a potential mechanistic link between rapid and chronic changes in synaptic strength.
convergence and stability analysis for implicit simulations of stochastic differential equations with random jump magnitudes a class of implicit methods is introduced for ito stochastic differential equations with poisson-driven jumps. a convergence proof shows that these implicit methods share the same finite time strong convergence rate as the explicit euler–maruyama scheme. a mean-square linear stability analysis shows that implicitness offers benefits, and a natural analogue of mean-square a-stability is studied. weak variants are also considered and their stability analyzed.
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associated with gallstones in females rather than males: a longitudinal cohort study in chinese urban population background:  insulin resistance is a risk factors for non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) and for gallstone disease (gd). aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with gd in unselected patients with nafld.
regulatory t cells modulate inflammation and reduce infarct volume in experimental brain ischaemia background— cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes are key regulators of postischemic neovascularization. t-cell activation is promoted by 2 major costimulatory signalings, the b7/cd28 and cd40–cd40 ligand pathways. interestingly, cd28 interactions with the structurally related ligands b7-1 and b7-2 are also required for the generation and homeostasis of cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells (treg cells), which play a critical role in the suppression of immune responses and the control of t-cell homeostasis. we hypothesized that treg cell activation may modulate the immunoinflammatory response to ischemic injury, leading to alteration of postischemic vessel growth. methods and results— ischemia was induced by right femoral artery ligation in cd28-, b7-1/2–, or cd40-deficient mice (n=10 per group). cd40 deficiency led to a significant reduction in the postischemic inflammatory response and vessel growth. in contrast, at day 21 after ischemia, angiographic score, foot perfusion, and capillary density were increased by 2.0-, 1.2-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, in cd28-deficient mice, which showed a profound reduction in the number of treg cells compared with controls. similarly, disruption of b7-1/2 signaling or anti-cd25 treatment and subsequent treg deletion significantly enhanced postischemic neovascularization. these effects were associated with enhanced accumulation of cd3-positive t cells and mac-3–positive macrophages in the ischemic leg. conversely, treatment of cd28−/− mice with the nonmitogenic anti-cd3 monoclonal antibody enhanced the number of endogenous treg cells and led to a significant reduction of the postischemic inflammatory response and neovascularization. finally, coadministration of treg cells and cd28−/− splenocytes in rag1−/− mice with hindlimb ischemia abrogated the cd28−/− splenocyte-induced activation of the inflammatory response and neovascularization. conclusion— treg cell response modulates postischemic neovascularization.
qualitative differences in offline improvement of procedural memory by daytime napping and overnight sleep: an fmri study growing evidence indicates a role for sleep in off-line memory processing, specifically in post-training consolidation. in humans, sleep has been shown to trigger overnight learning on a motor-sequence memory task, while equivalent waking periods produce no such improvement. but while the behavioral characteristics of sleep-dependent motor learning become increasingly well characterized, the underlying neural basis remains unknown. here we present functional magnetic resonance imaging data demonstrating a change in the representation of a motor memory after a night of sleep. subjects trained on a motor-skill memory and 12 hours later, after either sleep or wake, were retested during functional magnetic resonance imaging. following sleep relative to wake, regions of increased activation were expressed in the right primary motor cortex, medial prefrontal lobe, hippocampus and left cerebellum; changes that can support faster motor output and more precise mapping of key-press movements. in contrast, signal decreases were identified in parietal cortices, the left insular cortex, temporal pole and fronto-polar region, reflecting a reduced need for conscious spatial monitoring and a decreased emotional task burden. this evidence of an overnight, systems-level change in the representation of a motor memory holds important implications for acquiring real-life skills and in clinical rehabilitation following brain trauma, such as stroke.
genetic relationship between lactation curve traits in the first three parities of dairy cattle the objective of this study was to investigate the phenotypic relationship between common health disorders in dairy cows and lactation persistency, uncorrelated with 305-d yield. the relationships with peak yield and days in milk (dim) at peak were also studied. daily milk weights and treatment incidence records of 991 holstein lactations from experimental dairy herds at virginia tech and pennsylvania state university were used. persistency was calculated as a function of daily yield deviations from standard lactation curves, developed separately for first (fl) and later lactations (ll), and deviations of dim around reference dates: 128 for fl and 125 for ll. days in milk at peak and peak yield were computed for each lactation by using wood's function. the disease traits studied were mastitis (mast) only during the first 100 d (mast1), only after 100 dim (mast2), both before and after 100 dim (mast12), and at any stage of lactation (mast1/2), as well as metritis, displaced abomasums, lameness, and metabolic diseases. each disease was defined as a binary trait, distinguishing between lactations with at least one incidence (1) and lactations with no incidences (0). the relationships of diseases to persistency, dim at peak, and peak yield were investigated separately for fl and ll for all disease traits except mast12, which was investigated across parities. the relationships of persistency to probability of the diseases in the same lactation and in the next lactation were examined using odds ratios from a logistic regression model. metritis and displaced abomasums in fl and ll were associated with significantly higher persistencies. metabolic diseases and mast1 in ll were significantly related to higher persistencies. the relationships of mast2 in both fl and ll, and mast12 across parities were significant but negative. cows affected by mast tended to have less persistent lactations. most of the diseases had a significant impact on dim at peak in ll. in ll, metritis, metabolic diseases, and displaced abomasums tended to significantly delay dim at peak. mastitis only after 100 dim was associated with significantly earlier dim at peak in ll. increasing persistency was associated with low mast2 and mast1/2 in primiparous cows. none of the diseases studied was significantly related to persistency of the previous lactation.
chronic anti-phencyclidine monoclonal antibody therapy decreases phencyclidine-induced in utero fetal mortality in pregnant rats. the dependence-producing properties of 10 days of chronic i.v. infusions of phencyclidine (pcp) and the relationship between pcp serum concentrations and behavioral effects were studied in sprague-dawley rats. for dependence studies, rats were trained to respond for food under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule during half-hour response periods every 6 hr. after training, implantation of jugular catheters, and restabilization of behavior, the rats were infused with pcp.hcl at 3.2, 5.6, 10.0 or 17.8 mg/kg/day (n = 5 or 6 per dose). the two higher doses initially decreased response rates, but tolerance developed within 4 to 5 days. when pcp infusions were terminated, dose-dependent decreases in session response rate occurred in the three highest dose groups (p less than .05). mild, overt signs of abstinence were observed only in the highest dose group. response rates returned to base line within 2 to 3 days after stopping pcp infusions. pcp serum concentrations in rats infused with 10 mg of pcp.hcl/kg/day for 10 days were stable from hour 24 to day 10 (mean steady-state concentration (+/- s.d.) = 97 (+/- 20) ng of pcp/ml; n = 4). the average terminal elimination half-life after stopping infusions on day 10 was 4.6 hr. comparison of the average response rates with the average serum concentrations showed that during the first 24 hr of infusions, the rate of responding for food decreased as pcp concentrations increased; however, once the animals became tolerant to pcp there was no relationship. in contrast, during the first 24 hr after stopping infusions, response rates decreased as serum concentrations decreased.
molecular characterization and transcriptional regulation of the renin-angiotensin system genes in senegalese sole (solea senegalensis kaup, 1858): differential gene regulation by salinity. angiotensinogen (agt) is the precursor of the renin-angiotensin system and contributes to osmoregulation, acute-phase and immune responses. a full-length cdna of the agt (2004 bp with a 1389 bp coding region) was isolated from rock bream (rb), oplegnathus fasciatus. the encoded polypeptide of 463 amino acids had a predicted molecular mass of 51.6 kda. rbagt possessed a deduced signal peptide of 22 residues upstream of a putative angiotensin i sequence ((23)nrvyvhpfhl(32)). rbagt possessed a specific domain profile and a signature motif which are characteristics of the serpin family. sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that rbagt was evolutionarily closest to agt of rhabdosargus sarba. the mrna expression profile of rbagt was determined by quantitative rt-pcr and it demonstrated a constitutive and tissue-specific expression with the highest transcript level in the liver. significantly up-regulated rbagt expression was elicited by systemic injection of a lipopolysaccharide, rock bream iridovirus (rbiv) and bacteria (edwardsiella tarda and streptococcus iniae), revealing its pathogen inducibility. rbagt manifested a down-regulated response to systemic injury, contemporaneously with two other serpins, protease nexin-1 (pn-1), and heparin cofactor ii (hcii). in addition, a synchronized expression pattern was elicited by rbagt and rbtnf-α in response to injury, suggesting that tnf-α might be a potential modulator of agt transcription.
early outcome data assessing utility of a post-test genomic counseling framework for the scalable delivery of precision health there has been very limited study of patients with chronic disease receiving potentially actionable genomic based results or the utilization of genetic counselors in the online result delivery process. we conducted a randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age = 57.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. in contrast, control arm participants (n = 101; mean age = 58.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. a total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. we found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. in conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. these results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.
integrative rna-seq and microarray data analysis reveals gc content and gene length biases in the psoriasis transcriptome. next-generation sequencing (ngs) has caused a revolution in biology. ngs requires the preparation of libraries in which (fragments of) dna or rna molecules are fused with adapters followed by pcr amplification and sequencing. it is evident that robust library preparation methods that produce a representative, non-biased source of nucleic acid material from the genome under investigation are of crucial importance. nevertheless, it has become clear that ngs libraries for all types of applications contain biases that compromise the quality of ngs datasets and can lead to their erroneous interpretation. a detailed knowledge of the nature of these biases will be essential for a careful interpretation of ngs data on the one hand and will help to find ways to improve library quality or to develop bioinformatics tools to compensate for the bias on the other hand. in this review we discuss the literature on bias in the most common ngs library preparation protocols, both for dna sequencing (dna-seq) as well as for rna sequencing (rna-seq). strikingly, almost all steps of the various protocols have been reported to introduce bias, especially in the case of rna-seq, which is technically more challenging than dna-seq. for each type of bias we discuss methods for improvement with a view to providing some useful advice to the researcher who wishes to convert any kind of raw nucleic acid into an ngs library.
osmolarity and glucose differentially regulate aldose reductase activity in cultured mouse podocytes podocytes possess the complete machinery for glutamatergic signaling, raising the possibility that neuron-like signaling contributes to glomerular function. to test this, we studied mice and cells lacking rab3a, a small gtpase that regulates glutamate exocytosis. in addition, we blocked the glutamate ionotropic n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) with specific antagonists. in mice, the absence of rab3a and blockade of nmdar both associated with an increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. in humans, nmdar blockade, obtained by addition of ketamine to general anesthesia, also had an albuminuric effect. in vitro, rab3a-null podocytes displayed a dysregulated release of glutamate with higher rates of spontaneous exocytosis, explained by a reduction in rab3a effectors resulting in freedom of vesicles from the actin cytoskeleton. in addition, nmdar antagonism led to profound cytoskeletal remodeling and redistribution of nephrin in cultured podocytes; the addition of the agonist nmda reversed these changes. in summary, these results suggest that glutamatergic signaling driven by podocytes contributes to the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and that derangements in this signaling may lead to proteinuric renal diseases.
pinto bean hull extract supplementation favorably affects markers of bone metabolism and bone structure in mice the objective of this study was to characterize the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of u.s.-produced cool season legumes. a total of 33 cool season legume samples were selected. some common beans and soybeans were included for comparisons. total phenolic content (tpc), total flavonoid content (tfc), and condensed tannin content (ctc) were analyzed. ferric reducing antioxidant power (frap), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging assay, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac) were used for analyzing antioxidant properties. color of the legume flour and the seed coat was also analyzed. tpc, tfc, ctc, frap, dpph, and orac values of legumes were significantly different not only between classes but also among samples within each class. among cool season legume classes, lentils possessed the highest concentrations of the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities. colored common beans and black soybeans exhibited higher tpc, tfc, ctc, frap, dpph, and orac values than those of yellow peas, green peas, and chickpeas. antioxidant activities (frap, dpph, and orac) were strongly correlated (r= 0.96, 0.94, and 0.89, respectively, p < 0.01) with tpc. tpc and orac were moderately correlated (p < 0.01) with either the seed hull surface color or the flour color.
expanded gene panel use for women with breast cancer: identification and intervention beyond breast cancer risk background advances in next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies are driving a shift from single-gene to multigene panel testing for clinical genetic cancer risk assessment (gcra). this study explored perceptions, experiences, and challenges with ngs testing for gcra among u.s. community-based clinicians.   methods surveys delivered at initial and 8-month time points, and 12-month tracking of cases presented in a multidisciplinary web-based case conference series, were conducted with gcra providers who participated in a 235-member nationwide community of practice.   results the proportion of respondents ordering panel tests rose from 29% at initial survey (27/94) to 44% (46/107) within 8 months. respondents reported significantly less confidence about interpreting and counseling about ngs compared with single-gene test results (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). the most cited reasons for not ordering ngs tests included concerns about clinical utility, interpreting and communicating results, and lack of knowledge/skills. multigene panels were used in 204/668 cases presented during 2013, yielding 37 (18%) deleterious (7% in low/moderate-penetrance genes), 88 (43%) with ≥1 variant of uncertain significance, 77 (38%) uninformative negative, and 2 (1%) inconclusive results.   conclusions despite concerns about utility and ability to interpret/counsel about ngs results, a rapidly increasing uptake of ngs testing among community clinicians was documented. challenges identified in case discussions point to the need for ongoing education, practice-based support, and opportunities to partner in research that contributes to characterization of lesser known genes.
fifteen-year trauma system performance analysis demonstrates optimal coverage for most severely injured patients and identifies a vulnerable population. background the injury severity score (iss) has served as the standard summary measure of human trauma for 20 years. despite its stalwart service, the iss has two weaknesses: it relies upon the consensus derived severity estimates for each abbreviated injury scale (ais) injury and considers, at most, only three of an individual patient's injuries, three injuries that often are not even the patient's most severe injuries. additionally, the iss requires that all patients have their injuries described in the ais lexicon, an expensive step that is currently taken only at hospitals with a zealous commitment to trauma care. we hypothesized that a data driven alternative to iss that used empirically derived injury severities and considered all of an individual patient's injuries would more accurately predict survival.   methods survival risk ratios were derived for every international classification of disease 9th edition (icd-9) injury category (800-959.9) using the north carolina state discharge database experience with 300,000 trauma patients over 5 years. an icd-9 injury severity score (iciss) was then defined as the product of all survival risk ratios for an individual patient's traumatic icd-9 codes. we compared the performance of iss and iciss in a group of 3,142 patients accrued at the university of new mexico trauma center over 4 years. these patients had both ais and icd-9 descriptors meticulously assigned prospectively by designated trauma data base personnel.   results iciss outperformed iss at a level that was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001) and may be clinically important: iss misclassification rate 7.67%, iss receiver operator characteristic curve area = 0.872; iciss misclassification rate 5.95%, iciss receiver operator characteristic curve area = 0.921. moreover, these improvements are largely preserved when iciss is used in a probability of survival model that includes age, mechanism, and revised trauma score. about half of iciss's improvement in predictive power is because of its use of an individual patient's worst three injuries regardless of body region. the remainder is because of better modeling of individual injuries and allowing all injuries to contribute to the final score.   conclusions we conclude that iciss is a much better predictor of survival than iss in injured patients. the use of the icd-9 lexicon may avoid the need for ais coding, and thus may add an economic incentive to the statistical appeal of iciss. it is possible that a similar data driven revision of iss using the ais vocabulary might perform as well or better than iciss. indeed, the actual lexicon used to divide up the injury "landscape" into individual injuries may be of little consequence so long as all injuries are considered and empirically derived srrs are used to calculate the final injury measure.
arabian sea response to monsoon variations variations in the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth are thought to influence climate, but the extent of this influence on timescales of millennia to decades is unclear. a number of climate records show correlations between solar cycles and climate, but the absolute changes in solar intensity over the range of decades to millennia are small and the influence of solar flux on climate is not well established. the formation of stalagmites in northern oman has recorded past northward shifts of the intertropical convergence zone, whose northward migration stops near the southern shoreline of arabia in the present climate. here we present a high-resolution record of oxygen isotope variations, for the period from 9.6 to 6.1 kyr before present, in a th–u-dated stalagmite from oman. the δ18o record from the stalagmite, which serves as a proxy for variations in the tropical circulation and monsoon rainfall, allows us to make a direct comparison of the δ18o record with the δ14c record from tree rings, which largely reflects changes in solar activity. the excellent correlation between the two records suggests that one of the primary controls on centennial- to decadal-scale changes in tropical rainfall and monsoon intensity during this time are variations in solar radiation.
caveolae-associated proteins in cardiomyocytes: caveolin-2 expression and interactions with caveolin-3. differential modes for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (ar) regulation of adenylyl cyclase in cardiomyocytes is most consistent with spatial regulation in microdomains of the plasma membrane. this study examines whether caveolae represent specialized subdomains that concentrate and organize these moieties in cardiomyocytes. caveolae from quiescent rat ventricular cardiomyocytes are highly enriched in beta(2)-ars, galpha(i), protein kinase a riialpha subunits, caveolin-3, and flotillins (caveolin functional homologues); beta(1)-ars, m(2)-muscarinic cholinergic receptors, galpha(s), and cardiac types v/vi adenylyl cyclase distribute between caveolae and other cell fractions, whereas protein kinase a rialpha subunits, g protein-coupled receptor kinase-2, and clathrin are largely excluded from caveolae. cell surface beta(2)-ars localize to caveolae in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (with markedly different beta(2)-ar expression levels), indicating that the fidelity of beta(2)-ar targeting to caveolae is maintained over a physiologic range of beta(2)-ar expression. in cardiomyocytes, agonist stimulation leads to a marked decline in the abundance of beta(2)-ars (but not beta(1)-ars) in caveolae. other studies show co-immunoprecipitation of cardiomyocytes adenylyl cyclase v/vi and caveolin-3, suggesting their in vivo association. however, caveolin is not required for adenylyl cyclase targeting to low density membranes, since adenylyl cyclase targets to low buoyant density membrane fractions of hek cells that lack prototypical caveolins. nevertheless, cholesterol depletion with cyclodextrin augments agonist-stimulated camp accumulation, indicating that caveolae function as negative regulators of camp accumulation. the inhibitory interaction between caveolae and the camp signaling pathway as well as domain-specific differences in the stoichiometry of individual elements in the beta-ar signaling cascade represent important modifiers of camp-dependent signaling in the heart.
muscarinic activation of ca2+‐activated cl− current in interstitial cells of cajal evidence showing that interstitial cells of cajal have important regulatory functions in the gut musculature is accumulating. in the current study, the ultrastructure of the deep muscular plexus and associated interstial cells of cajal in human small intestine were studied to provide a reference for identification and further physiological or pathological studies. the deep muscular plexus was sandwiched between a thin inner layer of smooth muscle (one to five cells thick) and the bulk of the circular muscle. interstitial cells of cajal in this region very much resembled smooth muscle cells (with a continuous basal lamina, caveolae, intermediate filaments, dense bodies, dense bands, and a well-developed subsurface smooth endoplasmic reticulum), but the arrangement of organelles was clearly different, and cisternae of granular endoplasmic reticulum were abundant. interstitial cells of cajal were distinguished from fibroblasts or macrophages in the region. they ramified in the inner zone of the outer division of circular muscle, penetrated the inner-most circular layer, and were also found at the submucosal border. they were in close, synapselike contact with nerve terminals of the deep muscular plexus, and only few gap junctions with other interstitial cells of cajal or with the musculature were observed. compared with interstitial cells of cajal from other mammals, those associated with the deep muscular plexus in the human small intestine more closely resemble smooth muscle cells, and their organization appears more diffuse; however, the ultrastructure and organization of interstitial cells of cajal is compatible with modulatory actions on the circular muscle also in humans.
on the tradeoff of average delay and average power for fading point-to-point links with monotone policies we consider the fundamental delay tradeoffs for utility optimal scheduling in a general network with time-varying channels. a network controller acts on randomly arriving data and makes flow control, routing, and resource allocation decisions to maximize a fairness metric based on a concave utility function of network throughput. a simple set of algorithms are constructed that yield total utility within o(1/v) of the utility-optimal operating point, for any control parameter v>0, with a corresponding end-to-end network delay that grows only logarithmically in v. this is the first algorithm to achieve such "super-fast" performance. furthermore, we show that this is the best utility-delay tradeoff possible. this work demonstrates that the problem of maximizing throughput utility in a data network is fundamentally different than related problems of minimizing average power expenditure, as these latter problems cannot achieve such performance tradeoffs
the role of subjective factors in the information search process this study examined the success and information seeking behaviors of seventh-grade science students and graduate students in information science in using yahooligans! web search engine/directory. it investigated these users' cognitive, affective, and physical behaviors as they sought the answer for a fact-finding task. it analyzed and compared the overall patterns of children's and graduate students' web activities, including searching moves, browsing moves, backtracking moves, looping moves, screen scrolling, target location and deviation moves, and the time they took to complete the task. the authors applied bilal's web traversal measure to quantify these users' effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of moves they made. results were based on 14 children's web sessions and nine graduate students' sessions. both groups' web activities were captured online using lotus screencam, a software package that records and replays online activities in web browsers. children's affective states were captured via exit interviews. graduate students' affective states were extracted from the journal writings they kept during the traversal process. the study findings reveal that 89% of the graduate students found the correct answer to the search task as opposed to 50% of the children. based on the measure, graduate students' weighted effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of the web moves they made were much higher than those of the children. regardless of success and weighted scores, however, similarities and differences in information seeking were found between the two groups. yahooligans! poor structure of keyword searching was a major factor that contributed to the "breakdowns" children and graduate students experienced. unlike children, graduate students were able to recover from "breakdowns" quickly and effectively. three main factors influenced these users' performance: ability to recover from "breakdowns", navigational style, and focus on task. children and graduate students made recommendations for improving yahooligans! interface design. implications for web user training and system design improvements are made.
dual therapy with liraglutide and ghrelin promotes brain and peripheral energy metabolism in the r6/2 mouse model of huntington’s disease huntington's disease (hd) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease selectively leading to striatal neurodegeneration, but also affecting the cortex and the hypothalamus. although it is hard to predict the sequence of cell-damaging events occurring in hd patients, several pathological mechanisms have been proposed to explain hd selective neurodegeneration and disease symptomatology. abnormalities in mitochondrial function and bioenergetics contribute to cell death and have been reported in hd-affected individuals, both in central and peripheral tissues. moreover, the latter has been characterized in several hd models. thus, this review describes the converging mechanisms that lead to mitochondrial and metabolic abnormalities in thoroughly studied in vivo and in vitro hd models, including excitotoxicity, altered calcium handling, changes in mitochondrial structure and dynamics and transcription deregulation, which may represent important disease therapeutic targets. furthermore, the review describes the current evidences of metabolic disturbances in the brain of hd-affected humans and of peripheral metabolic and mitochondrial changes, weight loss and endocrine abnormalities operating in the whole hd body.
neural basis of reward anticipation and its genetic determinants a review of the existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies on reward anticipation in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is provided. meta-analysis showed a significant medium effect size (cohen's d=0.48-0.58) in terms of ventral-striatal (vs)-hyporesponsiveness in adhd. studies on vs-responsiveness and trait impulsivity in the healthy population demonstrate the opposite relationship, i.e. impulsivity-scores positively correlated with vs activation during reward processing. against the background that adhd may represent an extreme on a continuum of normal variability, the question arises as to how these contrasting findings can be integrated. we discuss three theoretical approaches, each of which integrates the opposing findings: (1) an inverted-u-shape model; (2) a (genetic) moderator model; and (3) the "unrelated model". we conclude that at the present stage the number of existing studies in the healthy population as well as in adhd groups is too small for a final answer. therefore, our presented integrative approaches should be understood as an attempt to frame future research directions by generating testable hypotheses and giving practical suggestions for future studies.
sex-specific effects of placental restriction on components of the metabolic syndrome in young adult sheep. several studies have linked low birth weight (lbw) and type 2 diabetes. we investigated hepatic and peripheral insulin action including intracellular glucose metabolism in 40 19-year-old men (20 lbw, 20 matched control subjects), using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique at two physiological insulin levels (10 and 40 mu/m(2) per min), indirect calorimetry, and [3-(3)h]glucose. insulin secretion was examined during an oral and intravenous glucose tolerance test. fasting p-glucose was higher in the lbw group (5.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.1; p < 0.05). basal plasma glycerol concentrations were significantly lower in the lbw group. insulin-stimulated glycolytic flux was significantly reduced, and suppression of endogenous glucose production was enhanced in the lbw group. nevertheless, basal and insulin-stimulated rates of whole-body peripheral glucose disposal, glucose oxidation, lipid oxidation, exogenous glucose storage, and nonoxidative glucose metabolism were similar in the two groups. insulin secretion was reduced by 30% in the lbw group, when expressed relative to insulin sensitivity (disposition index = insulin secretion x insulin action). we propose that reduced insulin-stimulated glycolysis precedes overt insulin resistance in lbw men. a lower insulin secretion may contribute to impaired glucose tolerance and ultimately lead to diabetes.
feasibility of promoting smoking cessation among methadone users using multimedia computer-assisted education the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a web-based computer-assisted education (co-ed) system versus searching the internet for learning about hypertension. twenty-two older adults (age 45+) in baltimore, md were enrolled. analysis of pre- and post- knowledge scores indicates a significant (15%) improvement among co-ed users as opposed to internet users.
the nob2 mouse, a null mutation in cacna1f: anatomical and functional abnormalities in the outer retina and their consequences on ganglion cell visual responses. purpose the cacna1f gene encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel alpha1 subunit, alpha1f, which is expressed in the human retina. mutations in this gene cause incomplete x-linked congenital stationary night blindness (csnb2). the aim of this study was to obtain the sequence of the rat alpha1f cdna and localize the encoded polypeptide in the rat retina.   methods the full-length rat alpha1f sequence was compiled from sequencing of overlapping alpha1f pcr fragments amplified from rat retinal cdna. antiserum was raised against a human alpha1f peptide. it was found that the human alpha1f peptide used to generate the antiserum was conserved at only 11 out of 19 residues in the cloned rat sequence. therefore, antibodies were affinity purified against either the human alpha1f peptide or the equivalent rat peptide and used for immunofluorescent staining of rat retina sections.   results the rat alpha1f amino acid sequence was found to be 91% and 95% identical to the human and mouse alpha1f sequences, respectively. antibodies affinity purified against the human alpha1f peptide stained both the outer nuclear layer (onl) and outer plexiform layer of rat retina sections. in contrast, staining with antibodies affinity purified against the corresponding rat alpha1f peptide was restricted to the onl.   conclusions the rat alpha1f amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the human and mouse sequences. the immunohistochemical results indicate the existence of distinct alpha1f isoforms or alpha1f-like channels, which are differentially distributed in the cell bodies and synaptic terminals of photoreceptors in the rat retina.
activation and function of tgfβ signalling during drosophila wing development and its interactions with the bmp pathway. the transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) superfamily encompasses a large group of soluble extracellular proteins that are potent regulators of development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. drosophila tgf-beta family members include three proteins with homology to vertebrate bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps): decapentaplegic (dpp), screw, and glass bottom boat-60a. genetic studies of dpp signaling led to the identification of smad proteins as central mediators of signal transduction by tgf-beta family members. work in mammalian tissue culture has elucidated a biochemical model for signal transduction, in which activation of receptor serine-threonine kinase activity leads to phosphorylation of specific smad proteins and translocation of heteromeric smad protein complexes to the nucleus. once in the nucleus smad proteins interact with other dna binding proteins to regulate transcription of specific target genes. dissection of dpp-response elements from genes expressed during embryonic mesoderm patterning and midgut morphogenesis provides important insights into the contributions of smad proteins and tissue-specific transcription factors to spatial regulation of gene expression. genetic studies in drosophila are now expanding to include multiple bmp ligands and receptors and have uncovered activities not explained by the current signal transduction model. identification of more ligand sequences and demonstration of a functional drosophila activin-like signal transduction pathway suggest that all tgf-beta signal transduction pathways are present in flies.
a disturbance-induced increase in tree species diversity facilitates forest productivity disturbance has many effects on ecological communities, and it is often suggested that disturbance can affect species diversity by altering competitive outcomes. however, disturbance regimes have many distinct aspects that may act, and interact, to influence species diversity. while there are many theoretical models of disturbance-prone communities, few have specifically documented how interactions between different aspects of a disturbance regime change competitive outcomes. here, we present a model of two plant species subject to disturbance which we then use to examine species coexistence over varying levels of two aspects of disturbance: frequency, and spatial extent (i.e., area disturbed). we show that the competitive outcome is affected differently by changes in each aspect and that the effect of disturbance frequency on species coexistence depends strongly on the spatial extent of the disturbance, and vice versa. we classify the nature of these interactions between disturbance frequency and extent on the basis of the shape of the resulting coexistence regions in a frequency–extent parameter plane. our results illustrate that different types of interaction can result from differences in life-history traits that control species-specific sensitivity to frequency and extent of disturbance. thus, our analysis shows that the various aspects of disturbance must be carefully considered in concert with the life-history traits of the community members in order to assess the consequences of disturbance.
characteristics of human cortical pyramidal neuron development during the second gestational trimester information about development of the human cerebral cortex (proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons) is largely based on postmortem histology. physiological properties of developing human cortical neurons are difficult to access experimentally and therefore remain largely unexplored. animal studies have shown that information about the arousal of electrical activity in individual cells within fundamental cortical zones (subventricular zone [svz], intermediate zone, subplate [sp], and cortical plate [cp]) is necessary for understanding normal brain development. here we ask where, in what cortical zone, and when, in what gestational week (gw), human neurons acquire the ability to generate nerve impulses (action potentials [aps]). we performed electrical recordings from individual cells in acute brain slices harvested postmortem from the human fetal cerebral cortex (16-22 gw). tetrodotoxin-sensitive na(+) current occurs more frequently among cp cells and with significantly greater peak amplitudes than in svz. as early as 16 gw, a relatively small population of cp neurons (27%) was able to generate sodium aps upon direct current injection. neurons located in the sp exhibited the highest level of cellular differentiation, as judged by their ability to fire repetitive aps. at 19 gw, a fraction of human cp and sp neurons possess beta iv spectrin-positive axon initial segments populated with voltage-gated sodium channels (pannav). these results yield the first physiological characterization of developing human fetal cortical neurons with preserved morphologies in intact surrounding brain tissue.
comparison of the effects of calmidazolium, morphine and bupivacaine on n-methyl-d-aspartate- and septide-induced nociceptive behaviour intrathecal injection of substance p produced a behavioural syndrome, consisting of reciproacal hindlimb scratching and biting or fore- and hind-licking. pretreatment with either an analogue of substance p, (d-pro2, d-trp7,9)-substance p (dpdt-sp) or (d-arg1, d-pro2,4, d-trp7,9, leu11)-substance p, given intrathecally, reduced the response to substance p in a dose-dependent manner. the behaviour induced by substance p was also inhibited by intrathecal, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of morphine. intrathecal or subcutaneous injection of naloxone showed a biphasic effect on substance p response; the substance p-induced nociceptive response was increased by a small dose of naloxone, while it was inversely decreased by a large dose of naloxone. the results with analogues of substance p support the hypothesis that substance p, injected intrathecally, acts directly on substance p receptors in the spinal cord. the nociceptive response induced by substance p appears to be controlled by endogenous opioids in the spinal cord.
squash cytomorphology of central neurocytoma: a study of five cases background central neurocytomas are rare brain tumors recognized by their typical radiologic and histologic features. in general, a good prognosis is achieved by total removal. the histogenesis is still under debate, but a neuronal origin is widely assumed.   methods this study presents the clinical and immunohistologic findings of five patients and the results of cell culture experiments of two patients with central neurocytoma treated surgically between 1983 and 1993.   results the patient age at diagnosis ranged from 21 to 30 years (mean, 25 years). the male-to-female ration was 1:4. raised intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus was the main cause of the clinical manifestations. total resection was achieved in two cases. four patients received radiotherapy. one patient suffered a recurrence 1 year after surgery, requiring a second resection and radiotherapy. follow-up studies took place between 1 and 10.5 years (mean, 7.1 years). to date, all patients are free of their tumors. two patients suffered from permanent memory disturbances after surgery. immunohistochemistry confirmed the neuronal nature of the tumors. cell-culture studies, which have been carried out for the first time, demonstrated concomitant expression of neuronal (synaptophysin) and glial (gfap) markers.   conclusion total removal is the therapy of choice. in tumor recurrence or limited surgery (e.g. due to severe affliction of the fornical structures), radiotherapy has shown to be efficacious. the cell-culture experiments give new insight on the histogenesis of central neurocytoma, indicating that the tumor arises from an undifferentiated precursor cell with the capacity of bipotential neuroglial differentiation.
mitogenic action of the androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to taxane-based cytotoxic insult. purpose the purpose is to identify gene expression patterns induced by docetaxelin head and neck squamous carcinoma (hnscc) cells using high throughput techniques.   experimental design hnscc cells were treated with docetaxel or solvent. after mrna extraction, cdna fluorescent (cy3 or cy5)-labeled probes were synthesized. then, cy3 and cy5-labeled samples were hybridized onto a microarray slide. the fluorescent images were scanned and analyzed for quantification. powerblot immunoblotting technique was used to measure protein expression level. using this dual approach, we focused on genes in established pathways (cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and signal transduction) of tumorigenesis and confirmed these results with conventional techniques.   results using cdna microarray, we found that docetaxel altered the expression of >100 genes in hnscc cells. a total of 153 of 1191 genes was found to have altered expression in either hn12 (n = 102), hn30 (n = 72), or both (n = 21) by docetaxel. for the powerblot analysis, a subset of genes (n = 46) in the cdna microarray analysis and an additional 98 genes in the cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and signal transduction pathways were chosen. we found that powerblot data agreed with cdna microarray in 65% of genes examined. the expression of a cell cycle inhibitor (p19) and promoters (cyclin a, cyclin b1, and cyclin e2f) were increased and decreased, respectively. apoptosis induced by docetaxel was independent of p53 and, in part, related to increased fas expression. both vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and basic fibroblast growth factor expression were inhibited by docetaxel, whereas thrombospondin-1 expression was increased by docetaxel. epidermal growth factor receptor, activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and activated c-jun nh(2)-terminal kinase expression was lowered by docetaxel. activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase was elevated by docetaxel, but not total extracellular signal-regulated kinase levels.   conclusions the identification of altered gene expression induced by docetaxel demonstrates additional biological activity in hnscc cells, and the altered expression of these genes may serve as potential biomarkers to both predict clinical activity and provide information regarding potential efficacy of adding novel agents.
htt-lowering reverses huntington's disease immune dysfunction caused by nfκb pathway dysregulation. nature genetics advance online publication we undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (gwas) of alzheimer’s disease (ad) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful ad gwas to date. in stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein e (apoe) locus (most significant snp, rs2075650, p = 1.8 × 10−157) and observed genome-wide significant association with snps at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the clu (also known as apoj) gene (rs11136000, p = 1.4 × 10−9) and 5 to the picalm gene (rs3851179, p = 1.9 × 10−8). these associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with alzheimer’s disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, p = 8.5 × 10−10, odds ratio = 0.86; rs3851179, p = 1.3 × 10−9, odds ratio = 0.86).
the associations between pd-1, ctla-4 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis: a meta-analysis and systemic review ankylosing spondylitis (as) is an autoimmune disease, and the imbalance of peripheral tolerance is involved in its pathogenesis. importantly, the negative signal of activated t cells plays a crucial role in the balance of peripheral tolerance. it has been postulated that human protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (ptpn22) and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen-4 (ctla-4) genes encode proteins that are actively involved in regulating t-cell activation. therefore, we evaluated the effects of ptpn22 and ctla-4 genotypes on the occurrence of as. genetic polymorphisms of ptpn22 -1123g/c and ctla-4 +49a/g were identified by polymerase chain reaction for 391 as patients and 391 healthy controls. subjects with ptpn22 cc and gc genotypes had a greater risk of as occurrence than those with ptpn22 gg genotype [relative risk = 1.39, 95 % confidence interval (95 % ci) 1.03–1.88]. further, subjects with ptpn22 cc/ctla-4 aa or ptpn22 gc/ctla-4 aa genotypes had 1.90-fold (95 % ci 1.02–3.49) greater risk of as development than those with other combinations of ptpn22 and ctla-4 genotypes. our findings indicated that ptpn22 -1123g/c and ctla-4 +49a/g genetic polymorphisms have a combined effect on the development of as.
a three-dimensional finite element model of round window membrane vibration before and after stapedotomy surgery the fluids in the cochlea are normally considered incompressible, and the fluid volume displacement of the oval window (ow) and the round window (rw) should be equal and of opposite phase. however, other channels, such as the cochlear and vestibular aqueducts, may affect the fluid flow. to test if the ow and rw fluid flows are equal and of opposite phase, the volume displacement was assessed by multiple point measurement at the windows with a laser doppler vibrometer. this was done during air conduction (ac) stimulation in seven fresh human temporal bones, and with bone conduction (bc) stimulation in eight temporal bones and one human cadaver head. with ac stimulation, the average volume displacement of the two windows is within 3 db, and the phase difference is close to 180 degrees for the frequency range 0.1 to 10 khz. with bc stimulation, the average volume displacement difference between the two windows is greater: below 2 khz, the volume displacement at the rw is 5 to 15 db greater than at the ow and above 2 khz more fluid is displaced at the ow. with bc stimulation, lesions at the ow caused only minor changes of the fluid flow at the rw.
