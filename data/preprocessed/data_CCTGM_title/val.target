Such dVS/ dP changes observed above ~100 GPa have previously been interpreted to reflect the onset of the average Si-O coordination number changing from just 6 to 6+ #REF.
Most studies compare different surgical techniques and focus on the complication and recurrence rates, postoperative pain, quality of life, and late discomfort #REF.
In empirical software engineering, ethnography provides an in-depth understanding of the sociotechnical realities surrounding everyday software development practice #REF and highlights the significance of socio-technical issues in the design of software-intensive systems #OTHERREF.

Our results are consistent with those of a previous study conducted by #REF, which showed higher N2-fixation rates at early exponential phase in Trichodesmium sp. and lower rates at stationary phase.
Some of these peptides act as neurotoxins on the glutamate receptors of the central nervous system and/or in neural ion channels #REF.
Therefore, despite an apparent higher number of mean B/S days in women using the LNG-IUS for HMB compared with those using it for contraception #REF, this does not result in an increased rate of discontinuation due to bleeding problems.
According to #REF the factors that contribute to bad quality sleep include: youngsters with a higher level of education; those who live in rural areas; and those who show poorer health perception and higher levels of depression and anxiety.
