@result associations of physical activity, sedentary time, and screen time with cardiovascular fitness in united states adolescents: results from the nhanes national youth fitness survey. background during childhood and adolescence, both physical activity (pa) and sedentary behaviour seem to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (crf); however, the combined association of pa and sedentary behaviour remains to be understood. we analysed the combined association of objectively measured sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous intensity pa (mvpa) on crf in portuguese children and adolescents. methods the sample comprised 2506 portuguese healthy children and adolescents aged 10–18 years, from a cross-sectional school-based study (2008). pa and sedentary behaviour were assessed with accelerometry. participants were classified as meeting current pa guidelines for youth versus not meeting, and as low versus high sedentary (according to the median value of sedentary time/day by age and gender), and then grouped as follows: low active—high sedentary; low active—low sedentary; high active—high sedentary; high active—low sedentary. crf was assessed with the fitnessgram 20 m shuttle-run test. binary logistic regression models were constructed to verify the relationship between high crf and the combined influence of mvpa/sedentary behaviour, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and accelerometer wear time. results participants classified as high active/low sedentary (or=1.81; 95% ci 1.21 to 2.69), as well as those classified as low active/low sedentary (or=1.27; 95% ci 1.01 to 1.61) were more likely to be fit, compared with those from the low-active/high-sedentary group. conclusion mvpa and sedentary behaviour may act independently in their relation with crf, and that mvpa levels may not overcome the deleterious influence of high-sedentary time in maximising crf.
@result elastic network models for rna: a comparative assessment with molecular dynamics and shape experiments elastic network models (enms) are a useful tool for describing large scale motions in protein systems. while they are well validated in the context of proteins, relatively little is known about their applicability to nucleic acids, whose different architecture does not necessarily warrant comparable performance. in this study we thoroughly evaluate and optimize the efficiency of popular enms for capturing rna and dna flexibility. we also introduce two alternative models in which the strength of elastic connections at a coarse-grained level is governed by distance distribution at atomic resolution. for each of the considered enms we report the optimal length of spring connections as well as the scaling of elastic force constants that provides the best agreement of vibrational frequencies with normal modes based on atomic force field. in order to determine the absolute values of force constants we introduce a novel method based on the overlap of pseudoinverse of hessian matrices.

@result preventive effect of aminoguanidine compared to vitamin e and c on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
@result effects of tolvaptan on dyspnoea relief from the everest trials. context decompensated congestive heart failure (chf) is the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in patients older than 65 years.   objective to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous nesiritide, intravenous nitroglycerin, and placebo.   design, setting, and patients randomized, double-blind trial of 489 inpatients with dyspnea at rest from decompensated chf, including 246 who received pulmonary artery catheterization, that was conducted at 55 community and academic hospitals between october 1999 and july 2000.   interventions intravenous nesiritide (n = 204), intravenous nitroglycerin (n = 143), or placebo (n = 142) added to standard medications for 3 hours, followed by nesiritide (n = 278) or nitroglycerin (n = 216) added to standard medication for 24 hours.   main outcome measures change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp) among catheterized patients and patient self-evaluation of dyspnea at 3 hours after initiation of study drug among all patients. secondary outcomes included comparisons of hemodynamic and clinical effects between nesiritide and nitroglycerin at 24 hours.   results at 3 hours, the mean (sd) decrease in pcwp from baseline was -5.8 (6.5) mm hg for nesiritide (vs placebo, p<.001; vs nitroglycerin, p =.03), -3.8 (5.3) mm hg for nitroglycerin (vs placebo, p =.09), and -2 (4.2) mm hg for placebo. at 3 hours, nesiritide resulted in improvement in dyspnea compared with placebo (p =.03), but there was no significant difference in dyspnea or global clinical status with nesiritide compared with nitroglycerin. at 24 hours, the reduction in pcwp was greater in the nesiritide group (-8.2 mm hg) than the nitroglycerin group (-6.3 mm hg), but patients reported no significant differences in dyspnea and only modest improvement in global clinical status.   conclusion when added to standard care in patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated chf, nesiritide improves hemodynamic function and some self-reported symptoms more effectively than intravenous nitroglycerin or placebo.
@background identification of pathologically insignificant prostate cancer is not accurate in unscreened men purpose we assessed the relationship between the number of positive cores obtained at extended biopsy and tumor volume in radical prostatectomy specimens as a tool for predicting the biological significance of prostate cancer from biopsy data.   materials and methods the study group included 207 men who were treated with radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy at our cancer center. all patients were diagnosed by systematic extended biopsy (10 or 11 cores) performed between 1997 and 2003. the variables analyzed were patient age, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy gleason score, maximum tumor length in a core, greatest percent of tumor in a core, total tumor length, total percent of tumor in all cores, positive core location, initial or repeat biopsy and prostate volume in subgroups based on the number of positive cores, that is group 1-1, group 2-2 and group 3-3 or more cores. bivariate correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to determine the predictors of insignificant cancer.   results the number of positive cores was significantly related to total tumor volume (r = 0.433, p <0.001). insignificant prostate cancer (volume less than 0.5 cc and gleason score 6 or less) was found in 21.7% of patients (45 of 207). the incidence of insignificant cancer was 42.5% (31 of 73 patients) in group 1, 16.4% (10 of 61) in group 2 and 5.5% (4 of 73) in group 3. there was a significant difference in the incidence of insignificant cancer among the subgroups (group 1 vs 2 p <0.001, group 1 vs 3 p <0.0001 and group 2 vs 3 p <0.05). the best model for predicting insignificant cancer in group 1 was the combination of tumor length less than 2 mm, gleason score 3 + 4 or less and prostate volume greater than 50 cc with 83.9% sensitivity (26 of 31 patients) and 61.9% specificity (26 of 42).   conclusions the probability of insignificant cancer was directly related to the number of positive cores. tumor length in a core, gleason score and prostate volume significantly enhanced the prediction model for insignificant cancer in men with 1 positive core who underwent extended biopsy.
@method antifolate drug resistance: novel mutations and haplotype distribution in dhps and dhfr from northeast india as chloroquine resistance spreads across africa, the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) inhibitors pyrimethamine and proguanil are being used as alternative first-line drugs for the treatment and prevention of plasmodium falciparum malaria. resistance to these drugs is conferred by point mutations in parasite dhfr. these point mutations can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, but better methods for sample collection, dna extraction, and a diagnostic pcr are needed to make these assays useful in malaria-endemic areas. here we report methods for collecting fingerstick blood onto filter paper strips that are air-dried, then stored and transported at room temperature. cell lysis and dna extraction are accomplished by boiling in chelex-100. we also report a nested pcr technique that has improved sensitivity and specificity. these procedures readily detect mixed infections of parasites with both sensitive and resistant genotypes (confirmed by direct sequencing) and are reliable at parasite densities less than 250/mm3 in field surveys.
@result managing relationship decay using a retrospective method, we assessed late adolescents' developmental theories about their affective relationships with their parents. subjects used drawings and questionnaire ratings to portray their relationships with parents at five points between infancy and the present. from infancy to their current age, adolescents portrayed their relationships in two major ways. they perceived themselves as gaining in responsibility, dominance, independence, and similarity from infancy to the present, whereas they portrayed their parents as experiencing a decline on these dimensions. for variables indicating closeness and love, however, there was a striking discontinuity in these linear trends: although adolescents perceived linear trends from infancy to adolescence, they depicted their current relationships as involving a great deal more love and closeness. they also portrayed their relationships with mothers and fathers somewhat differently. more responsibility was felt towards the mothers and they were portrayed as especially friendly, but subjects felt more similar to their fathers, whom they perceived as dominant. we interpreted the results as indicating that late adolescents constructed theories of the affective components of their relationships with their parents to serve the needs of separation while maintaining a close affective tie to the parents.
@result transgenic expression of soluble human cd5 enhances experimentally-induced autoimmune and anti-tumoral immune responses cd5 is a 67 kda type i glycoprotein which belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (srcr) family of receptors. this family includes either cell-surface (e.g. cd6) or secreted (e.g. spalpha) proteins implicated in the development of the immune system and the regulation of immune responses. in this study, we purified and characterised a circulating natural soluble cd5 form (nscd5) which is indistinguishable (in apparent molecular mass, glycosylation pattern, and antibody reactivity) from a recombinant soluble cd5 form (rscd5) composed of the three extracellular scrc domains. the nscd5 is a n-glycosylated 52 kda molecule present in normal human serum and in supernatants of in vitro phorbol ester- and cd3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the nscd5 concentration in sera from healthy donors is relatively low (median 1.75 ng/ml, rn=166) and is similar to that found in sera from patients suffering of various autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus, primary sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis) and non-autoimmune (chronic renal failure, b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) disorders. in vitro experiments indicate that nscd5 is released by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane form. these results represent the first evidence of proteolytic release of a transmembrane srcr family member following cell activation.
@background induction and inhibition of ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring mutations in hypermutator bacteria the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem‐cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.

@background inflammatory cells, microglia and mhc class ii antigen-positive cells in the spinal cord of lewis rats with acute and chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (cns), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen cd45, many cells were coisolated that were mrc ox42+ (complement receptor 3/cd11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of cd45 and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules. most cells from normal cns, in contrast, lay within this latter, cd45low population. from previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated cd45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating cd45, cd4, and mhc class i molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of mhc class ii molecules. a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed cns provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. in normal cns, a very small population of blood-derived cd45high-expressing cells are present; most mhc class ii expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.

@result substances with estrogenic activity in effluents of sewage treatment plants in southwestern germany. 2. biological analysis. the cdna of rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rter), highly and stably expressed in yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used to analyse the biological activity of the receptor. the rter mrna encoded a 65-kda protein which was immunorevealed by a specific antibody and migrated with the authentic rter major protein form detected in trout liver. yeast rter bound estradiol with high affinity and the dissociation constant (kd = 1.35 nm) was very similar to the value measured from trout liver extracts but 3-5-fold higher than the kd found for human estrogen receptor (her). this indicates therefore that the rter has a lower estradiol affinity compared to the human receptor. while the her kd remained unchanged at both 4 degrees c or 22 degrees c, it was slightly modified at 30 degrees c. the kd measured for rter at 22 degrees c and 30 degrees c were about 2-fold, and 12-fold higher, respectively, than the kd obtained at 4 degrees c suggesting an alteration of the rter affinity for its ligand at elevated temperature. to examine the estrogen-receptor-mediated activation of transcription in yeast, reporter plasmids integrated or not in the yeast genome were used. the reporter genes consist of one, two, or three copies of estrogen-responsive elements (ere) upstream of the yeast proximal cyc1 or ura3 promoters fused to the lacz gene of escherichia coli coding for beta-galactosidase. the induction of beta-galactosidase activity for all reporter genes was strictly dependent on the presence of rter and estrogens. the activation of transcription mediated by rter responded in an estradiol-dose-dependent manner as in animal cells. however, compared to her, the estradiol concentration necessary to achieve maximal activation was 10-fold higher. this is probably a consequence of the lower estradiol-affinity for rter compared to her. the levels of induction of the reporter genes containing two or three ere were strongly enhanced compared to the one ere construct. this is in agreement with the synergistic effect previously described for multiple ere. the magnitudes of transcriptional induction mediated by rter and her were similar when the reporter gene containing three ere was used but changed when the one ere construct was used. in this case transcriptional activation indicated by rter was 10-20 fold lower. this suggests that rter requires protein/protein interaction for its stabilization on dna. antiestrogens were able to bind rter and promote gene transcription. however, to produce effects comparable to those obtained with estrogens, much higher concentrations were required. this may imply nonetheless that antihormones were capable of provoking efficient interactions of rter with the transcriptional machinery.
@background an analysis of the clinical and biologic significance of tp53 loss and the identification of potential novel transcriptional targets of tp53 in multiple myeloma. the ability to derive a whole-genome map of transcription-factor binding sites (tfbs) is crucial for elucidating gene regulatory networks. herein, we describe a robust approach that couples chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) with the paired-end ditag (pet) sequencing strategy for unbiased and precise global localization of tfbs. we have applied this strategy to map p53 targets in the human genome. from a saturated sampling of over half a million pet sequences, we characterized 65,572 unique p53 chip dna fragments and established overlapping pet clusters as a readout to define p53 binding loci with remarkable specificity. based on this information, we refined the consensus p53 binding motif, identified at least 542 binding loci with high confidence, discovered 98 previously unidentified p53 target genes that were implicated in novel aspects of p53 functions, and showed their clinical relevance to p53-dependent tumorigenesis in primary cancer samples.

@method a phase‐variable mechanism controlling the campylobacter jejuni flgr response regulator influences commensalism campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans in developed countries throughout the world. this bacterium frequently promotes a commensal lifestyle in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals including birds and consumption or handling of poultry meats is a prevalent source of c. jejuni for infection in humans. to understand how the bacterium promotes commensalism, we used signature‐tagged transposon mutagenesis and identified 29 mutants representing 22 different genes of c. jejuni strain 81–176 involved in colonization of the chick gastrointestinal tract. among the determinants identified were two adjacent genes, one encoding a methyl‐accepting chemotaxis protein (mcp), presumably required for proper chemotaxis to a specific environmental component, and another gene encoding a putative cytochrome c peroxidase that may function to reduce periplasmic hydrogen peroxide stress during in vivo growth. deletion of either gene resulted in attenuation for growth throughout the gastrointestinal tract. further examination of 10 other putative mcps or mcp‐domain containing proteins of c. jejuni revealed one other required for wild‐type levels of caecal colonization. this study represents one of the first genetic screens focusing on the bacterial requirements necessary for promoting commensalism in a vertebrate host.
@method dynamic asymmetries in disparity convergence eye movements experiments are described in which monocular accommodation response/stimulus curves were measured with snellen targets over the stimulus range from +1.0 to -5.0 d, using artificial pupils with diameters of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 mm and a constant retinal illuminance of 600 td. the results agree with those of earlier authors in showing a diminished response with smaller pupils. the slopes of the quasi-linear central portions of the response/stimulus curves are well described in terms of a geometrical optical approximation in which the accommodation system works to produce a retinal blur circle whose diameter is a linear function of the dioptric difference between the magnitudes of the stimulus and the accommodative resting state, this blur circle diameter being independent of the pupil diameter. further consideration of diffractive effects suggests that contrast changes in the intermediate spatial frequency components (approximately 5 c/deg) of the retinal image may play a dominant role in guiding the response.
@background matrix metalloproteinases expressed by astrocytes mediate extracellular amyloid-β peptide catabolism activated macrophages produce several matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of extracellular matrix (ecm)‐degrading enzymes, during wound healing and in other inflammatory states. in response to brain injury, brain microglia become “activated,” in a way similar to peripheral tissue macrophages, a process which includes differentiation and probably invasion and proliferation. little is known about the ecm‐degrading mmps that are secreted by microglia upon activation. thus, it was of interest to determine whether activated microglia secrete mmps. conditioned media samples obtained from cultured microglia that were stimulated with various activating agents were subjected to gelatin‐substrate zymography. microglia constitutively express low levels of a 94‐kda gelatinase (glase) activity. treatment with lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus for 24 hr stimulated the activity of the 94‐kda glase, 4‐20‐fold, in a dose‐dependent manner. addition of infγ inhibited the lps‐stimulated activity of mmp‐9. lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus also stimulated the secretion of il‐6 from microglia in a dose‐dependent manner. the 94‐kda glase activity was ca++ dependent, it was inhibited by 1,10‐phenanthroline, and it was activated by organomercurial compounds. when immunoblots were performed using specific antisera against the 94‐kda gelatinase b (mmp‐9) with untreated and lps‐stimulated conditioned medium samples, a 94‐kda immunopositive band was observed. thus, it appears that the 94‐kda glase is gelatinase b (mmp‐9). these results indicate that activators of peripheral macrophages are potent secretagogues for the mmps in cultured microglia. the ability of activated microglia to secrete mmps suggests that these enzymes may play an important function in the brain parenchyma during inflammatory states. © 1995 wiley‐liss, inc.
@background geographic variations in retention in care among hiv-infected adults in the united states cohort studies based upon clinic populations and medical records are becoming more abundant due in part to an increasing trend toward electronic medical records and advancement in information technology. this design has been utilized in the hiv setting to great success and involves following individuals as they access medical care. these clinical cohort designs have not been compared to the classic interval cohort design in which individuals are followed at specified intervals that are unrelated to the participants' ongoing health care. the interval and clinical cohort designs are distinguished and the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each design are discussed.
@background exploring the diffeomorphism invariant hilbert space of a scalar field in loop quantum gravity, matter fields can have support only on the 'polymer-like' excitations of quantum geometry, and their algebras of observables and hilbert spaces of states cannot refer to a classical, background geometry. therefore, to adequately handle the matter sector, one has to address two issues already at the kinematic level. first, one has to construct the appropriate background-independent operator algebras and hilbert spaces. second, to make contact with low-energy physics, one has to relate this 'polymer description' of matter fields to the standard fock description in minkowski space. while this task has been completed for gauge fields, important gaps remained in the treatment of scalar fields. the purpose of this letter is to fill these gaps.
@method improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
@background sex differences in the oxygen uptake kinetic response to heavy-intensity exercise in prepubertal children to determine the precise nonsteady-state characteristics of ventilation (ve), o2 uptake (vo2), and co2 output (vco2) during moderate-intensity exercise, six subjects each underwent eight repetitions of 100-w constant-load cycling. the tests were preceded either by rest or unloaded cycling ("0" w). an early component of ve, vo2, and vco2 responses, which was obscured on any single test by the breath-to-breath fluctuations, became apparent when the several repetitions were averaged. these early responses were abrupt when the work was instituted from rest but were much slower and smaller from the 0-w base line and corresponded to the phase of cardiodynamic gas exchange. some 20 s after the onset of the work a further monoexponential increase to steady state occurred in all three variables, the time constants of which did not differ between the two types of test. consequently, the exponential behavior of ve, vo2, and vco2 in response to moderate exercise is best described by a model that incorporates only the second phase of the response.
@result soil c, n, p and its stratification ratio affected by artificial vegetation in subsoil, loess plateau china as the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (soc) and how vegetation change may affect soc distributions with depth. the goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of soc content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of soc; and (3) to estimate global soc storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. we based our analysis on .2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. the analysis focused on mineral soil layers. plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of soc. the per- centage of soc in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. in shrublands, the amount of soc in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. globally, the relative distribution of soc with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of soc. total soc content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. the importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling soc fractions at depth. to control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. the percentage of soc in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, inter- mediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests ( p , 0.05 in all cases). the effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. these data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of soc with depth. global soc storage in the to p3mo fsoil was 2344 pg c, or 56% more than the 1502 pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total soc estimates of 1500-1600 pg made by other researchers). global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 pg c, and the biomes with the most soc at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 pg c) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 pg c). our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control soc distributions with depth in the soil. our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and soc pools for carbon sequestration strategies.
@background personality features, dissociation, self-stigma, hope, and the complex treatment of depressive disorder the purpose of this study was to determine whether cloninger's revised 7-factor model of personality showed incremental validity over his four dimensions of temperament. a sample of 2517 australian twins aged over 50 between 1993 and 1995 returned completed self-reported measures of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence from cloninger's temperament and character inventory. many of these twins had participated in a 1988 study containing cloninger's temperament measures of harm avoidance, novelty seeking, reward dependence and persistence. contrary to theoretical expectations, univariate analyses revealed that familial aggregation for the character dimensions could be entirely explained by additive gene action alone. although temperament explained 26, 37 and 10% of additive genetic variance in self-directedness, cooperativeness and self-transcendence, respectively, seven genetic factors were required to explain the genetic variance among the tpq dimensions, and almost all of the non-shared environmental variance was unique to each dimension of character. our results indicate that the inclusion of all seven dimensions in a taxonomy of personality is warranted.
@method domain-dependent identification of multiword expressions much work on idioms has focused on type identification, i.e., determining whether a sequence of words can form an idiomatic expression. since an idiom type often has a literal interpretation as well, token classification of potential idioms in context is critical for nlp. we explore the use of informative prior knowledge about the overall syntactic behaviour of a potentially-idiomatic expression (type-based knowledge) to determine whether an instance of the expression is used idiomatically or literally (token-based knowledge). we develop unsupervised methods for the task, and show that their performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art supervised techniques.
@background when are the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty large? many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
@background trait anxiety, state anxiety, and attentional bias to threat: assessing the psychometric properties of response time measures testing feasibility and efficacy of psychological treatment via mobile devices is important, given its potential benefits for high-dosage treatment delivery, widespread and inexpensive dissemination, and efficient research methods. we conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. all participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. participants completed weekly internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. the between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. on measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre–post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.
@background effectiveness of role-playing as a pedagogical approach in construction education designing and delivering courses that impart essential learning objectives such as problem solving skills, decision making skills, communication skills, teambuilding, and leadership skills are critical for construction education. considering the complexity of the construction industry, it is of utmost importance to adopt student centered pedagogical strategies for their benefits. one such approach is role-playing teaching that has been successfully implemented in a number of construction programs as well as in various other disciplines. the strategy provides a unique opportunity to the students to assume roles of different project stakeholders and solve real life problems that have been replicated in the classrooms. this paper introduces the concept of role-playing teaching along with the benefits, and also identifies the probable courses in a typical construction program that can be benefitted from the adoption of this pedagogical strategy.
@method process and outcomes from a youth-led campaign to address healthy eating in an urban high school objectives we assessed the statewide impact of the 2004 texas public school nutrition policy on foods and beverages served or sold in schools.   methods we collected lunch food production records from 47 schools in 11 texas school districts for the school years before (2003-2004) and after (2004-2005) policy implementation. cafeteria servings of fruit, vegetables (regular and fried), and milk served each day were calculated. twenty-three schools from 5 districts provided records of à la carte sales of candy, chips, desserts, drinks, ice cream, and water. we examined aggregated school-level differences in total items served or sold per day per student between study years.   results school demographics were similar to state data. regardless of district and school size, cafeterias served significantly fewer high-fat vegetable items per student postpolicy (p < .001). postpolicy snack bar sales of large bags of chips were significantly reduced (p = .006), and baked chips sales significantly increased (p = .048).   conclusions school food policy changes have improved foods served or sold to students. it is not known whether improved lunch choices influence consumption for the whole day.
@method statistical energy potential: reduced representation of dehouck–gilis–rooman function by selecting against decoy datasets we describe predictions made using the rosetta structure prediction methodology for both template‐based modeling and free modeling categories in the seventh critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction. for the first time, aggressive sampling and all‐atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the rosetta@home distributed computing network. template‐based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. free modeling methods gave near‐atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. these results indicate that refinement with an all‐atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions. proteins 2007. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
@result the captive maned wolf (chrysocyon brachyurus): nutritional considerations with emphasis on management of cystinuria this study was designed to characterize the effect of urinary sodium excretion on amino acid excretion in cystinuria. we studied three homozygous patients with cystinuria at various levels of sodium intake ranging between 50 and 230 mmol/day. a reduction in sodium intake produced a marked decrease in rates of urinary cysteine excretion. the low-sodium diet also reduced the excretion of lysine but had no significant effect on the excretion of ornithine or arginine. we conclude that a dietary restriction of sodium may reduce the urinary excretion of cystine and can provide a simple and safe long-term approach to the treatment of cystinuria.
@background effect of polyurethane chemistry and protein coating on monocyte differentiation towards a wound healing phenotype macrophage. a biodegradable lysine diisocyanate-based poly(glycolide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)urethane network has been evaluated as a material for the construction of a macroporous bottom layer (dermal analogue) in a two-layer artificial skin. high rates of in vitro degradation were observed; degradation of the porous poly(glycolide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)urethane networks was faster in vivo than in vitro. subcutaneous implantation in guinea pigs showed that the porous polyurethane networks allowed rapid cell ingrowth, degraded almost completely 4-8 wk after implantation and evoked no adverse tissue reaction.
@background solvation and desolvation effects in protein folding: native flexibility, kinetic cooperativity and enthalpic barriers under isostability conditions. experimental data from global analyses of temperature (t) and denaturant dependence of the folding rates of small proteins led to an intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier hypothesis: to a good approximation, the t-dependence of folding rate under constant native stability conditions is arrhenius. furthermore, for a given protein, the slope of isostability folding rate versus 1/t is essentially independent of native stability. this hypothesis implies a simple relationship between chevron and eyring plots of folding that is easily discernible when both sets of rates are expressed as functions of native stability. using experimental data in the literature, we verify the predicted chevron-eyring relationship for 14 proteins and determine their intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers, which vary approximately from 15 kcal/mol to 40 kcal/mol for different proteins. these enthalpic barriers do not appear to correlate with folding rates, but they exhibit correlation with equilibrium unfolding enthalpy at room temperature. intrinsic enthalpic barriers with similarly high magnitudes apply as well to at least two cases of peptide-peptide and peptide-protein association, suggesting that these barriers are a hallmark of certain general and fundamental kinetic processes during folding and binding. using a class of explicit-chain c(alpha) protein models with constant elementary enthalpic desolvation barriers between c(alpha) positions, we show that small microscopic pairwise desolvation barriers, which are a direct consequence of the particulate nature of water, can act cooperatively to give rise to a significant overall enthalpic barrier to folding. this theoretical finding provides a physical rationalization for the high intrinsic enthalpic barriers in protein folding energetics. ramifications of entropy-enthalpy compensation in hydrophobic association for the height of enthalpic desolvation barrier are discussed.
@method dextrose prolotherapy: a narrative review of basic science, clinical research, and best treatment recommendations. flaws in the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of randomised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated. the cochrane collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more accurate
@background optical characterization of two-layered turbid media for non-invasive, absolute oximetry in cerebral and extracerebral tissue we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
@background diagnostic markers of ovarian cancer by high-throughput antigen cloning and detection on arrays. the her-2/neu protooncogene is amplified and overexpressed in 20-40% of invasive breast cancers. her-2/neu protein overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in several subsets of patients. the protein may also be related to cancer formation, with overexpression being detectable in 50-60% of ductal carcinomas in situ. it has been suggested that it might be possible to develop specific t-cell therapy directed against proteins involved in malignant transformation. one question is whether normal proteins that are overexpressed are appropriate targets for therapeutic immune attack. this report demonstrates that some patients with her-2/neu-positive breast cancers have both existent cd4+ helper/inducer t-cell immunity and antibody-mediated immunity to her-2/neu protein. initial studies performed on 20 premenopausal breast cancer patients identified antibodies to her-2/neu in 11 individuals. similar antibody responses have been found in some normal individuals. the patient with the greatest antibody response was studied in detail. in addition to a humoral immune response this patient had evidence of a significant proliferative t-cell response to the her-2/neu protein and peptides. similar t-cell responses have been detected in additional patients. it has been assumed that patients would be immunologically tolerant to her-2/neu as a self-protein and that immunity might be difficult to generate. if immunity could be generated, the result might be destructive autoimmunity. the current data support the notion that her-2/neu-specific immunity might be used in therapy without destroying normal tissue but also raises questions as to the role of existent immunity in immune surveillance and cancer progression.
@background proteome-wide identification of lysine propionylation in thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria: geobacillus kaustophilus, thermus thermophilus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and rhodothermus marinus recent studies of protein post-translational modifications revealed that various types of lysine acylation occur in eukaryotic and bacterial proteins. lysine propionylation, a newly discovered type of acylation, occurs in several proteins, including some histones. in this study, we identified 361 propionylation sites in 183 mid-exponential phase and late stationary phase proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8, an extremely thermophilic eubacterium. functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. the propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped. furthermore, amino acid frequencies in the vicinity of propionylation sites differed, not only between the two growth phases but also relative to acetylation sites. in addition, 33.8% of mid-exponential phase–specific and 80.0% of late stationary phase–specific propionylations (n ≥ 2) implied that specific mechanisms regulate propionylation in the cell. moreover, the limited degree of overlap between lysine propionylation (36.8%) and acetylation (49.2%) sites in 67 proteins that were both acetylated and propionylated strongly suggested that the two acylation reactions are regulated separately by specific enzymes and may serve different functions. finally, we also found that eight propionylation sites overlapped with acetylation sites critical for protein functions such as schiff-base formation and ligand binding.
@background protein kinase c ( pkc )-a activation inhibits pkc-z and mediates the action of ped / pea-15 on glucose transport in the l 6 skeletal muscle cells we have used differential display to identify genes whose expression is altered in type 2 diabetes thus contributing to its pathogenesis. one mrna is overexpressed in fibroblasts from type 2 diabetics compared with non‐diabetic individuals, as well as in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, two major sites of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. the levels of the protein encoded by this mrna are also elevated in type 2 diabetic tissues; thus, we named it ped for phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes. ped cloning shows that it encodes a 15 kda phosphoprotein identical to the protein kinase c (pkc) substrate pea‐15. the ped gene maps on human chromosome 1q21–22. transfection of ped/pea‐15 in differentiating l6 skeletal muscle cells increases the content of glut1 transporters on the plasma membrane and inhibits insulin‐stimulated glucose transport and cell‐surface recruitment of glut4, the major insulin‐sensitive glucose transporter. these effects of ped overexpression are reversed by blocking pkc activity. overexpression of the ped/pea‐15 gene may contribute to insulin resistance in glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes.
@result when are the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty large? many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
@background match graph construction for large image databases the widespread availability of digital cameras and ubiquitous internet access have facilitated the creation of massive image collections. these collections can be highly interconnected through implicit links between image pairs viewing the same or similar objects. we propose building graphs called image webs to represent such connections. while earlier efforts studied local neighborhoods of such graphs, we are interested in understanding global structure and exploiting connectivity at larger scales. we show how to efficiently construct image webs that capture the connectivity in an image collection using spectral graph theory. our technique can link together tens of thousands of images in a few minutes using a computer cluster. we also demonstrate applications for exploring collections based on global topological analysis.
@background development of a step counter based on artificial neural networks global navigation satellite systems (gnss)-based navigation with smartphones is very popular. but in areas where no gnss signal is found navigation could be useful. examples are navigation in shopping malls, in big offices, in train stations or museums. the goal is to estimate the position in gnss shaded areas to make navigation possible. the mems sensors (micro electro mechanical system) installed in current smartphones, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic field sensor and barometer allow now navigation also in gnss shadowed areas. due to the low quality of these sensors, however, support of the position estimate is needed. in this work, a concept is presented for the construction of an indoor navigation system based on low-cost sensors of smartphones. the position estimate from the available sensor data forms the basis of the position determination. so position estimation is always possible independent of location. first results with kalman filter and particle filter are shown. the presented concept serves as a basis for the construction of a smartphone-based navigation solution for indoor use. therefore the available mems sensors should be used as a position estimator and a wide variety of supporting information can be processed. a first approach for implementation on a smartphone is shown as an example.
@background wing phosphorylation is a major functional determinant of the lrs14‐type biofilm and motility regulator abfr1 in sulfolobus acidocaldarius in this study, the in vitro and in vivo functions of the only two identified protein phosphatases, saci-ptp and saci-pp2a, in the crenarchaeal model organism sulfolobus acidocaldarius were investigated. biochemical characterization revealed that saci-ptp is a dual-specific phosphatase (against pser/pthr and ptyr), whereas saci-pp2a exhibited specific pser/pthr activity and inhibition by okadaic acid. deletion of saci_pp2a resulted in pronounced alterations in growth, cell shape and cell size, which could be partially complemented. transcriptome analysis of the three strains (δsaci_ptp, δsaci_pp2a and the mw001 parental strain) revealed 155 genes that were differentially expressed in the deletion mutants, and showed significant changes in expression of genes encoding the archaella (archaeal motility structure), components of the respiratory chain and transcriptional regulators. phosphoproteome studies revealed 801 unique phosphoproteins in total, with an increase in identified phosphopeptides in the deletion mutants. proteins from most functional categories were affected by phosphorylation, including components of the motility system, the respiratory chain, and regulatory proteins. in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant the up-regulation at the transcript level, as well as the observed phosphorylation pattern, resembled starvation stress responses. hypermotility was also observed in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant. the results highlight the importance of protein phosphorylation in regulating essential cellular processes in the crenarchaeon s. acidocaldarius.
@background protein polymorphism is negatively correlated with conservation of intronic sequences and complexity of expression patterns in drosophila melanogaster synonymous codons are not used equally in many organisms, and the extent of codon bias varies among loci. earlier studies have suggested that more highly expressed loci in drosophila melanogaster are more biased, consistent with findings from several prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes that codon bias is partly due to natural selection for translational efficiency. we link this model of varying selection intensity to the population-genetics prediction that the effectiveness of natural selection is decreased under reduced recombination. in analyses of 385 d. melanogaster loci, we find that codon bias is reduced in regions of low recombination (i.e., near centromeres and telomeres and on the fourth chromosome). the effect does not appear to be a linear function of recombination rate; rather, it seems limited to regions with the very lowest levels of recombination. the large majority of the genome apparently experiences recombination at a sufficiently high rate for effective natural selection against suboptimal codons. these findings support models of the hill-robertson effect and genetic hitchhiking and are largely consistent with multiple reports of low levels of dna sequence variation in regions of low recombination.
@background plant stem cell niches. four classes of floral homeotic mads domain proteins specify the identities of the four organ types in an arabidopsis flower. while the activities of the mads domain proteins are essentially confined to the flower or to the inflorescence, several genes, such as apetala2, hua1 and hua2, also act outside the flower in addition to their organ identity functions inside the flower. we identified a new gene, hua enhancer 1 (hen1) from a sensitized genetic screen in the hua1-1 hua2-1 background that is compromised in floral homeotic c function. we showed that hen1, like the c function gene agamous, acts to specify reproductive organ identities and to repress a function. hen1 also shares ag's non-homeotic function in controlling floral determinacy. hen1 may achieve these functions by regulating the expression of ag. hen1 single mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes such as reduced organ size, altered rosette leaf shape and increased number of coflorescences, during most stages of development. therefore, hen1, like the a function gene ap2, plays multiple roles in plant development as well as acting in organ identity specification in the flower. hen1 codes for a novel protein and is expressed throughout the plant.

@background effects of electrical stimulation on meat quality of lamb and goat meat our study examined high and low voltage electrical stimulation and postmortem storage as strategies to improve tenderness and lean color in cabrito carcasses. boer cross (n=60) kids were assigned to either high (550 v), low (20 v), or no electrical stimulation treatments. no differences in muscle temperature were observed between treatments at any time measured. muscle ph declined fastest in high voltage treated carcasses. high voltage electrical stimulation slightly increased (p<0.05) b (∗) and a (∗) in the m. gluteus medius and tended to increase l (∗) and b (∗) (p=0.06 and 0.11, respectively) values in the m. longissimus thoracis. electrical stimulation had no effect on myofibril fragmentation at 1-, 3-, or 14-d postmortem or sarcomere length. high voltage electrical stimulation increased (p<0.05) tenderness at 1- and 3-d postmortem, but not at 14-d postmortem. aging for 3 d did not affect tenderness regardless of stimulation treatment, but aging time for 14 d improved (p<0.05) tenderness. these data indicate that high voltage electrical stimulation and 14 d aging were effective in improving the tenderness of meat from cabrito carcasses.
@result performance and immune responses to dietary beta-glucan in broiler chicks. β-glucan, one of the major cell wall components of saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been found to enhance immune functions. this study investigated in vivo and in vitro effects of β-glucan on lymphoproliferation and interferonγ (ifn-γ) production by splenic cells from c57bl/6 female mice. all experiments were performed with particulate βglucan derived from s. cerevisiae. data demonstrated that both, i.p administration of particulate β-glucan (20 or 100 μg/animal) and in vitro stimulation of splenic cells (20 or 100 μg/ml of culture) decreased lymphoproliferation and ifn-γ production induced by concanavalin a. these results suggest that β-glucan can trigger a down-modulatory effect regulating a deleterious immune system hyperactivity in the presence of a strong stimulus.
@method visual analytics for evaluating clinical pathways under the umbrella of buzzwords such as “business activity monitoring” (bam) and “business process intelligence” (bpi) both academic (e.g., emit, little thumb, inwolve, process miner, and minson) and commercial tools (e.g., aris ppm, hp bpi, and ilog jviews) have been developed. the goal of these tools is to extract knowledge from event logs (e.g., transaction logs in an erp system or audit trails in a wfm system), i.e., to do process mining. unfortunately, tools use different formats for reading/storing log files and present their results in different ways. this makes it difficult to use different tools on the same data set and to compare the mining results. furthermore, some of these tools implement concepts that can be very useful in the other tools but it is often difficult to combine tools. as a result, researchers working on new process mining techniques are forced to build a mining infrastructure from scratch or test their techniques in an isolated way, disconnected from any practical applications. to overcome these kind of problems, we have developed the prom framework, i.e., an “pluggable” environment for process mining. the framework is flexible with respect to the input and output format, and is also open enough to allow for the easy reuse of code during the implementation of new process mining ideas. this paper introduces the prom framework and gives an overview of the plug-ins that have been developed.
@background percutaneous lung biopsy after pneumonectomy: factors for improving success in the care of patients at high risk. 2division of abdominal imaging and interventional radiology, massachusetts general hospital, boston, ma. case history a 75-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial infarction. the patient was a former heavy smoker. a chest radiograph revealed a left apical lung mass (fig. 1). a ct scan showed a cavitary left upper lobe lung mass measuring 3.5 × 4 cm (fig. 2a) with an additional 3 × 2 cm mass at the left hilum (fig. 2b). a wholebody pet scan showed the left upper lobe mass and at the left hilum, increased 18f-fdg uptake that was suggestive of lung neoplasm metastatic to the left hilum (fig. 3). therefore, a thoracic radiologist was consulted for biopsy of the left upper lobe lung mass. dr. titton. it is interesting to note that a pet scan was obtained for this patient. what is the role of 18f-fdg pet in the evaluation of patients with a pulmonary nodule or lung cancer? dr. kalra. in the evaluation of patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule, 18f-fdg pet improves characterization of the nodule by estimating the probability of malignancy. the high positive predictive value for malignancy in nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter suggests that those with positive scan results should undergo either percutaneous biopsy or surgical resection. histologic examination of pet-positive lesions is necessary because false-positive pet findings can be encountered with granulomatous lesions secondary to sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or infection [1]. false-negative pet findings are seen in patients with small lesions (< 1 cm) and in selected malignancies, such as bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma or carcinoid tumor. for this reason, regardless of pet findings,
@method relative influence of meteorological conditions and aerosols on the lifetime of mesoscale convective systems we estimate the extent of upper tropospheric aerosol layers (ut als) surrounding mesoscale convective systems (mcss) and explore the relationships between ut al extent and the morphology, location, and developmental stage of collocated mcss in the tropics. our analysis is based on satellite data collected over equatorial africa, south asia, and the amazon basin between june 2006 and june 2008. we identify substantial variations in the relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport by region and stage of convective development. the most extensive ut als over equatorial africa are associated with mature mcss, while the most extensive ut als over south asia and the amazon are associated with growing mcss. convective aerosol transport over the amazon is weaker than that observed over the other two regions despite similar transport frequencies, likely due to the smaller sizes and shorter mean lifetimes of mcss over the amazon. variations in ut als in the vicinity of tropical mcss are primarily explained by variations in the horizontal sizes of the associated mcss and are largely unrelated to aerosol loading in the lower troposphere. we also identify potentially important relationships with the number of convective cores, vertical wind shear, and convective fraction during the growing and mature stages of mcs development. relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport are relatively weak during the decaying stage of convective development. our results provide an interpretive framework for devising and evaluating numerical model experiments that examine relationships between convective properties and als in the upper troposphere.
@result low-frequency atmospheric acoustic energy associated with vortices produced by thunderstorms abstract this paper attempts to explain the “whining” or “hissing” sound reported from tornadoes. the leading hypothesis is that the air masses involved in the tornado circulation execute some free vibrations. it is found that these vibrations may be in the audible range for a small vortex whose radius is of the order of 10 m. or less. a formula is obtained which relates the frequency of the tone to the inner radius of the vortex. this formula is amenable to experimental verification.
@background the power of rejection in online bottleneck matching given a set s ⊆ r of points on the line, we consider the task of matching a sequence (r1, r1,... ) of requests in r to points in s. it has been conjectured [online algorithms: the state of the art, lecture notes in computer science, vol. 1442, springer, berlin, 1998, pp. 268-280] that there exists a 9-competitive online algorithm for this problem, similar to the so-called "cow path" problem [inform. and comput. 106 (1993) 234-252]. we disprove this conjecture and show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio strictly less than 9.001.our argument is based on a new proof for the optimality of the competitive ratio 9 for the "cow path" problem.
@background enhanced expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases in aniline-induced cell proliferation in rat spleen. cell cycle progression and cell division are driven by the sequential activation of a group of serine-threonine kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). multiple cdks control the cell cycle in mammals and have been long considered essential for normal proliferation, development and homeostasis. the importance of the cdk-cyclin complexes in cell proliferation is underscored by the fact that deregulation of the cdk activity is found in virtually the whole spectrum of human tumors. advances in the cell cycle proteins in the last 25 years, since the discovery of cyclins, have been discussed and have shed even more light on this essential life sustaining process. recent information from different models for the various cyclins and cdks have made some of the generally accepted concepts of cell cycle regulation to be revised and new and exciting questions to be investigated. there is also increasing evidence that suggests that cdks such as cdc2 are also commonly targeted by viral proteins, which modulate host cell cycle machinery to benefit viral survival or replication. this review, describes some of the most recent and important us patents related to cell cycle regulation and those on viral proteins involved in cell cycle modulation particularly the g2/m phase transition and cancer therapy.
@method impacts from control operations on a recreationally hunted feral swine population at a large military installation in florida summaryin the last decades, wild boar (sus scrofa) distribution has increased world-wide, the iberian peninsula being no exception. the wild boar now inhabits almost the entire iberian territory, where today it is one of the most important big game species. in this paper, for the first time, bag analysis from two ecological different regions are presented and compared to the employed hunting techniques. one represents the well-preserved mediterranean forests of south-western spain, the other, located in the south of portugal, is a farmland with interspersed forest areas. our results indicate a stronger hunting intensity and also a higher wild boar population density in the portuguese study areas. the stronger hunting intensity may result in a younger wild boar population. we also found considerable differences between the shooting techniques used in both regions and those employed in the north-east of the peninsula. it does therefore not seem advisable to directly compare bag statistics from different regions of the iberian peninsula.zusammenfassungin den letzten jahrzehnten hat das wildschwein (sus scrofa) sein vebreitungsgebiet weltweit ausgedehnt. die iberische halbinsel bildet diesbezüglich keine ausnahme. das wildschwein kommt dort gegenwärtig nahezu überall vor und stellt eine der wichtigsten gro\wildarten dar. in dieser arbeit werden erstmals streckenanalysen aus zwei ökologisch unterschiedlichen regionen der iberischen halbinsel vorgelegt und im hinblick auf die eingesetzten jagdmethoden verglichen. eine region repräsentiert die gut erhaltenen mediterranen wälder südwest-spaniens. die andere, im süden portugals gelegene untersuchungsregion ist ein agrargebiet mit eingestreuten wäldern. unsere ergebnisse weisen auf einen höheren jagddruck sowie eine grö\ere populationsdichte der wildschweine im portugiesischen untersuchungsgebiet hin. der grö\ere jagddruck kann ursache für ein im mittel geringeres alter der dortigen wildschwein-population sein. es wurden ferner beachtliche unterschiede in den bejagungsmethoden zwischen den beiden untersuchungsgebieten und dem nordosten iberiens beobachtet. wegen dieser unterschiede erscheint ein direkter vergleich von streckenergebnissen aus verschiedenen regionen der iberischen halbinsel nicht ratsam.résuméau cours des dernières décennies, la distribution mondiale du sanglier (sus scrofa) a fortement augmenté, la péninsule ibérique ne faisant pas exception à cet égard. le sanglier colonise pratiquement l'entièreté du territoire ibérique où il représente aujourd'hui une des espèces-gibier les plus importantes. dans cette contribution, pour la première fois, l'analyse des tableaux de tir réalisés dans deux régions écologiquement différentes est présentée et rapportée aux techniques cynégétiques utilisées. l'une correspond aux forêts méditerranéennes bien conservées du sud-ouest de l'espagne, l'autre, située au sud du portugal, est constituée d'une alternance de terres agricoles et de forêts. nos résultats indiquent une pression cynégétique plus intense de même qu'une densité de population en sangliers plus élevée dans la partie portugaise de l'aire d'étude. la pression cynégétique plus forte peut donner lieu à une population de sangliers plus jeune. nous avons également constaté des différences considérables entre les techniques de tir utilisées dans les deux régions et celles utilisées dans le nord-est de la péninsule. il ne semble dès lors pas recommandable de comparer directement les statistiques de tir de différentes régions de la péninsule ibérique.
@background conservative management of cecal diverticulitis mimicking acute appendicitis in a pregnant woman diverticula are herniations through the colonic wall and are therefore likely to be due to a weakness within the wall, an alteration in intracolonic pressures or a combination of these factors. this article reviews these aspects in relation to the pathogenesis of colonic diverticula.
@background species richness and cover along a 60-year chronosequence in old-fields of southeastern spain plant species diversity patterns of the rocky mountain forests were found to be at variance with patterns reported from other regions. the most centrally located forests in terms of elevation, site moisture and successional status were found to have the lowest diversity. in contrast, the peripheral and environmentally more severe sites were found to have relatively high diversity. in particular, the forest-grassland transition and the low elevation riparian forests have species diversity values as high as any yet reported from western north america. when diversity was examined in terms of variation across elevation or moisture gradients, varying results were obtained due to the interaction of these factors. the failure of previous studies to converge on generalizations about plant diversity reflects, in part, the failure of most investigators to view diversity in a regional context of variation across several interacting gradients. diversity was seen to vary inversely with the degree of development of the forest canopy. the interaction of different components of the forest community is one reason for the failure of general patterns of plant species diversity to emerge from previous studies. a potentially rich herb community can be greatly suppressed by a single species tree stratum. among the most successful work to date on species diversity is that on birds, a distinct albeit large and functional group. it is unlikely that similar success could have been achieved through work on all animal species simultaneously. this suggests the need to examine plant species diversity, not in terms of total diversity, but in terms of component functional groups, perhaps guilds, growing under similar microclimatic conditions and subject to similar competitive pressures.
@background pollination, wounding and jasmonate treatments induce the expression of a developmentally regulated pistil dioxygenase at a distance, in the ovary, in the wild potato solanum chacoense bitt. a heterologous cdna probe from petunia hybrida was used to isolate flavanone-3 beta-hydroxylase-encoding cdna clones from carnation (dianthus caryophyllus), china aster (callistephus chinensis) and stock (matthiola incana). the deduced protein sequences together with the known sequences of the enzyme from p. hybrida, barley (hordeum vulgare) and snapdragon (antirrhinum majus) enabled the determination of a consensus sequence which revealed an overall 84% similarity (53% identity) of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases from the different sources. alignment with the sequences of other known enzymes of the same class and to related non-heme iron-(ii) enzymes demonstrated the strict genetic conservation of 14 amino acids, in particular, of three histidines and an aspartic acid. the conservation of the histidine motifs provides strong support for the possible conservation of structurally similar iron-binding sites in these enzymes. the putative role of histidines as chelators of ferrous ions in the active site of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases was corroborated by diethyl-pyrocarbonate modification of the partially purified recombinant petunia enzyme.
@background obstruction degree: measuring concurrency in shared memory systems we propose obstruction-free step complexity, a new complexity measure for nonblocking algorithms. we believe that this measure provides a more pragmatic quanti.cation of nonblocking algorithms than previous measures, providing better guidance for designers of practical nonblocking algorithms.    in our opinion, the main shortcoming of existing complexity measures for nonblocking algorithms is that they are targeted towardsworst-case behavior inworstcase scenarios, and say little about behavior inmore common cases.this is true for the sensitivity measure of attiya and dagan [1], and the d-local step complexity of afek et al. [2]. these measures are directed at evaluating the behavior of algorithms under contention, i.e., when concurrent operations actively interfere with each other’s progress. however, in practice, a well-designed system manages contention so that it does not impact performance too greatly. thus, these previous measures do not evaluate the behaviour that is likely to be observed.
@method statistical modelling of gaze behaviour as categorical time series: what you should watch to save soccer penalties it is still not known what underlies successful performance in goaltending. some studies have reported that advanced cues from the shooter's body (hip, kicking leg or support leg) are most important (savelsbergh, g. j. p., williams, a. m., van der kamp, j., & ward, p. (2002). visual search, anticipation and expertise in soccer goalkeepers. journal of sports sciences, 20, 279-287; savelsbergh, g. j. p., williams, a. m., van der kamp, j., & ward, p.

(1993). advanced cue utilization in soccer. in t. reilly, j. clarys, & a. stibbe (eds.), science and football ii (pp. 239-243). london, england: e&fn spon), while others have found that the early tracking of the object prior to and during flight is most critical (bard, c., & fleury, m. (1981). considering eye movement as a predictor of attainment. in: i. m. cockerill, & w. m. macgillvary (eds.), vision and sport (pp. 28-41). cheltenham, england: stanley thornes (publishers) ltd.). these results are similar to those found in a number of interceptive timing studies (land, m. f., & mcleod, p. (2000). from eye movements to actions: how batsmen hit the ball. nature neuroscience, 3, 1340-1345; ripoll and fleurance, 1988; vickers, j. n., & adolphe, r. m. (1997). gaze behaviour during a ball tracking and aiming skill. international journal of sports vision, 4, 18-27). the coupled gaze and motor behavior of elite goaltenders were determined while responding to wrist shots taken from 5 m and 10 m on ice. the results showed that the goalies faced shots that were significantly different in phase durations due to distance (5 versus 10 m), but this was not a factor in making saves. instead, the ability to stop the puck was dependent on the location, onset and duration of the final fixation/tracking gaze (or quiet eye) prior to initiating the saving action. the relative onset of quiet eye was significantly (p<.001) earlier (8.6%) and the duration was longer on saves (m=80.5%; 952.3 ms) compared to goals (onset 18.86%; m=70.1%, 826.1 ms). the quiet eye was located on the puck/stick during the preparation and execution of the shot in 70.53% of all trials, or on the ice in front of the release point of the puck (25.68%) and rarely on the body of the shooter (2.1%). the results are discussed within the context of current research on goaltending with specific emphasis on the timing of critical cues and the effect of tasks constraints.
@background the role of gabab(1) receptor isoforms in anxiety and depression: genetic and pharmacological studies in the mouse b-type receptors for the neurotransmitter gaba (γ-aminobutyric acid) inhibit neuronal activity through g-protein-coupled second-messenger systems, which regulate the release of neurotransmitters and the activity of ion channels and adenylyl cyclase. physiological and biochemical studies show that there are differences in drug efficiencies at different gabab receptors, so it is expected that gabab-receptor (gababr) subtypes exist. two gabab-receptor splice variants have been cloned (gababr1a and gababr1b), but native gabab receptors and recombinant receptors showed unexplained differences in agonist-binding potencies. moreover, the activation of presumed effector ion channels in heterologous cells expressing the recombinant receptors proved difficult,. here we describe a new gabab receptor subtype, gababr2, which does not bind available gabab antagonists with measurable potency. gababr1a, gababr1b and gababr2 alone do not activate kir3-type potassium channels efficiently, but co-expression of these receptors yields a robust coupling to activation of kir3 channels. we provide evidence for the assembly of heteromeric gabab receptors in vivo and show that gababr2 and gababr1a/b proteins immunoprecipitate and localize together at dendritic spines. the heteromeric receptor complexes exhibit a significant increase in agonist- and partial-agonist-binding potencies as compared with individual receptors and probably represent the predominant native gabab receptor. heteromeric assembly among g-protein-coupled receptors has not, to our knowledge, been described before.
@method peak exercise oxygen uptake and left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and arterial mechanics in healthy young men objectives the study was done to evaluate reliability of echocardiographic left ventricular (lv) mass.   background echocardiographic estimation of lv mass is affected by several sources of variability.   methods we assessed intrapatient reliability of lv mass measurements in 183 hypertensive patients (68% men, 65 +/- 9 years) enrolled in the prospective randomized enalapril study evaluating regression of ventricular enlargement (preserve) trial after a screening echocardiogram (echo) showed lv hypertrophy. a second echo was repeated at randomization (45 +/- 25 days later). two-dimensional (2d)-guided m-mode or 2d linear measurements of lv cavity and wall dimensions were verified by one experienced reader.   results mean lv mass was similar at first and second echo (243 +/- 53 vs. 241 +/- 54 g) and showed high reliability as estimated by intraclass correlation coefficient (rho) = 0.93. within-patient 5th, 10th, 90th and 95th percentiles of between-study difference in lv mass were -32 g, -28 g, +25 g and +35 g. mean lv mass fell less from the first to the second echo than expected from a formula to predict regression to the mean (2 +/- 19 vs. 17 +/- 12 g, p < 0.001). reliability was also high for lv internal diameter (rho = 0.87), septal (rho = 0.85) and posterior wall thickness (rho = 0.83). substantial or moderate reliability was observed for measures of lv systolic function and diastolic filling (rho from 0.71 to 0.57).   conclusions left ventricular mass had high reliability and little regression to the mean; between-study lv mass change of +/-35 g or +/-17 g had > or = 95% or > or = 80% likelihood of being true change.
@background biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise of the membrane potential by sodium channel inactivation or subthreshold axonal potassium current a slowly inactivating, low-threshold k(+) current has been implicated in the regulation of state transitions and repetitive activity in striatal medium spiny neurons. however, the molecular identity of the channels underlying this current and their biophysical properties remain to be clearly determined. because previous work had suggested this current arose from kv1 family channels, high-affinity toxins for this family were tested for their ability to block whole cell k(+) currents activated by depolarization of acutely isolated neurons. alpha-dendrotoxin, which blocks channels containing kv1.1, kv1.2, or kv1.6 subunits, decreased currents evoked by depolarization. three other kv1 family toxins that lack a high affinity for kv1.2 subunits, r-agitoxin-2, dendrotoxin-k, and r-margatoxin, failed to significantly reduce currents, implicating channels with kv1.2 subunits. rt-pcr results confirmed the expression of kv1.2 mrna in identified medium spiny neurons. currents attributable to kv1.2 channels activated rapidly, inactivated slowly, and recovered from inactivation slowly. in the subthreshold range (ca. -60 mv), these currents accounted for as much as 50% of the depolarization-activated k(+) current. moreover, their rapid activation and relatively slow deactivation suggested that they contribute to spike afterpotentials regulating repetitive discharge. this inference was confirmed in current-clamp recordings from medium spiny neurons in the slice preparation where kv1.2 blockade reduced first-spike latency and increased discharge frequency evoked from hyperpolarized membrane potentials resembling the "down-state" found in vivo. these studies establish a clear functional role for somato-dendritic kv1.2 channels in the regulation of state transitions and repetitive discharge in striatal medium spiny neurons.
@background parietotemporal stimulation affects acquisition of novel grapheme-phoneme mappings in adult readers 1 in this paper we demonstrate in the intact human the possibility of a non‐invasive modulation of motor cortex excitability by the application of weak direct current through the scalp. 2 excitability changes of up to 40 %, revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation, were accomplished and lasted for several minutes after the end of current stimulation. 3 excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. 4 by varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after‐effects could be controlled. 5 the effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. functional alterations related to post‐tetanic potentiation, short‐term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation. transcranial electrical stimulation using weak current may thus be a promising tool to modulate cerebral excitability in a non‐invasive, painless, reversible, selective and focal way.
@background genetic variability of respiratory syncytial virus a in hospitalized children in the last five consecutive winter seasons in central spain human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout life. we investigated the genetic variability of rsv-a circulating in ontario during 2010–2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the g glycoprotein gene. among the 201 consecutive rsv isolates studied, rsv-a (55.7%) was more commonly observed than rsv-b (42.3%). 59.8% and 90.1% of rsv-a infections were among children ≤12 months and ≤5 years old, respectively. on phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 rsv-a strains, 110 (98.2%) clustered within or adjacent to the na1 genotype; two isolates were ga5 genotype. eleven (10%) na1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel rsv-a genotype, named on1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the c-terminal region of the attachment (g) glycoprotein. the predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. using rna secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. the 23 amino acid on1 g gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential o-glycosylation sites including three o-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among ontario na1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype rsv-a2 strain. the tendency of codon regression in the g-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel rsv-a genotype with a72 nucleotide g gene duplication.
@result an inducible surface presentation system improves cellular immunity against human papillomavirus type 16 e7 antigen in mice after nasal administration with recombinant lactococci. abstract interleukin-12 (il-12), a heterodimeric cytokine, plays an important role in cellular immunity to several bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and has adjuvant activity when it is codelivered with dna vaccines. il-12 has also been used with success in cancer immunotherapy treatments. however, systemic il-12 therapy has been limited by high levels of toxicity. we describe here inducible expression and secretion of il-12 in the food-grade lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis. il-12 was expressed as two separate polypeptides (p35-p40) or as a single recombinant polypeptide (scil-12). the biological activity of il-12 produced by the recombinant l. lactis strain was confirmed in vitro by its ability to induce gamma interferon (ifn-γ) production by mouse splenocytes. local administration of il-12-producing strains at the intranasal mucosal surface resulted in ifn-γ production in mice. the activity was greater with the single polypeptide scil-12. an antigen-specific cellular response (i.e., secretion of th1 cytokines, il-2, and ifn-γ) elicited by a recombinant l. lactis strain displaying a cell wall-anchored human papillomavirus type 16 e7 antigen was dramatically increased by coadministration with an l. lactis strain secreting il-12 protein. our data show that il-12 is produced and secreted in an active form by l. lactis and that the strategy which we describe can be used to enhance an antigen-specific immune response and to stimulate local mucosal immunity.
@background a theory about why we forget what we once knew i know of no one who seriously maintains that interference among tasks is of no consequence in the production of forgetting. whether forgetting is conceptualized at a strict psychological level or at a neural level (e.g., neural memory trace), some provision is made for interference to account for at least some of the measured forgetting. the many studies on retroactive inhibition are probably responsible for this general agreement that interference among tasks must produce a sizable proportion of forgetting. by introducing an interpolated interfering task very marked decrements in recall can be produced in a few minutes in the laboratory. but there is a second generalization which has resulted from these studies, namely, that most forgetting must be a function of the learning of tasks which interfere with that which has already been learned (19). thus, if a single task is learned in the laboratory and retention measured after a week, the loss has been attributed to the interference from activities learned outside the laboratory during the week. it is this generalization with which i am concerned in the initial portions of this paper. now, i cannot deny the data which show large amounts of forgetting produced by an interpolated list in a few minutes in the laboratory. nor do i deny that this loss may be attributed to interference. but i will try to show 1 address of the president, midwestern psychological association, st. louis, missouri,
@background two domains of p 80 katanin regulate microtubule severing and spindle pole targeting by p 60 katanin microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis. the previous discovery of a cyclin b/cdc2-activated microtubule-severing activity in m-phase xenopus egg extracts suggested that a microtubule-severing protein might play an important role in cell cycle-dependent changes in microtubule dynamics and organization. however, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, ef1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin b/cdc2. here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of m-phase severing activity in xenopus eggs. this result suggests that katanin is responsible for changes in microtubules occurring at mitosis. immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that katanin is concentrated at a microtubule-dependent structure at mitotic spindle poles in xenopus a6 cells and in human fibroblasts, suggesting a specific role in microtubule disassembly at spindle poles. surprisingly, katanin was also found in adult mouse brain, indicating that katanin may have other functions distinct from its mitotic role.
@background risk of tuberculosis in dialysis patients: a nationwide cohort study patients with chronic renal failure maintained on intermittent hemodialysis have frequent infections and a suboptimal response to vaccinations. dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting cells essential for the initiation and maintenance of innate and adaptive immunity. in this study we used uremic sera from hemodialysis patients to measure its impact on monocyte and monocyte-derived dendritic cell function in vitro. monocytes from healthy and uremic subjects were isolated using immunomagnetic beads and differentiated into dendritic cells in the presence of either complete sera or sera from hemodialysis patients. dendritic cells from normal patients cultured in uremic sera had decreased endocytosis and impaired maturation. these cells, however, had enhanced il-12p70 production and increased allogeneic t-cell proliferation compared to cells of normal subjects cultured in normal sera. monocyte derived dendritic cells of hemodialysis patients cultured in either normal or uremic sera were functionally impaired for endocytosis and maturation but had enhanced il-12p70 production and allogeneic t-cell proliferation only when cultured with uremic sera. high concentrations of urea in normal sera inhibited all aspects of normal dendritic cell function in vitro. our study suggests that hemodialysis regimes tailored to remove uremic toxins more efficiently may improve immune functions of these patients.
@result hyperbinary expansions and stern polynomials we define a q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and the calkin-wilf sequence. we show that the nth term f(n;q) of the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence is the generating function for the number of hyperbinary expansions of n according to the number of powers that are used exactly twice. we also present formulae for branches within the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and predecessors and successors of terms in the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence.
@result identification of synthetic lethality of prkdc in myc-dependent human cancers by pooled shrna screening dna repair mechanisms are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity. disruption of gene products responsible for dna repair can result in chromosomal damage. improperly repaired chromosomal damage can result in the loss of chromosomes or the generation of chromosomal deletions or translocations, which can lead to tumorigenesis. the myc protooncogene is a transcription factor whose overexpression is frequently associated with human neoplasia. myc has not been previously implicated in a role in dna repair. here we report that the overexpression of myc disrupts the repair of double-strand dna breaks, resulting in a several-magnitude increase in chromosomal breaks and translocations. we found that myc inhibited the repair of γ irradiation dna breaks in normal human cells and blocked the repair of a single double-strand break engineered to occur in an immortal cell line. by spectral karyotypic analysis, we found that myc even within one cell division cycle resulted in a several-magnitude increase in the frequency of chromosomal breaks and translocations in normal human cells. hence, myc overexpression may be a previously undescribed example of a dominant mutator that may fuel tumorigenesis by inducing chromosomal damage.
@background molecular characterization of the porcine group a rotavirus nsp2 and nsp5/6 genes from são paulo state, brazil, in 2011/12 rotaviruses are generally species-specific, but cross-species transmission is possible, as has been demonstrated experimentally. several case studies have indicated infection of humans by animal rotaviruses. comparison of genetic sequences of human and animal rotaviruses often reveals close identity. surveillance of circulating rotaviruses in the human population has revealed the presence of several uncommon genotypes. many of these have been found in domestic animals, and it is possible that they arose in the human population through zoonotic transmission. the low incidence of uncommon strains would suggest that such transmission, or at least the establishment of an animal rotavirus or a human/animal reassortant virus in the human population, does not happen with any great frequency. however, many millions of people will be exposed year on year to animal rotaviruses. this happens within farming communities, and potentially to visitors to the countryside. there may be some measure of environmental contamination through livestock excrement. this exposure may not result in high levels of infection, but some infection could occur. there may be a continual input of rotavirus strains or sequences into the human population from the animal population albeit at a very low level.
@background profiling non-tuberculous mycobacteria in an asian setting: characteristics and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients in singapore diseases and therapies that reduce cell-mediated immunity increase the risk of nontuberculous mycobacterial (ntm) disease. extrapulmonary ntm disease, including disseminated, skin, and catheter-related disease, is more common in immunosuppressed than immunocompetent patients. mycobacterium avium complex remains the most common cause of ntm infection, but rapid growers including mycobacterium abscessus, mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium fortuitum play an important role in skin and catheter-related infections. with the exception of antibiotic prophylaxis for aids patients, the prevention of ntm remains difficult. management is complicated, involving restoration of immune function and removal of catheters in addition to treatment with species-specific antibiotics per current guidelines.
@background organic acid profile of isovaleric acidemia: a comprehensive metabolomics approach isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
@method physics of the nucleon sea quark distributions r � the quark and gluon distributions of the photon are determined in leading and higher order by imposing a vector-meson dominance (vmd) valencelike structure at a low resolution scale adopted from the pion. this leaves only one free parameter, not sufficiently constrained by vmd, to be fixed by experiment. our predictions are in agreement with presently available data for {ital f}{sub 2}{sup {gamma}}({ital x},{ital q}{sup 2}). simple parametri- zations of the resulting parton distributions are presented in the range 10{sup {minus}5}{approx lt}{ital x}{lt}1, 0.3{approx lt}{ital q}{sup 2}{approx lt}10{sup 6} gev{sup 2} as obtained from the leading- and higher-order evolution equations.
@background oral exposure to inorganic arsenic: evaluation of its carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects monomethylarsonic acid (mmav) and dimethylarsinic acid (dmav) are active ingredients in pesticidal products used mainly for weed control. mmav and dmav are also metabolites of inorganic arsenic, formed intracellularly, primarily in liver cells in a metabolic process of repeated reductions and oxidative methylations. inorganic arsenic is a known human carcinogen, inducing tumors of the skin, urinary bladder, and lung. however, a good animal model has not yet been found. although the metabolic process of inorganic arsenic appears to enhance the excretion of arsenic from the body, it also involves formation of methylated compounds of trivalent arsenic as intermediates. trivalent arsenicals (whether inorganic or organic) are highly reactive compounds that can cause cytotoxicity and indirect genotoxicity in vitro. dmav was found to be a bladder carcinogen only in rats and only when administered in the diet or drinking water at high doses. it was negative in a two-year bioassay in mice. mmav was negative in 2-year bioassays in rats and mice. the mode of action for dmav-induced bladder cancer in rats appears to not involve dna reactivity, but rather involves cytotoxicity with consequent regenerative proliferation, ultimately leading to the formation of carcinoma. this critical review responds to the question of whether dmav-induced bladder cancer in rats can be extrapolated to humans, based on detailed comparisons between inorganic and organic arsenicals, including their metabolism and disposition in various animal species. the further metabolism and disposition of mmav and dmav formed endogenously during the metabolism of inorganic arsenic is different from the metabolism and disposition of mmav and dmav from exogenous exposure. the trivalent arsenicals that are cytotoxic and indirectly genotoxic in vitro are hardly formed in an organism exposed to mmav or dmav because of poor cellular uptake and limited metabolism of the ingested compounds. furthermore, the evidence strongly supports a nonlinear dose-response relationship for the biologic processes involved in the carcinogenicity of arsenicals. based on an overall review of the evidence, using a margin-of-exposure approach for mmav and dmav risk assessment is appropriate. at anticipated environmental exposures to mmav and dmav, there is not likely to be a carcinogenic risk to humans.
@background cellular neurochemical characterization and subcellular localization of phospholipase c β1 in rat brain upon activation of receptors coupled to the gq subclass of g proteins, phospholipase c (plc)β hydrolyses membrane phospholipid to yield a pair of second messengers, inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate and 1,2‐diacylglycerol. of four plcβ isoforms, plcβ1 is transcribed predominantly in the telencephalon and its gene inactivation in mice impairs metabotropic glutamate receptor‐ and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor‐dependent hippocampal oscillations, endocannabinoid production in the hippocampus and barrel formation in the somatosensory cortex. here we examined cellular and subcellular distributions of plcβ1 in adult mouse brains. in the telencephalon, high levels of plcβ1 were observed in principal neurons, including pyramidal cells in the cortex and hippocampus, granule cells and mossy cells in the dentate gyrus, and medium spiny neurons in the caudate‐putamen, whereas most interneurons had low levels of or were negative for plcβ1 and, instead, expressed plcβ4. by immunofluorescence, tiny clusters of plcβ1 were distributed in somatodendritic compartments of principal neurons and positioned close to those of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m1 and diacylglycerol lipase‐α, respectively. immunoelectron microscopy revealed that plcβ1 was often associated with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, cell membrane or postsynaptic density. in particular, it was highly accumulated at the perisynapse of dendritic spines forming asymmetrical synapses. in the cerebellum, plcβ1 was generally low but was enriched in axons and dendrites of basket cells. these results suggest that plcβ1 is the key effector in telencephalic principal neurons and cerebellar interneurons. furthermore, the well‐orchestrated molecular arrangement appears to be the anatomical basis for the specificity, efficiency and convergence of the neuronal phosphoinositide signaling system.
@background the tc1/mariner dna transposons in the genome of mollusk littorina saxatilis a spontaneous white mutation recovered in drosophila mauritiana is unstable and reverts to normal eye color at a frequency greater than 4 per 1,000 x-chromosomes. germ line reversion occurs at a high rate in d. mauritiana males and in interspecific hybrid females, while the rate is depressed in d. mauritiana females. these events are not restricted to the germ line, as cases of variegated patterns of eye pigmentation, indicating somatic reversion, are recovered at a frequency comparable to that of the male germ line reversion rate. germ line reversion events are genetically stable, while the somatic variegation patterns are not heritable. the patterns of eye pigment variegation produced suggests that reversion events are occurring throughout development. whole genome dna digests blotted and probed with the cloned d. melanogaster white gene indicate that this unstable white mutation in d. mauritiana is associated with an insertion of dna that is lost upon reversion to wild type, indicating that this dna insert is in fact a transposable element.
@background epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, inhibits ebv-induced b lymphocyte transformation via suppression of rela acetylation. ikappabalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters nf-kappab dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. upon stimulation, nf-kappab moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including ikappabalpha. this newly synthesized ikappabalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated nf-kappab from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of nf-kappab activation. we show here that ikappabalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as hoxb7 and pit-1 through a nf-kappab-independent association with histone deacetylase (hdac) 1 and hdac3 but not with hdac2, -4, -5, and -6. ikappabalpha bound both hdac proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that ikappabalpha acts by partially redirecting hdac3 to the cytoplasm. at the same time, an ikappabalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with hdac1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of pit-1. our results support the hypothesis that the nf-kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of hdac1 and hdac3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to ikappabalpha.
@result revision surgery for failed unicompartmental knee replacement: technical aspects and clinical outcome. recent reports suggest good outcome results following unicompartmental knee replacement (ukr). however, a number of authors have commented on the problem of osseous defects requiring technically difficult revision surgery. we reviewed clinical outcomes following revision total knee replacement (tkr) for failed ukr and analysed the reasons for failure and the technical aspects of the revision surgery. between 2001 and 2010 our institute performed 132 ukr's out of which 33 required revision to tkr during a period 6 years. demographics, details and indications for primary and revision surgery, the revised prosthesis including augments, technical difficulties and complications were noted. patient outcome assessment was based on the oxford knee score (oks). survival analysis for the ukr prosthesis was calculated using kaplan-meier survival curves. reasons for revision included aseptic loosening, persistent pain, dislocated meniscus, mal-alignment and other compartment osteoarthritis. median time to revision was 19 months (range 2-159). using revision as the end-point the survival proportion at 5-years was 69%. 18 revisions required additional intra-operative constructs including stemmed implants, wedge augmentation or bone graft. the mean 1 year post-operative oks was 29 compared to 39 for primary tkr during the same period (p<0.001). aseptic loosening was the commonest mode of failure. ukr survivorship at a non-specialist institute is considerably lower than at originating centres. two thirds of the revisions were technically difficult and required additional constructs. the clinical outcome after revision surgery was inferior to that of primary tkr. the role of ukr needs to be more clearly defined.
@result quantitative assessment of the association between gstm1 null genotype and laryngeal cancer risk glutathione s-transferase (gst) isoenzymes are involved in the detoxification of several tobacco smoke-derived carcinogens. it is thus conceivable that deficiency in gst activity due to homozygous deletion of the gstm1 and gstt1 genes (the null genotypes) may modulate susceptibility to smoking-induced cancers. the effects of the gstm1 and gstt1 null genotypes on laryngeal cancer risk were evaluated using peripheral blood dna from 129 larynx cancer patients and 172 noncancer controls, all of whom were regular smokers. increased larynx cancer risk was related to the gstm1 null genotype [odds ratio (or) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.0-2.8]. the or associated with the gstt1 null genotype was increased, although not significantly (or = 1.4, 95% ci = 0.7-2.9). individuals with concurrent lack of gstm1 and gstt1 genes had a doubled, although not significant, risk for larynx cancer when compared with those having at least one of these genes (or = 2.0, 95% ci = 0.8-5.2) and had almost a 3-fold risk (or = 2.7, 95% ci = 1.0-7.4) when compared with those with both genes. moreover, a significant interaction between the gstm1 genotype and levels of tobacco consumption (p < 0.05) was found; the gstm1 null genotype was associated with an increased risk of larynx cancer among smokers of 20 g/day or less (or = 2.9, 95% ci = 1.3-6.3) but not among heavier smokers (or = 1.0; 95% ci = 0.5-2.0). in contrast, the gstt1 null genotype posed an increased, although not significant, risk among long-term smokers (or = 2.3, 95% ci = 0.9-5.4).
@background big data analytics with datalog queries on spark the management of web users' personal information is increasingly distributed across a broad array of applications and systems, including online social networks and cloud-based services. users wish to share data using these systems, but avoiding the risks of unintended disclosures or unauthorized access by applications has become a major challenge. we propose a novel access control model that operates within a distributed data management framework based on datalog. using this model, users can control access to data they own and control applications they run. they can conveniently specify access control policies providing flexible tuple-level control derived using provenance information. we present a formal specification of the model, an implementation built using an open-source distributed datalog engine, and an extensive experimental evaluation showing that the computational cost of access control is modest.
@background trait anxiety, state anxiety, and attentional bias to threat: assessing the psychometric properties of response time measures testing feasibility and efficacy of psychological treatment via mobile devices is important, given its potential benefits for high-dosage treatment delivery, widespread and inexpensive dissemination, and efficient research methods. we conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. all participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. participants completed weekly internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. the between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. on measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre–post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.
@background effects of electrostimulation and plyometric training program combination on jump height in teenage athletes. numerous studies have used percutaneous electrical stimulation (pes) in the context of training programs to develop strength and physical performance in healthy populations (sedentary or trained). significant increases in muscle and fiber cross-sectional area, isokinetic peak torque, maximal isometric and dynamic strength, and motor performance skills have been found after pes training. these strength gains are explained on the basis of the characteristics of pes motor units (mus) recruitment: (a) a continuous and exhausting contractile activity in the same pool of mus during the entire exercise period, (b) a supramaximal temporal recruitment imposed by the high frequency chosen (up to 40 hz), and (c) a synchronous recruitment of neighboring fibers. the pes training method is complementary to voluntary training, mainly because the application of pes causes an unconventional spatial recruitment of mus that, depending on the muscular topography, may entail the preferential recruitment of the fast-twitch mus. in addition, the method does not specifically develop elasticity in skeletal muscle, and it must be accompanied by a technical workout.
@method patients with spinal deformity over the age of 75: a retrospective analysis of operative versus non-operative management purpose of the study parameters determining sagittal balance are essential for optimal analysis and treatment of many spinal disorders. the purpose of this work was to validate a software designed to measure the principal parameters involved in sagittal balance of the spine.   material and methods six parameters (lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, sagittal tilt at t9, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, slope of the sacrum) were measured on lateral views of the spine from 100 healthy volunteers free of any spinal disease. two measurement techniques were used: manual measurement and automatic computerized measurement with this software. we hypothesized that manual measures could be accepted as reference values because they are currently the most widely used and because the computerized measurements were obtained using digitalized images that may have modified interpretation. the software was therefore validated by comparing the angles measured manually with the computer output. inter- and intraobserver coefficients of variation were calculated for the two measurement techniques. one operator performed both series of measurements (manual and computerized). two other operators preformed two series of independent measures using one of the measurement techniques. finally, two new operators performed a complete series of measurements using both measurement techniques. comparisons were performed with the t test for paired variables with calculation of the coefficients of correlation. intraclass coefficients of correlation were determined for inter- and intra-observer variability.   results there was an excellent correlation between the manual measurements and the computerized measurements with intra-class coefficients of correlation varying from 0.82 to 0.96. inter- and intra-observer variabilities were comparable for the two measurement techniques used to determine thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, and slope of the sacrum. inter- and intra-observer variability was lower when the sagittal tilt was measured with the software specially designed.   conclusion this comparison between two techniques for measuring pelvic and spinal parameters of sagittal balance of the spine demonstrated a good correlation between manual and the computerized measurements obtained with the software to be evaluated. computer-assisted measurements not only provided a saving in time but also minimized inter- and intra-observer variability for the estimation of certain parameters.
@background arachidonic acid-induced apoptosis in rat hepatoma as-30d cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species. arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
@method the use of colour in reference production: a comparison between dutch and greek we examine the problem of generating definite noun phrases that are appropriate referring expressions; that is, noun phrases that (a) successfully identify the intended referent to the hearer whilst (b) not conveying to him or her any false conversational implicatures (grice, 1975). we review several possible computational interpretations of the conversational implicature maxims, with different computational costs, and argue that the simplest may be the best, because it seems to be closest to what human speakers do. we describe our recommended algorithm in detail, along with a specification of the resources a host system must provide in order to make use of the algorithm, and an implementation used in the natural language generation component of the idas system.
@method integrative analysis with chip-seq advances the limits of transcript quantification from rna-seq. histones are frequently decorated with covalent modifications. these histone modifications are thought to be involved in various chromatin-dependent processes including transcription. to elucidate the relationship between histone modifications and transcription, we derived quantitative models to predict the expression level of genes from histone modification levels. we found that histone modification levels and gene expression are very well correlated. moreover, we show that only a small number of histone modifications are necessary to accurately predict gene expression. we show that different sets of histone modifications are necessary to predict gene expression driven by high cpg content promoters (hcps) or low cpg content promoters (lcps). quantitative models involving h3k4me3 and h3k79me1 are the most predictive of the expression levels in lcps, whereas hcps require h3k27ac and h4k20me1. finally, we show that the connections between histone modifications and gene expression seem to be general, as we were able to predict gene expression levels of one cell type using a model trained on another one.
@method in silico, experimental, mechanistic model for extended-release felodipine disposition exhibiting complex absorption and a highly variable food interaction absorption models used in the estimation of pharmacokinetic drug characteristics from plasma concentration data are generally empirical and simple, utilizing no prior information on gastro-intestinal (gi) transit patterns. our aim was to develop and evaluate an estimation strategy based on a mechanism-based model for drug absorption, which takes into account the tablet movement through the gi transit. this work is an extension of a previous model utilizing tablet movement characteristics derived from magnetic marker monitoring (mmm) and pharmacokinetic data. the new approach, which replaces mmm data with a gi transit model, was evaluated in data sets where mmm data were available (felodipine) or not available (diclofenac). pharmacokinetic profiles in both datasets were well described by the model according to goodness-of-fit plots. visual predictive checks showed the model to give superior simulation properties compared with a standard empirical approach (first-order absorption rate + lag-time). this model represents a step towards an integrated mechanism-based nlme model, where the use of physiological knowledge and in vitro–in vivo correlation helps fully characterize pk and generate hypotheses for new formulations or specific populations.
@background hiv-1/parasite co-infection and the emergence of new parasite strains. using dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we identified four distinct cryptosporidium genotypes in hiv-infected patients: genotype 1 (human), genotype 2 (bovine) cryptosporidium parvum, a genotype identical to c. felis, and one identical to a cryptosporidium sp. isolate from a dog. this is the first identification of human infection with the latter two genotypes.
@background verifying synchronization for atomicity violation fixing fixing software bugs has always been an important and time-consuming process in software development. fixing concurrency bugs has become especially critical in the multicore era. however, fixing concurrency bugs is challenging, in part due to non-deterministic failures and tricky parallel reasoning. beyond correctly fixing the original problem in the software, a good patch should also avoid introducing new bugs, degrading performance unnecessarily, or damaging software readability. existing tools cannot automate the whole fixing process and provide good-quality patches.  we present afix, a tool that automates the whole process of fixing one common type of concurrency bug: single-variable atomicity violations. afix starts from the bug reports of existing bug-detection tools. it augments these with static analysis to construct a suitable patch for each bug report. it further tries to combine the patches of multiple bugs for better performance and code readability. finally, afix's run-time component provides testing customized for each patch. our evaluation shows that patches automatically generated by afix correctly eliminate six out of eight real-world bugs and significantly decrease the failure probability in the other two cases. afix patches never introduce new bugs and usually have similar performance to manually-designed patches.
@background does male care, provided to immature individuals, influence immature fitness in rhesus macaques? in chacma baboons (papio hamadryas ursinus), adult males and lactating females form preferential associations, or ‘friendships’, that provide protection against potentially infanticidal attacks. little is known about the mechanisms by which males and females form friendships, or the function of friendships for males. we examined the relationship between mating activity, paternity and friendships over a 3-year period. a male’s proportion of consort activity with a female within and outside of her period of most likely conception, along with his dominance rank, each contributed importantly in models of paternity outcomes and formation of friendships. in 87% of births, the male that monopolized the greatest proportion of a female’s consort days during her last conceptive cycle was the father of her offspring. in 82% of the births where the female’s primary consort partner was present at parturition, he became her friend. when the primary consort partner was absent at parturition, females formed friendships with males that had monopolized the second or third greatest proportion of their previous consort days. similarly, 78% of males became friends with females with whom they had obtained their greatest consort success. such a flexible strategy based on probabilistic assessment of paternity may be adaptive for females, given unpredictable fluctuations in male presence within the group. in a mating system with high dominance-based reproductive skew, males may benefit by investing preferentially in those infants that they are most likely to have fathered.
@background abstract stimulus-specific adaptation models neurons in the primary auditory cortex respond less strongly to a commonly occurring “standard” tone than to the same tone when it is rare or “deviant.” this phenomenon, called “stimulus-specific adaptation” (ssa), has been proposed as a possible single-neuron correlate of the mismatch negativity, a cortical evoked potential associated with stimulus novelty. previous studies in cat did not observe ssa in single neurons in the auditory thalamus. however, these reports did not differentiate between the auditory thalamic subdivisions and did not examine the effects of changing the stimulus presentation rate. to explore the possibility of thalamic ssa more completely, we recorded extracellularly from 30 single units and 22 multiunit clusters in the ventral, medial, and dorsal subdivisions of the mouse medial geniculate body (mgb), while presenting the anesthetized animals with sequences of standard and deviant tones at interstimulus intervals of 400, 500 and 800 ms. we found ssa in the auditory thalamus at all three stimulus presentation rates, primarily in the medial subdivision but to a lesser degree also in the ventral mgb. thalamic ssa was evident from the earliest onset of tone-evoked activity, although the latencies of responses to standard and deviant tones were not significantly different. together with related findings of ssa in neurons of the “belt” regions of the inferior colliculus, these results demonstrate that ssa is present at subcortical levels, primarily in but not restricted to the nonlemniscal auditory pathway.
@result one-year mortality after severe copd exacerbation in bulgaria the aim of this study was to assess long-term mortality and predictive factors of death after hospital admission for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). 1824 patients (23.2% female; mean age 70.3±11.3 years) consecutively admitted for acute exacerbation of copd in the respiratory medicine departments of 68 general hospitals between october 2006 and june 2007 were prospectively enrolled in a follow-up cohort. their vital status was documented between october 2010 and april 2011. vital status was available for 1750 patients (95.9%), among whom 787 (45%) died during follow-up. multivariate analysis found that age (60–80 years and ≥80 years versus <60 years, relative risk 2.99, 95% ci 2.31–3.89), lower body mass index (25–30 kg·m−2 versus ≤20 kg·m−2, relative risk 0.80, 95% ci 0.66–0.97), lung cancer (relative risk 2.08, 95% ci 1.43–3.01), cardiovascular comorbidity (relative risk 1.35, 95% ci 1.16–1.58), previous hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of copd (four or more versus none, relative risk 1.91, 95% ci 1.44–2.53), use of accessory respiratory muscles (relative risk 1.19, 95% ci 1.01–1.40) or lower-limb oedema (relative risk 1.74, 95% ci (1.44–2.12)) at admission and treatment by long-term oxygen therapy at discharge (relative risk 2.09, 95% ci 1.79–2.45) were independent risk factors of death. mortality rate during the 4 years following hospital admission for acute exacerbation of copd was high (45%). simple clinical information relating to respiratory and general status can help in identifying high-risk patients and targeting more intensive follow-up and care. interestingly, cardiovascular comorbidities and past hospitalisations for acute exacerbation of copd, but not forced expiratory volume in 1 s, independently predicted the risk of death. long-term risk of death after hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of copd is high but can be readily identified http://ow.ly/li4gz
@background cyclin d1 promotes mitogen-independent cell cycle progression in hepatocytes. in tissue culture systems, p21 and p27 inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity and cell cycle progression in response to numerous stimuli, but little is known about their involvement in cell growth in vivo. we examined the modulation of cdk activity by these proteins after 70% partial hepatectomy (ph), an in vivo model of synchronous hepatocyte cell cycle progression. after ph in balb/c mice, p21 was induced during the prereplicative (g1) phase and was maximally expressed after peak hepatocyte dna synthesis. p27 was present in quiescent liver and was minimally induced after ph. p21 and p27 immunoprecipitated with cdk2, cdk4, and cyclin d1 in the regenerating liver. the activity of cdk2-, cdk4- and cyclin d1-associated kinases was upregulated after ph, and maximal activity of these enzyme complexes corresponded to peak dna synthesis. immunodepletion experiments suggested that p27 plays a role in downregulating cdk2 activity before and after peak dna synthesis. compared to cogenic wild-type mice, p21−/− mice demonstrated evidence of markedly accelerated hepatocyte progression through g1 phase after ph: dna synthesis, upregulation of cyclin a and pcna, induction of cyclin d1- and cdk2-associated kinase activity, and appearance of a phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (rb) species occurred earlier in the p21−/− mice. these results suggest that p21 and p27 modulate cdk activity in the regenerating liver, and that p21 regulates the rate of progression through g1 phase of the cell cycle in vivo.
@background global biogeography and local adaptation of streptomyces understanding how microbial genotypes are arrayed in space is crucial for identifying local factors that may influence the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. in this study we investigated variation in 16s rdna sequences and rep-pcr fingerprints of streptomyces stains isolated from prairie soil among three locations and four soil depths. substantial variation in streptomyces otu (operational taxonomic unit) and box-pcr fingerprint diversity was found among locations within a limited spatial area (1 m2). further, phylogenetic lineages at each location were distinct. however, there was little variation in genetic diversity among isolates from different soil depths and similar phylogenetic lineages were found at each depth. some clones were found at a localized scale while other clones had a relatively widespread distribution. there was poor correspondence between 16s rdna groupings and rep-pcr fingerprint groupings. the finding of distinct phylogenetic lineages and the variation in spatial distribution of clones suggests that selection pressures may vary over the soil landscape.
@background global signal modulation of single-trial fmri response variability: effect on positive vs negative bold response relationship the primary somatosensory cortex (si) has been shown to encode the intensity of a stimulus applied to the contralateral side of the body. recent studies have demonstrated that ipsilateral si is also involved in the processing of somatosensory information. in this study, we investigated the dependence of the negative bold response in ipsilateral si on the intensity of somatosensory stimulation. functional mri was performed in 12 healthy subjects during electrical median nerve stimulation at four different intensities. a monotonic relationship between stimulus intensity and the strength of the negative bold response in ipsilateral si was found. additionally, a psychophysiological experiment revealed tight coupling between the stimulus intensity applied to one hand and increased perceptual threshold of the other hand. these findings indicate a stimulus intensity-dependent inhibition of ipsilateral si.
@background factors associated with men’s assessment of prostate cancer treatment choice patients diagnosed with localized prostate carcinoma need to interpret complicated medical information to make an informed treatment selection from among treatments that have comparable efficacy but differing side effects. the authors reported initial results for treatment decision‐making strategies among men receiving definitive treatment for localized prostate carcinoma.
@background patterning of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived pan-mesoderm by activin a/nodal and bmp4 signaling requires fibroblast growth factor activity. the vertebrate fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, fgf8a and fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for fgf receptors. to investigate the in vivo requirement for fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing fgf8b expression in mice. analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. we show that the loss of fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (e) 6.5. importantly, fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as fgf8b-deficient embryos at e6.5, demonstrating that signaling by fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. by contrast, during gastrulation, fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of fgf8b in mesoderm specification. we show that an increased level of fgf8a expression, which leads to fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of fgf8b. therefore, different fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. importantly, our findings implicate fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.
@background drinking water turbidity and emergency department visits for gastrointestinal illness in atlanta, 1993–2004 study objective to investigate the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of philadelphia. design within the general population, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. this study investigates the potential association between daily fluctuations in drinking water turbidity and subsequent hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness of elderly persons, controlling for time trends, seasonal patterns, and temperature using poisson regression analysis. setting and participants all residents of philadelphia aged 65 and older in 1992–1993 were studied through their medicare records. main results for philadelphia's population aged 65 and older, we found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase (95% ci 5.3%, 12.7%). in the belmont service area, there was also an association evident at a lag of 4 to 6 days (9.1% increase, 95% ci 5.2, 13.3). both associations were stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. this association occurred in a filtered water supply in compliance with us standards. conclusions elderly residents of philadelphia remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices. hospitalisations represent a very small percentage of total morbidity.
@background theory of mind deficit in subjects with alcohol use disorder: an analysis of mindreading processes. a growing body of literature views theory of mind (tom) as a complex activity involving related but different abilities (e.g., harrington, siegert, & mcclure, 2005; saxe, moran, scholz, & gabrieli, 2006; tirassa, bosco, & colle, 2006). this reflects in the types of experimental tasks that have been proposed in recent years for the assessment of tom in normal and abnormal populations, some of which focus on the ability to understand visual or other perceptual cues as hints to another individual’s mental states (e.g., baron-cohen, wheelwright, hill, raste, & plumb 2001; rutherford, baron-cohen, & wheelwright, 2002; golan, baron-cohen, hill, & rutherford, 2007) and others on the comprehension of complex mental states as encapsulated in short stories or linguistic questions (e.g., baron-cohen, o’riordan, stone, jones & plaitsed, 1999; happé, 1994; pons & harris, 2000). let us discriminate two facets of labels like tom or mindreading. one is the situated ability to understand and react to someone’s mental states (‘‘this thug is planning to assault me – i had better let him see that i carry a knife”); roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the first type of experimental tasks mentioned above. another is the retrospective reconsideration of one’s own or another individual’s ways or ability to cope with mentalistic social cognition (‘‘i always feel in danger when people conceal their thoughts”); again roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the second type of tasks. each facet may be further analyzed according to more detailed considerations like the distinction between an egocentric and an allocentric perspective or between the various types of epistemic, volitional and other mental states that humans may understand. particularly in developmental psychology, the difference between on-line and retrospective aspects of tom has also been compared to the distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge or functioning of tom (e.g., clements & perner, 1994); however, the latter distinction is often used intuitively, leaving many theoretical questions open (dienes & perner, 1999). to sum up, tom may be viewed as a sophisticated mental activity which allows to quickly form and handle local, situated ideas about oneself or the others in a specific moment as well as more general, less transient ideas about how one and the others tend to live and cope across any number of different and possibly hypothetical situations. both facets of tom have been a focus of research, but, to our knowledge, the conceptual and theoretical relations between them have never been worked out to any satisfactory level of detail and, as discussed above, the experimental paradigms with which they have been studied are quite different. the th.o.m.a.s. interview (bosco et al., 2009) is meant to investigate the retrospective facet of tom, based on a theoretically-driven decomposition thereof that aims at bringing its diversity and complexity into light. there is no way of doing this without recurring to the interviewee’s deliberate introspection and discursive abilities. it is possible that, as badgaiyan (2009) suggests, schizophrenia might affect differently the two facets of tom. yet, there is no reason to think that either one has a systematically more important causal role than the other in the mental life of a healthy or schizophrenic person. instead, they influence each other: the retrospective ability has to build in part upon the reconsideration of previous episodes and situations in which the on-line interpretation of mental states has yielded some interesting lesson to learn; conversely, the on-line interpretation of the current situation has to be informed in part by the individual’s general worldview and biography as well as by the outcomes of and reflections upon situations met in the past. we believe that the retrospective facet of tom plays a fundamental role and that it is crucial to our understanding of social cognition in schizophrenia and elsewhere. another issue raised by badgaiyan concerns the role that memory, language and iq may play in tom activities and in the relevant experimental tasks. truly, certain such activities and tasks require an adequate level of non-tom cognitive function-
@background degradation of mixtures of phenolic compounds by arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.
@method biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass. abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
@method characteristics of the bovicin hj 50 gene cluster in streptococcus bovis hj 50 three thermosensitive (ts) suicide vectors, pset4s, pset5s, and pset6s, have been constructed for gene replacement in streptococcus suis. each vector contains an antibiotic-resistance gene (spc or cat), a ts replication origin of pwv01 lineage, multiple cloning sites, lacz', and the cole1 replication origin of puc19. these vectors could be propagated at 37 degrees c in escherichia coli, but their replication was blocked above 37 degrees c in s. suis. moreover, the thermosensitivity of the replication origin was confirmed in s. equi ssp. equi, s. equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and s. dysgalactiae by using pset4s. for inactivation of the sly gene, which encodes a thiol-activated hemolysin of s. suis, pslyk, in which the sly gene was interrupted by the cat gene, was constructed using pset4s and introduced into s. suis dat2. after growth at the nonpermissive temperature under the antibiotic pressure, the chromosomal sly gene was replaced with the sly::cat gene of pslyk by a double-crossover event at a rate of 2.6% among chloramphenicol-resistant cells. moreover, complementation of the sly gene by use of the previously reported s. suis-e. coli shuttle vector pset2 was demonstrated. these results indicate that the ts suicide vectors described here will facilitate the genetic analysis of s. suis and other streptococci of veterinary importance by means of allelic exchange of the genes of interest via homologous recombination.
@background complementary roles of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma in inducible microglial nitric oxide generation we have reported recently that sodium butyrate suppressed ifn-gamma, but not the lps-mediated induction of nitric oxide and tnf-alpha in microglia via the specific inhibition of nf-kappab. in order to further determine the upstream signaling mechanism involved in the ifn-gamma-specific down-regulation of inos by sodium butyrate in microglia, this study investigated the effect of sodium butyrate on the map kinase activities. sodium butyrate significantly repressed the phosphorylation of erk induced by ifn-gamma, but had little effect on that induced by lps. this suggests that sodium butyrate suppresses the ifn-gamma-induced inos expression by inhibiting the erk to nf-kappab pathway. in addition, it was found that sodium butyrate suppressed the ifn-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (irf-1) expression via the inhibition of erk. therefore, the erk signaling pathway appears to play a key role in the sodium butyrate-mediated down-regulation of inos in the ifn-gamma-stimulated microglia.
@background equity and efficiency in multi-worker firms: insights from experimental economics we study how different payment modes influence the effectiveness of gift exchange as a contract enforcement device. in particular, we analyze how horizontal fairness concerns affect performance and efficiency in an environment characterized by contractual incompleteness. in our experiment, one principal is matched with two agents. the principal pays equal wages in one treatment and can set individual wages in the other. we find that the use of equal wages elicits substantially lower efforts. this is not caused by monetary incentives per se since under both wage schemes it is profit-maximizing for agents to exert high efforts. the treatment difference instead seems to be driven by the fact that the norm of equity is violated far more frequently in the equal wage treatment. after having suffered from violations of the equity principle, agents withdraw effort. these findings hold even after controlling for the role of intentions, as we show in a third treatment. our results suggest that adherence to the norm of equity is a necessary prerequisite for successful establishment of gift-exchange relations.
@background surgical treatment of advanced heart failure: alternatives to heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory assist devices. objectives the purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcome in two groups of patients with chronic severe aortic regurgitation (ar): those operated on early and those operated on late according to the guidelines.   background the impact of earlier surgery for chronic severe ar as defined in guidelines has not been evaluated.   methods a total of 170 patients with chronic severe ar submitted to aortic valve replacement were prospectively followed up. patients were divided in two groups depending on the clinical situation at the time of surgery. group a were 60 patients who were operated on following guidelines advice of earlier surgery, and group b were 110 patients who were operated on late with regard to guideline recommendations.   results follow-up was 10 +/- 6 years (1 to 22 years). during follow-up 44 patients died, 7 patients (12%) from group a and 37 (37%) from group b (p = 0.001). the cause of death was non-cardiac in 11 patients, 2 (3%) in group a and 9 (8%) in group b. cardiac deaths occurred in 33 patients, 5 (9%) from group a and 28 (28%) from group b (p = 0.002). causes of death differed between groups a and b: heart failure or sudden death were significantly more frequent in group b (20 patients vs. 1 patient, p = 0.001). overall survival in groups a and b was 90 +/- 4% vs. 75 +/- 8% at 5 years, 86 +/- 5% vs. 64 +/- 5% at 10 years, and 78 +/- 7% vs. 53 +/- 6% at 15 years, respectively (p = 0.009).   conclusions early operation as defined in the guidelines improves long-term survival in patients with chronic ar.
@method nutrient intake and nutritional status of newly diagnosed patients with cancer from the east coast of peninsular malaysia arm muscle area (ama, cm2) is currently calculated from triceps skinfold thickness (tsf, cm), and midarm circumference (mac, cm). in assessing the accuracy of the current equation by comparison to ama measured by computerized axial tomography, error in each of the four approximations made was found to result in a 20 to 25% overestimate of ama. two correctible error sources were: a 10 to 15% overestimation caused by assuming a circular midarm muscle compartment and a 5 to 10% overestimation due to inclusion of midarm cross-sectional bone area. corrected ama equations for men and women were respectively: [(mac - pi x tsf)2/4 pi] - 10, and [mac - pi x tsf)2/4 pip] - 6.5. with two additional study groups, the overall improved accuracy of the new equations was confirmed, although the average error for a given patient was 7 to 8%; the relationship between corrected ama and total body muscle mass was established [muscle mass (kg) = (ht, cm2) (0.0264 + 0.0029 x corrected ama)]; and the minimal range of corrected ama values compatible with survival (9 to 11 cm2) was defined. bedside estimates of undernutrition severity and prognosis can therefore be calculated from two simple measurements, tsf and mac.
@method dietary red meat aggravates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice whereas resistant starch attenuates inflammation background: we have previously demonstrated that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (dp) activity partially attenuates dextran sulfate sodium (dss) colitis in mice. the aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanisms of this protection. materials and methods: wildtype (wt) and dpiv−/− mice consumed 2% dss in drinking water for 6 days to induce colitis. mice were treated with saline or the dp inhibitors ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa or ile‐thia. dp mrna and enzyme levels were measured in the colon. glucagon‐like peptide (glp)‐2 and glp‐1 concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay, regulatory t‐cells (tregs) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (facs) on foxp3+t cells in blood, and neutrophil infiltration assessed by myeloperoxidase (mpo) assay. results: dp8 and dp2 mrna levels were increased (p < 0.05) in wt+saline mice compared to untreated wt mice with colitis. cytoplasmic dp enzyme activity was increased (p < 0.05) in dpiv−/− mice at day 6 of dss, while dp2 activity was increased (p < 0.05) in wt mice with colitis. glp‐1 (63%) and glp‐2 (50%) concentrations increased in wt+ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa mice compared to day‐0 controls. mpo activity was lower in wt+ile‐thia and wt+ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa treated mice compared to wt+saline (p < 0.001) at day 6 colitis. conclusions: dp expression and activity are differentially regulated during dss colitis, suggesting a pathophysiological role for these enzymes in human inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). dp inhibitors impaired neutrophil recruitment and maintenance of the treg population during dss‐colitis, providing further preclinical evidence for the potential therapeutic use of these inhibitors in ibd. finally, dpiv appears to play a critical role in mediating the protective effect of dp inhibitors. inflamm bowel dis 2010
@background optimization of molecular approaches to genogroup neisseria meningitidis carriage isolates and implications for monitoring the impact of new serogroup b vaccines background in 1999, meningococcal serogroup c conjugate (mcc) vaccines were introduced in the united kingdom for those under 19 years of age. the impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred.   methods multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping.   results a reduction in serogroup c carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (st)-11 complex serogroup c meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression.   conclusions the impact of vaccination with mcc vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group c meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. the high impact on the carriage of st-11 complex serogroup c could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. high vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups.
@background effects of corn particle size and physical form of the diet on the gastrointestinal structures of broiler chickens diets were prepared with corn, wheat, or sorghum ground in a hammer mill and sieved to obtain coarse, medium, and fine particle size fractions. their effect on broiler performance from hatch to 7 d and from 7 to 21 d of age was studied. the effect of particle size on the size and ph of the gastrointestinal organs was also determined. the three textures obtained for each grain were uniform in geometric mean diameter (gmd) and geometric standard deviation (gsd). grain by texture interactions were not significant. independent of grain source, the best performance was obtained with diets prepared from the medium texture. in these diets, the gmd of the grains varied from 1.13 to 1.23 mm and the gsd from 1.19 to 1.35. the fine fraction (gmd .57 to .67 mm) resulted in the lowest performance and that resulting from the coarse fraction (gmd 2.01 to 2.10 mm) was intermediate. at 7 and 21 d of age, gizzard weight and content were positively related to particle size. at the age of 21 d, duodenum weight and content was highest in chicks fed the fine diets. the ph of the gizzard content decreased with increasing grain particle size, whereas that of the small intestinal content increased. some grain effects were also observed on the gastrointestinal tract. gizzard weight was greatest in the cornfed birds. wheat-fed chicks had the heavier intestines and contents. after overnight feed deprivation, feed consumption by 7-d-old chicks was related to the particle size during the first 2 h of refeeding, with greater intake of medium and coarse grains.
@result kin effects on energy allocation in group-living ground squirrels. since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
@background efficiency of transcriptional gene silencing of gbssi in potato depends on the promoter region that is used in an inverted repeat two distinct gene-silencing phenomena are observed in plants: transcriptional gene silencing (tgs), which involves decreased rna synthesis because of promoter methylation, and posttranscriptional gene silencing (ptgs), which involves sequence-specific rna degradation. ptgs is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (r.v.b., unpublished data) of double-stranded rna (dsrna). tgs could be the result of dna pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsrna, as was shown by the dsrna-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in petunia, transgenes expressing dsrna can induce ptgs when coding sequences are used and tgs when promoter sequences are taken. for both types of silencing, small rna species are found, which are thought to be dsrna decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of dna sequences that are homologous to dsrna. dna methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating tgs and important for reinforcing ptgs [10]. therefore, we conclude that tgs and ptgs are mechanistically related. in addition, we show that dsrna-induced tgs provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the tgs of a ptgs-inducing transgene fully revert the ptgs phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsrna corresponding to its promoter.
@background costal2 functions as a kinesin-like protein in the hedgehog signal transduction pathway axoplasm from the squid giant axon contains a soluble protein translocator that induces movement of microtubules on glass, latex beads on microtubules, and axoplasmic organelles on microtubules. we now report the partial purification of a protein from squid giant axons and optic lobes that induces these microtubule-based movements and show that there is a homologous protein in bovine brain. the purification of the translocator protein depended primarily on its unusual property of forming a high affinity complex with microtubules in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable atp analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. the protein, once released from microtubules with atp, migrates on gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight of 600 kilodaltons and contains 110-120 and 60-70 kilodalton polypeptides. this protein is distinct in molecular weight and enzymatic behavior from myosin or dynein, which suggests that it belongs to a novel class of force-generating molecules, for which we propose the name kinesin.
@method double auction-inspired meta-scheduling of parallel applications on global grids many research and engineering fields, like bioinformatics or particle physics, are confident about the development of grid technologies to provide the huge amounts of computational and storage resources they require. although several projects are working on creating a reliable infrastructure consisting of persistent resources and services, the truth is that the grid will be a more and more dynamic entity as it grows. in this paper, we present a new tool that hides the complexity and dynamicity of the grid from developers and users, allowing the resolution of large computational experiments in a grid environment by adapting the scheduling and execution of jobs to the changing grid conditions and application dynamic demands.
@background an analysis of large-strain damage elastoplasticity in this paper a scalar-valued isotropic tensor function is considered, the variables of which are constitutive tensors of orders two and four, for instance, characterizing the anisotropic properties of a material. therefore, the system of irreducible invariants of a fourth-order tensor is constructed. furthermore, the joint or simultaneous invariants of a second-order and a fourth-order tensor are found. in a similar way one can construct an integrity basis for a tensor of order greater than four, as shown in the paper, for instance, for a tensor of order six.
@background nmda receptor regulation prevents regression of visual cortical function in the absence of mecp2 motor and cognitive functions are severely impaired in rett syndrome (rtt). here, we examined local synaptic circuits of layer 2/3 (l2/3) pyramidal neurons in motor-frontal cortex of male hemizygous mecp2-null mice at 3 to 4weeks of age. we mapped local excitatory input to l2/3 neurons using glutamate uncaging and laser scanning photostimulation, and compared synaptic input maps recorded from mecp2-null and wild type (wt) mice. local excitatory input was significantly reduced in the mutants. the strongest phenotype was observed for lateral (horizontal, intralaminar) inputs, that is, l2/3-->2/3 inputs, which showed a large reduction in mecp2(-/y) animals. neither the amount of local inhibitory input to these l2/3 pyramidal neurons nor their intrinsic electrophysiological properties differed by genotype. our findings provide further evidence that excitatory networks are selectively reduced in rtt. we discuss our findings in the context of recently published parallel studies using selective mecp2 knockdown in individual l2/3 neurons.
@result effect of methylphenidate in patients with cancer-related fatigue: a systematic review and meta-analysis abstract attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) often persists into adulthood. stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate, have showed efficacy in trials for adhd in adults. adult psychiatrists are likely to encounter increasing numbers of adult patients who may benefit from methylphenidate. a systematic review of the literature was made to examine the evidence on the safety of methylphenidate, when used therapeutically in adults. twenty-six placebo-controlled trials were found, in which 811 adults received methylphenidate for adhd and other conditions. in the short term, methylphenidate was well tolerated and no serious side effects were observed. there is little information on the long-term safety of methylphenidate in adults, although the number of serious adverse effects reported to regulatory authorities has, so far, been low. methylphenidate is associated with a modest rise in blood pressure and heart rate. surveys of stimulant use in us universities show that misuse of prescribed medication, for recreation or to enhance study, is fairly common although the level of harm that arises from this practice is unclear.
@method muscle na+-k+-atpase response during 16 h of heavy intermittent cycle exercise. the purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that a single, extended session of heavy exercise would be effective in inducing adaptations in energy metabolism during exercise in the absence of increases in oxidative potential. ten healthy males [maximal aerobic power (vo(2 peak)) = 43.4 +/- 2.2 (se) ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)] participated in a 16-h training session involving cycling for 6 min each hour at approximately 90% of maximal oxygen consumption. measurements of metabolic changes were made on tissue extracted from the vastus lateralis during a two-stage standardized submaximal cycle protocol before (pre) and 36-48 h after (post) the training session. at pre, creatine phosphate (pcr) declined (p < 0.05) by 32% from 0 to 3 min and then remained stable until 20 min of exercise at 60% vo(2 peak) before declining (p < 0.05) by a further 35% during 20 min of exercise at 75% vo(2 peak). muscle lactate (mmol/kg dry wt) progressively increased (p < 0.05) from 4.59 +/- 0.64 at 0 min to 17.8 +/- 2.7 and 30.9 +/- 5.3 at 3 and 40 min, respectively, whereas muscle glycogen (mmol glucosyl units/kg dry wt) declined (p < 0.05) from a rest value of 360 +/- 24 to 276 +/- 31 and 178 +/- 36 at similar time points. during exercise after the training session, pcr and glycogen were not as depressed (p < 0.05), and increases in muscle lactate were blunted (p < 0.05). all of these changes occurred in the absence of increases in oxidative potential as measured by the maximal activities of citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase. these findings are consistent with other studies, namely, that muscle metabolic adaptations to regular exercise are an early adaptive event that occurs before increases in oxidative potential.
@background foreground segmentation of live videos using locally competing 1svms this paper examines the problem of moving object detection. more precisely, it addresses the difficult scenarios where background scene textures in the video might change over time. in this paper, we formulate the problem mathematically as minimizing a constrained risk functional motivated from the large margin principle. it is a generalization of the one class support vector machines (1-svms) [17] to accommodate spatial interactions, which is further incorporated into an online learning framework to track temporal changes. as a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. we also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. by exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (gpus) to facilitate realtime analysis. our empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach works in realtime (over 80 frames per second) and at the same time performs competitively against state-of-the-art offline and quasi-realtime methods.
@method protecting personalized privacy against sensitivity homogeneity attacks over road networks in mobile services in this paper we discuss a new type of query in spatial databas es, called the trip planning query (tpq). given a set of points of interestp in space, where each point belongs to a specific category, a star ting points and a destinatione, tpq retrieves thebesttrip that starts at s, passes through at least one point from each category, and ends at e. for example, a driver traveling from boston to providence might want to stop to a gas station, a ban k and a post office on his way, and the goal is to provide him with the best possibl e route (in terms of distance, traffic, road conditions, etc.). the difficulty of this query lies in the existence of multiple choices per category. in this paper, w study fast approximation algorithms for tpq in a metric space. we provide a numb er of approximation algorithms with approximation ratios that depend o either the number of categories, the maximum number of points per category or b oth. therefore, for different instances of the problem, we can choose the alg orithm with the best approximation ratio, since they all run in polynomial time. furthermore, we use some of the proposed algorithms to derive efficient heuristi cs for large datasets stored in external memory. finally, we give an experimental ev luation of the proposed algorithms using both synthetic and real datasets .
@method the amount and integrity of mtdna in maize decline with development in maize (zea mays l.), chloroplast development progresses from the basal meristem to the mature leaf tip, and light is required for maturation to photosynthetic competence. during chloroplast greening, it was found that chloroplast dna (cpdna) is extensively degraded, falling to undetectable levels in many individual chloroplasts for three maize cultivars, as well as zea mexicana (the ancestor of cultivated maize) and the perennial species zea diploperennis. in dark-grown maize seedlings, the proplastid-to-etioplast transition is characterized by plastid enlargement, cpdna replication, and the retention of high levels of cpdna. when dark-grown seedlings are transferred to white light, the dna content per plastid increases slightly during the first 4 h of illumination and then declines rapidly to a minimum at 24 h during the etioplast-to-chloroplast transition. plastid autofluorescence (from chlorophyll) continues to increase as cpdna declines, whereas plastid size remains constant. it is concluded that the increase in cpdna that accompanies plastid enlargement is a consequence of cell and leaf growth, rather than illumination, whereas light stimulates photosynthetic capacity and cpdna instability. when cpdna from total tissue was monitored by blot hybridization and real-time quantitative pcr, no decline following transfer from dark to light was observed. the lack of agreement between dna per plastid and cpdna per cell may be attributed to nupts (nuclear sequences of plastid origin).
@background the tapeworm atractolytocestus tenuicollis (cestoda: caryophyllidea)—a sister species or ancestor of an invasive a. huronensis? the following caryophyllidean tapeworms were found in freshwater fishes from japan (species reported from japan for the first time marked with an asterisk): family caryophyllaeidae: paracaryophyllaeus gotoi (motomura, 1927) from misgurnus anguillicaudatus (cantor); archigetes sieboldi leuckart, 1878 from pseudorasbora parva (temminck et schlegel) and sarcocheilichthys variegatus microoculus mori (new hosts); family lytocestidae: *caryophyllaeides ergensi scholz, 1990 from tribolodon hakuensis (günther), t. ezoe okada et ikeda, hemibarbus barbus (temminck et schlegel) and chaenogobius sp. (new hosts); khawia japonensis (yamaguti, 1934) from cyprinus carpio linnaeus; k. sinensis hsü, 1935 from h. barbus (new host) and c. carpio; *k. parva (zmeev, 1936) from carassius auratus langsdorfii valenciennes in cuvier et valenciennes and carassius sp. (new hosts); and *atractolytocestus sagittatus (kulakovskaya et akhmerov, 1962) from c. carpio; family capingentidae: *breviscolex orientalis kulakovskaya, 1962 from h. barbus (new host); and caryophyllidea gen. sp. (probably breviscolex orientalis) from c. carpio. the validity of c. ergensi, originally described from leuciscus leuciscus baicalensis from mongolia, is confirmed on the basis of an evaluation of extensive material from japan. atractolytocestus sagittatus (syn. markevitschia sagittata) is tentatively considered a valid species, differing from the only congener, a. huronensis anthony, 1958, in its considerably greater number of testes.
@background sexual differences in responses to cross-species call interference in the green treefrog (hyla cinerea) in many species, males advertise to both male and female audiences. given the asymmetry in fitness costs of recognition errors in response to mating signals for the sexes, usually higher for females than males, males are expected to be more permissive than females in their responses to signals. few studies, however, have investigated such differences and there is no consensus on which sex is more permissive to signal variation. we examined the evoked vocal responses of male tungara frogs, physalaemus pustulosus, to 14 species of heterospecific and ancestral male mating calls to evaluate the influence of call similarity and phylogenetic distance on their responses. we also compared male calling responses to female phonotactic responses to examine the propensity of response errors between the sexes. recognition errors were higher for males than females, as predicted by the different costs associated with recognition errors for each sex. males responded to the calls of most species with mating calls, and produced aggressive calls in response to two other heterospecific/ancestral calls. the responses of males were explained by phylogenetic distance but not by overall call similarity. similarly, females were more likely to show phonotaxis to calls of species and ancestors that were more closely related. therefore, evolutionary history has left a perceptual footprint on the brain of both sexes but the details seem to differ. we discuss proximate reasons underlying sexual differences in receiver permissiveness in tungara frogs and potential factors leading to their evolution.
@method pilot implementation of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy in a university health setting objective while considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.   measurements the patient health questionnaire (phq) is a self-administered version of the prime-md diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. the phq-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 dsm-iv criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). the phq-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. construct validity was assessed using the 20-item short-form general health survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (mhp) interview in a sample of 580 patients.   results as phq-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 sf-20 subscales. also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. using the mhp reinterview as the criterion standard, a phq-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. phq-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.   conclusion in addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the phq-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. these characteristics plus its brevity make the phq-9 a useful clinical and research tool.
@background prevalence of amblyopia and refractive errors among primary school children purpose. to determine the prevalence of amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors in children entering school. methods. in this cross-sectional population-based study, 6-year-old children enrolling in shahrood schools were randomly sampled. those with organic blindness or mental retardation were excluded. ocular alignment, visual acuity, stereopsis, cover testing, and cycloplegic refraction were recorded for all children by an optometrist. a diagnosis of amblyopia was based on a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or less in one or both eyes, or a bilateral difference of at least two best-corrected visual acuity lines. results. a total of 902 children were invited for optometry examinations, among which 827 (91.7%) responded and 815 children (98.5%) were included in the study. the prevalence of significantly reduced visual acuity (uncorrected va ≤6/12 in either eye) and amblyopia was 3.6 and 1.7%, respectively. the prevalence of hyperopia (+2.00 d or worse), myopia (−0.50 d or worse), astigmatism (0.75 d or worse), and anisometropia (1.00 d or more) were 20.5, 1.7, 19.6, and 2.2%, respectively. significant refractive error, defined as hyperopia >+3.50 d, myopia >−3.00 d, astigmatism >1.50 d in the orthogonal meridian or >1.00 d in the oblique meridian, or anisometropia (hyperopic >1.00 d, myopic >3.00 d) was detected in 2.1, 0.1, 5.0, and 0.9% of the sample, respectively. strabismus was diagnosed in 1.2% of children. overall, 52 children (6.4%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 4.7–8.1%) were at risk of amblyopia; of these, 81% had significant refractive errors, 11% had strabismus, and 8% had both. conclusion. a considerable proportion of 6-year-old children have strabismus and/or significant, potentially amblyogenic refractive errors. the relatively high rate of hyperopia and astigmatism in the studied population needs more attention. the results of the study emphasize the need for adequate diagnostic and therapeutic eye care services for preschool children.
@background stimulus disparity and punisher control of human signal-detection performance. three experiments using human participants varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers or point-loss punishers in two-alternative signal-detection procedures. experiment 1 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses (group a) and point-loss punishers for errors (group b) across conditions. response bias varied systematically as a function of the relative reinforcer or punisher frequencies. experiment 2 arranged two conditions - one where an unequal ratio of reinforcement (5ratio1 or 1ratio5) was presented without punishment (r-only), and another where the same reinforcer ratio was presented with an equal distribution of point-loss punishers (r+p). response bias was significantly greater in the r-only condition than the r+p condition, supporting a subtractive model of punishment. experiment 3 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses across four unequal reinforcer ratios (5ratio1, 2ratio1, 1ratio2, 1ratio5) both without (r-only) and with (r+p) an equal distribution of point-loss punishers for errors. response bias varied systematically with changes in relative reinforcer frequency for both r-only and r+p conditions, with 5 out of 8 participants showing increases in sensitivity estimates from r-only to r+p conditions. overall, the results indicated that punishers have similar but opposite effects to reinforcers in detection procedures and that combined reinforcer and punisher effects might be better modeled by a subtractive punishment model than an additive punishment model, consistent with research using concurrent-schedule choice procedures.
@background rap1 and canoe/afadin are essential for establishment of apical–basal polarity in the drosophila embryo regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction is essential for the normal physiology of metazoans and is important in many diseases. integrin adhesion receptors can rapidly increase their affinity (integrin activation) in response to intracellular signaling events in a process termed inside-out signaling. the transmembrane domains of integrins and their interactions with the membrane are important in inside-out signaling. moreover, integrin activation is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. here, we review recent progress in understanding how the membrane environment can, in cooperation with integrin-binding proteins, regulate integrin activation.
@background ramadan fasting and maternal perspectives in healthy pregnant women : systematic review objectiveto determine the effects of fasting during the month of ramadan on fetal development and maternal serum cortisol and lipid profile.methodsthis study was performed in obstetrics and gynecology department of gaziantep university hospital, between 23 september 2006 and 23 october 2006 (during the month of ramadan). thirty-six consecutive healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of 20 weeks or more, who were fasting during ramadan, were included in the study group (group 1). the control group (group 2) consisted of 29 healthy pregnant women, who were not fasting during the study period. for evaluating ramadan’s effect on fetus, doppler ultrasonography was performed on all subjects in the beginning and then once a week until the end of ramadan for the following measurements: increase of fetal biparietal diameter (bpd), increase of fetal femur length (fl), increase of estimated fetal body weight (efbw), fetal biophysical profile (bpp), amniotic fluid index (afi), and umbilical artery systole/diastole (s/d) ratio.maternal serum cortisol, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (ldl), high-density lipoprotein (hdl), very low density lipoprotein (vldl), and ldl/hdl ratio were also evaluated before and after ramadan.resultsno significant difference was found between the two groups for the fetal age, maternal weight gain (kilogram), estimated fetal weight gain (efwg), fetal bpp, afi, and umbilical artery s/d ratio. in the fasting group, the maternal serum cortisol levels on day 20 were significantly higher than the initial levels obtained 1 week prior to ramadan (p < 0.05). although no significant increases were observed in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the fasting group, these increases were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). ldl and vldl levels showed a non-significant decrease at the end of the ramadan. hdl levels showed a slight increase, but ldl/hdl ratios were significantly decreased in fasting group (p < 0.05).conclusionthe results of this study showed that maternal serum cortisol level was elevated while ldl/hdl ratio were decreased in healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of 20 weeks or more, who were fasting during ramadan. no untoward effect of ramadan was observed on intrauterine fetal development.
@background energy landscapes shape microbial communities in hydrothermal systems on the arctic mid-ocean ridge numerical models are employed to investigate sources of chemical energy for autotrophic microbial metabolism that develop during mixing of oxidized seawater with strongly reduced fluids discharged from ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems on the seafloor. hydrothermal fluids in these systems are highly enriched in h(2) and ch(4) as a result of alteration of ultramafic rocks (serpentinization) in the subsurface. based on the availability of chemical energy sources, inferences are made about the likely metabolic diversity, relative abundance, and spatial distribution of microorganisms within ultramafic-hosted systems. metabolic reactions involving h(2) and ch(4), particularly hydrogen oxidation, methanotrophy, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis, represent the predominant sources of chemical energy during fluid mixing. owing to chemical gradients that develop from fluid mixing, aerobic metabolisms are likely to predominate in low-temperature environments (<20-30 degrees c), while anaerobes will dominate higher-temperature environments. overall, aerobic metabolic reactions can supply up to approximately 7 kj of energy per kilogram of hydrothermal fluid, while anaerobic metabolic reactions can supply about 1 kj, which is sufficient to support a maximum of approximately 120 mg (dry weight) of primary biomass production by aerobic organisms and approximately 20-30 mg biomass by anaerobes. the results indicate that ultramafic-hosted systems are capable of supplying about twice as much chemical energy as analogous deep-sea hydrothermal systems hosted in basaltic rocks.
@method α2-adrenoreceptor constraint of catecholamine release and blood pressure is enhanced in female spontaneously hypertensive rats α2-adrenoceptors (ar) lower central sympathetic output and peripheral catecholamine release, thereby protecting against sympathetic hyperactivity and hypertension. norepinephrine re-uptake–transporter effectively (net) removes norepinephrine from the synapse. overflow to plasma will therefore not reflect release. here we tested if inhibition of re-uptake allowed presynaptic α2ar release control to be reflected as differences in norepinephrine overflow in anesthetized hypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) and normotensive rats (wky). we also tested if α2ar modulated the experiment-induced epinephrine secretion, and a phenylephrine-induced, α1-adrenergic vasoconstriction. blood pressure was recorded through a femoral artery catheter, and cardiac output by ascending aorta flow. after pre-treatment with net inhibitor (desipramine), and/or α2ar antagonist (yohimbine, l-659,066) or agonist (clonidine, st-91), we injected phenylephrine. arterial blood was sampled 15 min later. plasma catecholamine concentrations were not influenced by phenylephrine, and therefore reflected effects of pre-treatment. desipramine and α2ar antagonist separately had little effect on norepinephrine overflow. combined, they increased norepinephrine overflow, particularly in shr. clonidine, but not st-91, reduced, and pertussis toxin increased norepinephrine overflow in shr and epinephrine secretion in both strains. l-659,066 + clonidine (central α2ar-stimulation) normalized the high blood pressure, heart rate, and vascular tension in shr. α2ar antagonists reduced phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction equally in wky and shr. conclusions: α2aar inhibition increased norepinephrine overflow only when re-uptake was blocked, and then with particular efficacy in shr, possibly due to their high sympathetic tone. α2aar inhibited epinephrine secretion, particularly in shr. α2aar supported α1ar-induced vasoconstriction equally in the two strains. α2ar malfunctions were therefore not detected in shr under this basal condition.
@background factor receptor signaling cancer by inducing anoikis resistance and augmenting growth loss of p120-catenin induces metastatic progression of breast dental enamel development occurs in stages. the ameloblast cell layer is adjacent to, and is responsible for, enamel formation. when rodent pre-ameloblasts become tall columnar secretory-stage ameloblasts, they secrete enamel matrix proteins, and the ameloblasts start moving in rows that slide by one another. this movement is necessary to form the characteristic decussating enamel prism pattern. thus, a dynamic system of intercellular interactions is required for proper enamel development. cadherins are components of the adherens junction (aj), and they span the cell membrane to mediate attachment to adjacent cells. p120 stabilizes cadherins by preventing their internalization and degradation. so, we asked if p120-mediated cadherin stability is important for dental enamel formation. targeted p120 ablation in the mouse enamel organ had a striking effect. secretory stage ameloblasts detached from surrounding tissues, lost polarity, flattened, and ameloblast e- and n-cadherin expression became undetectable by immunostaining. the enamel itself was poorly mineralized and appeared to be composed of a thin layer of merged spheres that abraded from the tooth. significantly, p120 mosaic mouse teeth were capable of forming normal enamel demonstrating that the enamel defects were not a secondary effect of p120 ablation. surprisingly, blood-filled sinusoids developed in random locations around the developing teeth. this has not been observed in other p120-ablated tissues and may be due to altered p120-mediated cell signaling. these data reveal a critical role for p120 in tooth and dental enamel development and are consistent with p120 directing the attachment and detachment of the secretory stage ameloblasts as they move in rows.
@method muscle cocontraction following dynamics learning cocontraction (the simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles around a joint) provides the nervous system with a way to adapt the mechanical properties of the limb to changing task requirements-both in statics and during movement. however, relatively little is known about the conditions under which the motor system modulates limb impedance through cocontraction. the goal of this study was to test for a possible relationship between cocontraction and movement accuracy in multi-joint limb movements. the electromyographic activity of seven single- and double-joint shoulder and elbow muscles was recorded using surface electrodes while subjects performed a pointing task in a horizontal plane to targets that varied randomly in size. movement speed was controlled by providing subjects with feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. measures of cocontraction were estimated both during movement and during a 200-ms window immediately following movement end. we observed an inverse relationship between target size and cocontraction: as target size was reduced, cocontraction activity increased. in addition, trajectory variability decreased and endpoint accuracy improved. this suggests that, although energetically expensive, cocontraction may be a strategy used by the motor system to facilitate multi-joint arm movement accuracy. we also observed a general trend for cocontraction levels to decrease over time, supporting the idea that cocontraction and associated limb stiffness are reduced over the course of practice.
@method silencing, positive selection and parallel evolution: busy history of primate cytochromes c rates of molecular evolution vary over time and, hence, among lineages. in contrast, widely used methods for estimating divergence times from molecular sequence data assume constancy of rates. therefore, methods for estimation of divergence times that incorporate rate variation are attractive. improvements on a previously proposed bayesian technique for divergence time estimation are described. new parameterization more effectively captures the phylogenetic structure of rate evolution on a tree. fossil information and other evidence can now be included in bayesian analyses in the form of constraints on divergence times. simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of divergence time estimation is substantially enhanced when constraints are included.
@method biomechanical analysis of defensive cutting actions during game situations: six cases in collegiate soccer competitions in many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. however, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. the aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. a laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. this provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. the test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 hz motion analysis system. root mean square (rms) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. rms velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the rms differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. in conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. the kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. this method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.
@background motivational effects of opiates in conditioned place preference and aversion paradigm—a study in three inbred strains of mice rationalein previous studies, we have demonstrated that mice of the inbred strain c57bl/6j (c57) are more susceptible to amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (cpp) than dba/2j (dba) mice. moreover, we also observed parallel strain differences for the locomotor-stimulant effects of the drug. however, other studies have reported either no difference or opposite strain differences for cocaine- and morphine-induced cpp as well as for the locomotor effects of these drugs, suggesting that amphetamine-related behavioral phenotypes might depend on a specific pharmacological action of the psychostimulant.objectivesthis study was aimed at testing strain differences for cocaine- and morphine-related behavioral phenotypes in the same experimental protocol and conditions previously used for amphetamine.methodsc57 and dba mice were tested for cpp induced by cocaine (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and morphine (0, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg). locomotor activity data were simultaneously obtained by measuring distance moved during all different cpp phases and unconditioned locomotor activity, behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity were measured together with cpp.results(a) either cocaine or morphine promoted significant cpp at lower doses in c57 than in dba mice; (b) only drug-trained c57 mice showed a significant cpp compared with the control group; and (c) only c57 mice showed dose-dependent effects of cocaine on cpp. moreover, there was no relationship between drug-induced cpp and locomotion.conclusionsthe results demonstrate that c57 and dba mice differ in their sensitivity to cocaine- and morphine-induced cpp and suggest that the two strains differ in sensitivity to the positive incentive properties of drugs of abuse.
@background particle impact on metal substrates with application to foreign object damage to aircraft engines the role of foreign-object damage (fod) and its effect on high-cycle fatigue (hgf) failures in a turbine engine ti– 6al–4v alloy is examined in the context of the use of the kitagawa–takahashi diagram to describe the limiting conditions for such failures. experimentally, fod is simulated by firing 1and 3.2 mm diameter steel spheres onto the flat specimen surface of tensile fatigue specimens at velocities of 200 and 300 m/s. such damage was found to markedly reduce the fatigue strength of the alloy, primarily due to four factors: stress concentration, microcrack formation, impact-induced plasticity and tensile residual stresses associated with the impact damage. two groups of fatigue failures could be identified. the first group initiated directly at the impact site, and can be readily described through the use of a fatigue-crack growth threshold concept. specifically, a kitagawa–takahashi approach is presented where the limiting threshold conditions are defined by the stress-concentration corrected smooth-bar fatigue limit (at microstructurally small crack sizes) and a ‘‘worst-case’’ fatigue-crack growth threshold (at larger crack sizes). the second group of failures was caused by fatigue cracks that initiated at locations far from the impact site in regions of high tensile residual stresses, the magnitude of which was computed numerically and measured experimentally using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. specifically, these failures could be rationalized due to the superposition of the residual stresses on the farfield applied mean stress, leading to a locally elevated load ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum loads). the effects of residual stress, stress concentration, and microstructurally small cracks are combined in a modified kitagawa– takahashi approach to provide a mechanistic basis for evaluating the detrimental effect of fod on hcf failures in ti– 6al–4v blade alloys. 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
@method intensity-dependent effect of body tilt angle on calf muscle fatigue in humans to explore the effect of posture on muscle performance, we tested the effects of body tilt angle on the strength, endurance, and fatigue of, and blood flow into, the plantar flexors. human subjects were fixed to a tilt table that could tilt them from the horizontal (0 degrees ) to upright (90 degrees ) position and enabled force to be applied to a footplate through isometric action of the right calf muscle. in experiment 1, six subjects performed a strength test and graded test (intermittent contractions) to the point of failure at three tilt angles (0, 47, and 90 degrees ). in experiment 2, seven subjects performed a strength test and constant-force test [70% maximum force (f(max)); intermittent contractions] to the point of failure in the horizontal and three inclined positions (32, 47, and 67 degrees ). in experiment 3, leg blood flow was assessed during constant-force exercise at two intensities (30 and 70% f(max)) and two tilt angles (0 and 67 degrees ) in six subjects. strength was not affected (p > 0.05) by tilt angle. time to failure during the graded test was significantly higher at 47 degrees (25.9 +/- 2.0 min) and 90 degrees (25.1 +/- 3.0 min) than 0 degrees (22.2 +/- 2.6 min). time to failure during the constant-force test was also significantly higher at 32 degrees (7.1 +/- 3.6 min), 47 degrees (8.0 +/- 5.2 min), and 67 degrees (8.6 +/- 5.6 min) compared with 0 degrees (4.0 +/- 2.6 min). when graded or constant-force exercise was performed with arterial flow to the leg eliminated, there were no differences in exercise time between the horizontal and an inclined position. during nonischemic exercise, leg blood flow was significantly higher during exercise in the inclined position. these results demonstrate that head-up tilt improves endurance of the plantar flexors, that this effect occurs in the absence of an effect on strength, and that it depends on an intact peripheral circulation. moreover, the postural effect on muscle endurance appears to be due to a greater blood flow into the leg, an effect that is established during the initial contractions.
@result survey for the presence of ascaridoid larvae in the cinnamon flounder pseudorhombus cinnamoneus (temminck & schlegel) (pleuronectiformes: paralichthyidae). two cases of gastric anisakiasis have been documented in two italian women who had consumed raw anchovies (engraulis encrasicolus). the first patient was a 49-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain and bloody vomiting after ingestion of marinated (vinegar) raw anchovies. during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (egds) a white color worm was detected and extracted from cardia by means of biopsy forceps. the second patient was a 59-year-old woman with irritable bowel syndrome and gastritis, who underwent to periodical egdss. in the course of the last egds, a white color round worm on antrum and a small polyp on the fundus of the stomach were observed. the two nematodes have been identified as l3 larvae of the genus anisakis by a light microscope, and as anisakis pegreffi by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. the molecular identification of the etiological agent at the species level allows to identify what anisakidae species play a zoonotic role and which are the fish host species.
@method activity group localization by modeling the relations among participants in this paper we present a framework for the recognition of collective human activities. a collective activity is defined or reinforced by the existence of coherent behavior of individuals in time and space. we call such coherent behavior ‘crowd context’. examples of collective activities are “queuing in a line” or “talking”. following [7], we propose to recognize collective activities using the crowd context and introduce a new scheme for learning it automatically. our scheme is constructed upon a random forest structure which randomly samples variable volume spatio-temporal regions to pick the most discriminating attributes for classification. unlike previous approaches, our algorithm automatically finds the optimal configuration of spatio-temporal bins, over which to sample the evidence, by randomization. this enables a methodology for modeling crowd context. we employ a 3d markov random field to regularize the classification and localize collective activities in the scene. we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the proposed framework in a number of experiments and show that our method outperforms state-of-the art action classification techniques [7, 19].
@method stable, congestion-controlled application-layer multicasting in pedestrian ad-hoc networks we describe a new scalable application-layer multicast protocol, specifically designed for low-bandwidth, data streaming applications with large receiver sets. our scheme is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the application-layer multicast peers and can support a number of different data delivery trees with desirable properties.we present extensive simulations of both our protocol and the narada application-layer multicast protocol over internet-like topologies. our results show that for groups of size 32 or more, our protocol has lower link stress (by about 25%), improved or similar end-to-end latencies and similar failure recovery properties. more importantly, it is able to achieve these results by using orders of magnitude lower control traffic.finally, we present results from our wide-area testbed in which we experimented with 32-100 member groups distributed over 8 different sites. in our experiments, average group members established and maintained low-latency paths and incurred a maximum packet loss rate of less than 1% as members randomly joined and left the multicast group. the average control overhead during our experiments was less than 1 kbps for groups of size 100.
@method dependency-based long short term memory network for drug-drug interaction extraction syntactic features play an essential role in identifying relationship in a sentence. previous neural network models directly work on raw word sequences or constituent parse trees, thus often suffer from irrelevant information introduced when subjects and objects are in a long distance. in this paper, we propose to learn more robust relation representations from shortest dependency paths through a convolution neural network. we further take the relation directionality into account and propose a straightforward negative sampling strategy to improve the assignment of subjects and objects. experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart approaches on the semeval-2010 task 8 dataset.
@background chromosomal microarray analysis of consecutive individuals with autism spectrum disorders using an ultra-high resolution chromosomal microarray optimized for neurodevelopmental disorders copy number variants (cnvs) as detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental delay (dd), intellectual disability (id), and autism spectrum disorder (asd). this study summarizes the results of 3.5 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory 5487 patients with neurodevelopmental conditions were clinically evaluated for rare copy number variants using a 2.8-million probe custom cma optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. we report an overall detection rate of 29.4% in our neurodevelopmental cohort, which rises to nearly 33% when cases with dd/id and/or mca only are considered. the detection rate for the asd cohort is also significant, at 25%. additionally, we find that detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly depending on the primary indications for testing, the age of the individuals tested, and the specialty of the ordering doctor. we also report a significant difference between the detection rate on the ultrahigh resolution optimized array in comparison to the array from which it originated. this increase in detection can significantly contribute to the efficient and effective medical management of neurodevelopmental conditions in the clinic.
@background escape of sgs1 from rad9 inhibition reduces the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dna end resection abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
@method a memory-efficient bit-split parallel string matching using pattern dividing for intrusion detection systems due to the advantages of easy re-configurability and scalability, the memory-based string matching architecture is widely adopted by network intrusion detection systems (nids). in order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful nids system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. in this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement. for total snort string patterns, the new algorithm achieves 29% of memory reduction compared with the traditional aho-corasick algorithm [5]. moreover, since our approach is orthogonal to other memory reduction approaches, we can obtain substantial gain even after applying the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. for example, after applying the bit-split algorithm [9], we can still gain an additional 22% of memory reduction.
@background comparison of electromyography and force as interfaces for prosthetic control. the characteristics of simple pursuit and compensatory manual control systems were measured with, a family of gaussian input signals having power-density spectra that covered a range of bandwidths, center frequencies, and some variety of shapes. the experimental results, presented in the form of graphs, show the nature of the dependence of human operator characteristics upon input-signal characteristics. the superiority of pursuit systems over compensatory systems is clearly demonstrated. simple analytic models that approximate these measured results are derived for both systems. the compensatory model is highly developed and relations among its parameters and those of the input have been obtained. the pursuit model is not so well developed and only approximate relations among its parameters and the input parameters have been found. the measured results and the analytic models together provide a description of manual control systems that should be useful in design of control systems.
@background sexual dysfunction in pre-menopausal diabetic women: clinical, metabolic, psychological, cardiovascular, and neurophysiologic correlates sexual functioning consists of several phases: desire, arousal, plateau, orgasm, and resolution (1). sexual arousal results from a spinal cord reflex. spinal segments are under excitatory and inhibitory control from supramechanisms, i.e. hypothalamus with its excitatory and androgen receptors. the afferent end is the pudendal nerve, and the efferent one is a coordinated somatic (bulbocavernous, including s2, s3 and s4 sacral segments, which result in muscle contraction) and autonomic nervous system (vaginal and clitoral cavernous autonomic nerves, resulting in clitoral, vaginal and labial enlargement).
@background 2,3-butanedione monoxime unmasks ca(2+)-induced nadh formation and inhibits electron transport in rat hearts. the surface fluorescence of the isolated perfused rat heart has been evaluated for the purpose of nad(p)h quantitation. with the use of excitation at 340, 380, 415, and 430 nm with emission detection at 500 +/- 20 nm, the intensities at 340 and 380 nm excitation were found to be linearly related during nad(p)h oxidation/reduction induced by changes in substrate availability. changes in cardiac nad(p)h caused similar changes at 340 and 380 nm excitation, but those at 340 nm were of greater magnitude. isolated cardiac mitochondria exhibited essentially identical optical properties during changes in nad(p)h content induced by changes in substrate availability and by nad(h) oxidation/reduction caused by coupled phosphorylation of adp. the changes in redox status of both isolated mitochondria and the intact perfused heart can be expressed by a 340/380 excitation fluorescence ratio because of these relationships. this value assumed a minimum and maximum value under conditions of complete oxidation and reduction, respectively. use of this ratio in the perfused heart avoids the artifacts caused by cardiac motion and tissue stretch. removal of motion artifacts with an excitation ratio could only be accomplished if the measurements at 340 and 380 nm were estimated at the same point in the cardiac cycle. a method of cardiac waveform reconstruction and signal averaging is described to obtain these data from sequential measurements. with these techniques, the reduction of cardiac nad(p)h can be expressed as a percentage of the range obtained between minimum and maximum reduction. the described technique is of general utility in the assessment of cardiac bioenergetics.
@method a coupled deformable model for tracking myocardial borders from real-time echocardiography using an incompressibility constraint this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
@background identification of evolutionarily conserved, functional noncoding elements in the promoter region of the sodium channel gene scn8a to identify the transcriptional start sites of the neuronal channel scn8a, we carried out 5'-race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) with rna from human and mouse brain. we recovered four mutually exclusive 5'-untranslated exons (exon 1a to exon 1d) that map to a 1.8-kb region of genomic dna located approximately 70 kb upstream of the first coding exon. the same 5'-untranslated exons are expressed in central, peripheral and sympathetic nervous system and in embryonic and adult brain. a 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing these 5' exons demonstrated promoter activity in transfected mn-1 cells. in transgenic mice, transcription of the 4.8-kb promoter was restricted to brain and spinal cord. the 4.8-kb promoter contains eight consensus sp1-binding sites and two inr sites. a potential nrse/re-1 site is located nearby. two active polyadenylation sites identified by 3'-race are conserved in human, mouse, and chicken scn8a. sequence comparison of human and mouse scn8a identified 12 conserved noncoding elements whose effect on transcription was tested in transfected cells.
@background plastid dna variation in highly fragmented populations of microbiota decussata kom. (cupressaceae), an endemic to sikhote alin mountains plants offer excellent models to investigate how gene flow shapes the organization of genetic diversity. their three genomes can have different modes of transmission and will hence experience varying levels of gene flow. we have compiled studies of genetic structure based on chloroplast dna (cpdna), mitochondrial dna (mtdna) and nuclear markers in seed plants. based on a data set of 183 species belonging to 103 genera and 52 families, we show that the precision of estimates of genetic differentiation (gst) used to infer gene flow is mostly constrained by the sampling of populations. mode of inheritance appears to have a major effect on gst. maternally inherited genomes experience considerably more subdivision (median value of 0.67) than paternally or biparentally inherited genomes (∼0.10). gst at cpdna and mtdna markers covary narrowly when both genomes are maternally inherited, whereas gst at paternally and biparentally inherited markers also covary positively but more loosely and gst at maternally inherited markers are largely independent of values based on nuclear markers. a model‐based gross estimate suggests that, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of pollen flow are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow (median of the pollen‐to‐seed migration ratio: 17) and that pollen and seed gene flow vary independently across species. finally, we show that measures of subdivision that take into account the degree of similarity between haplotypes (nst or rst) make better use of the information inherent in haplotype data than standard measures based on allele frequencies only.
@method computational linguistics harnessing the statistical power of neural networks to perform language understanding and symbolic reasoning is difficult, when it requires executing efficient discrete operations against a large knowledge-base. in this work, we introduce a neural symbolic machine, which contains (a) a neural “programmer”, i.e., a sequence-to-sequence model that maps language utterances to programs and utilizes a key-variable memory to handle compositionality (b) a symbolic “computer”, i.e., a lisp interpreter that performs program execution, and helps find good programs by pruning the search space. we apply reinforce to directly optimize the task reward of this structured prediction problem. to train with weak supervision and improve the stability of reinforce, we augment it with an iterative maximum-likelihood training process. nsm outperforms the state-of-the-art on the webquestionssp dataset when trained from question-answer pairs only, without requiring any feature engineering or domain-specific knowledge.
@background aggression, impulsivity, and plasma sex hormone levels in a group of rapists, in relation to their history of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms objective in an attempt to surmount the problem of retrospectively establishing the childhood diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the authors constructed the 61-item wender utah rating scale (wurs) for adults to use to describe their own childhood behavior. in this paper they present their initial data collection and evaluation of the instrument's validity.   method the scale was administered to 81 adult outpatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 100 "normal" adults, and 70 psychiatric adult outpatients with unipolar depression. the authors analyzed data from the 25 items of the scale that showed the greatest difference between the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the normal comparison subjects and the relationship between the wurs and the patients' parents' judgment of childhood activity as measured by the parents' rating scale.   results the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder had significantly higher mean scores on all 25 items than did the two comparison groups. the difference between the mean total scores of the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the normal subjects was also highly significant. a cutoff score of 46 or higher correctly identified 86% of the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 99% of the normal subjects, and 81% of the depressed subjects. correlations obtained between wurs scores and parents' rating scale scores were moderate but impressive. the ability of wurs scores to predict response to methylphenidate replicated the authors' finding regarding the ability of parents' rating scale scores to predict response to pemoline.   conclusions the wurs is sensitive in identifying childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and may be useful in recognizing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in patients with ambiguous adult psychopathology.
@method a mathematical model of neonatal rat atrial monolayers with constitutively active acetylcholine-mediated k+ current 1. voltage clamp studies of the excitatory sodium current, ina, were carried out in rabbit cardiac purkinje fibres using th two‐micro‐electrode technique. previous work has shown the rabbit purkinje fibre to have relatively simple morphology (sommer & johnson, 1968) and electrical structure (colatsky & tsien, 1979a) compared to other cardiac preparations. 2. non‐uniformities in membrane potential were kept small by reducing the size of ina to less than 50 microa/cm2 of total membrane surface area through prepulse inactivation or removal of external sodium, nao. temporal resolution was improved by cooling to 10‐26 degrees c. these adjustments did not greatly alter the measured properties of the sodium channel. 3. under these conditions, sodium currents were recorded satisfying a number of criteria for adequate voltage control. direct measurement of longitudinal non‐uniformity using a second voltage electrode showed only small deviations at the time of peak current. 4. the properties of the sodium channel were examined using conventional protocols. both peak sodium permeability, pna, and steady‐state sodium inactivation, h infinity, showed a sigmoidal dependence on membrane potential. pna rose steeply with small depolarizations, increasing roughly e‐fold per 3.2 mv, and reaching half‐maximal activation at ‐30 +/‐ 2 mv. the h infinity ‐v curve had a midpoint of ‐74.9 +/‐ 2 mv and a reciprocal slope of 4.56 +/‐ 0.13 mv at temperatures of 10‐19.5 degrees c, and showed a dependence on temperature, shifting to more negative potentials with cooling (approximately 3 mv/10 degrees c). recovery of ina from inactivation in double pulse experiments followed a single exponential time course with time constants of 108‐200 msec at 19 degrees c for holding potentials near ‐80 mv. no attempt was made to describe the activation kinetics because of uncertainties about the early time course of the current. 5. these data predict a maximum duration for ina of less than 1‐2 msec and a maximum peak current density of about 500 microa/cm2 under physiological conditions, i.e. 37 degrees c and 150 mm‐nao. this current magnitude is sufficient to discharge the membrane capacitance at rates comparable to those measured experimentally (311 +/‐ 27 v/sec, colatsky & tsien, 1979a). 6. the limitations of the method are discussed. the major problem is the longitudinal cable delay which limits the speed of voltage control. this makes it difficult to separate the activation of ina from the decay of the capacity transient for potentials positive to ‐15 mv. 7. it is concluded that the approach described is valid for measurements of sodium currents in the potential range where action potentials are initiated, making it possible to study cardiac sodium channels in an adult mammalian preparation which is free of enzymatic treatment.
@background fine-grained object recognition in underwater visual data to build a detailed knowledge of the biodiversity, the geographical distribution and the evolution of the alive species is essential for a sustainable development and the preservation of this biodiversity. massive databases of underwater video surveillance have been recently made available for supporting designing algorithms targeting the identification of fishes. however these video datasets are rather poor in terms of video resolution, pretty challenging regarding both the natural phenomena to be considered such as murky water, seaweed moving the water current, etc, and the huge amount of data to be processed. we have designed a processing chain based on background segmentation, selection keypoints with an adaptive scale, description with opponentsift and learning of each species by a binary linear support vector machines classifier.  our algorithm has been evaluated in the context of our participation to the fish task of the lifeclef2014 challenge. compared to the baseline designed by the lifeclef challenge organizers, our approach reaches a better precision but a worse recall. our performances in terms of species recognition (based only on the correctly detected bounding boxes) is comparable to the baseline, but our bounding boxes are often too large and our score is so penalized. our results are thus really encouraging.

@method callous-unemotional traits and antisocial behavior among adolescents: the role of self-serving cognitions this study investigates the relationship between the self-report youth psychopathic traits inventory (ypi) and the clinician-rated psychopathy checklist: youth version (pcl:yv). a representative sample of 92 girls and 70 boys, 12 to 20 years of age (mean age, 17 years), who received services at a clinic for adolescents with substance misuse problems, was studied. moderate correlations (r =.30—.51) were found between conceptually corresponding ypi and pcl:yv factor scores among both boys and girls, whereas correlations between individual subscales of the ypi and items of the pcl:yv were not as consistent. a cross-tabulation of groupings based on the three-factor models of the two instruments largely supported the categorical convergent validity of the ypi, particularly for low and high scorers. although more studies with larger samples are needed, results indicate that the ypi is a cost-effective measure of psychopathic traits in adolescents in research settings.

@background weakly supervised 3d reconstruction with adversarial constraint inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve robust 3d reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture that we call the 3d recurrent reconstruction neural network (3d-r2n2). the network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3d shapes from a large collection of synthetic data [13]. our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3d occupancy grid. unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and (ii) enables the 3d reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional sfm/slam methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).
@background dynamic model selection for prediction under a budget tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. in this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called xgboost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. we propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. more importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. by combining these insights, xgboost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.
@background long-term actuarial survivorship analysis of an interspinous stabilization system the use of survivorship analysis requires an assumption that patients who are lost to follow-up are no more or less likely to be at risk of failure of an operation or a procedure than are patients who are still being followed. this is a major assumption in long-term orthopaedic studies, in which a high percentage of patients are usually lost to follow-up. we compared the survivorship curve for the first 100 tharies replacements done at our institution (which were completed by september 1977), using data that were collected in the standard way up to 1985, through a letter requesting a follow-up visit, with the curve for the same patients that was based on almost complete follow-up data that were gathered by telephone from 1985 on. the similarity of the two curves suggested that the assumptions that are necessary for the validity of survivorship analysis are reasonable, even in the orthopaedic setting, in which many patients are lost to follow-up. the usefulness of the survivorship curve for prediction was also evaluated by comparing the curve based on the first forty-six of the 100 tharies replacements (before 1977) with the curve based on the last fifty-four such operations (from january 1977 to september 1977). the results of these two comparisons suggest that survivorship analysis is a valid technique to use in the long-term evaluation of patients who have had a joint replacement.
@method recurrent plot analysis of leakage current on flashover performance of rime-iced composite insulator due to the widespread use of polymeric insulating materials in radiation environments, there is an increasing demand to evaluate the radiation effects on the surface dielectric characteristics of polymeric insulating materials. this paper presents a recurrence plot approach to analyze the surface discharge of gamma-ray irradiated polymeric insulating materials based on the tracking test described in iec60112. because the resulting comparative tracking index has wide variation, an attempt has been made to evaluate the resistance to tracking more consistently. in this research, for different dosages of gamma-ray irradiation, the discharge currents are detected when the discharge occurs on the sample surface. recurrence plots of the discharge currents are derived. it is found that the resistance to tracking could be projected on a map as a function of the dosage of irradiation. the recurrence plots are sensitive and give visual methods for identification of the dosage of irradiation effects on the resistance to tracking. results obtained show that with the increase of dosage of irradiation, the resistance to tracking of polybutylene terephthalate decreases, but increases for polyethylene terephthalate.
@method explicit conjunctions without compilation: computing hff(pic) in polynomial time heuristic functions based on the delete relaxation compute upper and lower bounds on the optimal delete-relaxation heuristic h+, and are of paramount importance in both optimal and satisficing planning. here we introduce a principled and flexible technique for improving h+, by augmenting delete-relaxed planning tasks with a limited amount of delete information. this is done by introducing special fluents that explicitly represent conjunctions of fluents in the original planning task, rendering h+ the perfect heuristic h* in the limit. previous work has introduced a method in which the growth of the task is potentially exponential in the number of conjunctions introduced. we formulate an alternative technique relying on conditional effects, limiting the growth of the task to be linear in this number. we show that this method still renders h+ the perfect heuristic h* in the limit. we propose techniques to find an informative set of conjunctions to be introduced in different settings, and analyze and extend existing methods for lower-bounding and upperbounding h+ in the presence of conditional effects. we evaluate the resulting heuristic functions empirically on a set of ipc benchmarks, and show that they are sometimes much more informative than standard delete-relaxation heuristics.
@background in vitro fermentation of different fructo-oligosaccharides by bifidobacterium strains for the selection of synbiotic combinations. the effects of dietary short chain fructooligosaccharides (scfos) incorporation on hematology, fish immune status, gut microbiota composition, digestive enzymes activities, and gut morphology, was evaluated in gilthead sea bream (sparus aurata) juveniles reared at 18 °c and 25 °c. for that purpose, fish with 32 g were fed diets including 0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5% scfos during 8 weeks. overall, scfos had only minor effects on gilthead sea bream immune status. lymphocytes decreased in fish fed the 0.1% scfos diet. fish fed the 0.5% scfos diet presented increased nitric oxide (no) production, while total immunoglobulins (ig) dropped in those fish, but only in the ones reared at 25 °c. red blood cells, hemoglobin, bactericidal activity and no were higher at 25 °c, whereas total white blood cells, circulating thrombocytes, monocytes and neutrophils were higher at 18 °c. in fish fed scfos, lymphocytes were higher at 18 °c. total ig were also higher at 18 °c but only in fish fed 0.1% and 0.5% scfos diets. no differences in gut bacterial profiles were detected by pcr-dgge (polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) between dietary treatments. however, group's similarity was higher at 25 °c. digestive enzymes activities were higher at 25 °c but were unaffected by prebiotics incorporation. gut morphology was also unaffected by dietary prebiotic incorporation. overall, gut microbiota composition, digestive enzymes activities and immunity parameters were affected by rearing temperature whereas dietary scfos incorporation had only minor effects on these parameters. in conclusion, at the tested levels scfos does not seem worthy of including it in gilthead sea bream juveniles diets.
@background extreme-scale stochastic particle tracing for uncertain unsteady flow visualization and analysis the objective of this paper is to understand transport behavior in uncertain time-varying flow fields by redefining the finite-time lyapunov exponent (ftle) and lagrangian coherent structure (lcs) as stochastic counterparts of their traditional deterministic definitions. three new concepts are introduced: the distribution of the ftle (d-ftle), the ftle of distributions (ftle-d), and uncertain lcs (u-lcs). the d-ftle is the probability density function of ftle values for every spatiotemporal location, which can be visualized with different statistical measurements. the ftle-d extends the deterministic ftle by measuring the divergence of particle distributions. it gives a statistical overview of how transport behaviors vary in neighborhood locations. the u-lcs, the probabilities of finding lcss over the domain, can be extracted with stochastic ridge finding and density estimation algorithms. we show that our approach produces better results than existing variance-based methods do. our experiments also show that the combination of d-ftle, ftle-d, and u-lcs can help users understand transport behaviors and find separatrices in ensemble simulations of atmospheric processes.
@background neural basis of postural instability identified by vtc and eeg this study investigated the hypothesis that virtual time-to-contact, which specifies the time to reach the functional stability boundary, is a variable controlled in the maintenance of upright posture. three different levels of support surface compliance were used on a force platform (no foam, 5 cm of foam, and 15 cm of foam). the participant’s task was to stand still under each surface support condition both with and without vision. the stability boundary was determined for each set of conditions where the participant was required to lean as far as possible in all directions of the horizontal plane without losing stability. the results showed that the no vision conditions had a significantly larger center of pressure displacement than the vision conditions. no vision and increasing support surface compliance also increased the velocity of the center of pressure trajectory. the distribution of the radial displacement of the center of pressure showed relatively equal frequency over spatial location with no central tendency. the virtual time-to-contact with the stability boundary decreased as platform surface support became more compliant. furthermore, the distribution of virtual time over the effective scaling range was a power law with a larger exponent in the more unstable no vision and increasing surface foam conditions. the findings provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that virtual time-to-contact with stability boundaries is a postural control variable that is regulated rather than the preservation of minimal motion around the center of the stability region as proposed in pendulum models of posture.
@method a social linkage view on the business value of it as interest into the nature and value of electronic data interchange (edi) within organizations continues to grow, it becomes increasingly desirable to establish a tactical linkage between the strategic value of edi and observed operational benefits. this article provides such a tactical linkage by presenting an approach to edi measurement consisting of four facets: volume, diversity, breadth, and depth of a firm's edi initiatives. each of these facets is defined and then described through its application within the contexts of seven case sites, where each case site represents a strategic business unit having a long, successful history of edi use. the article concludes with suggestions for both practice and research.
@background production of clonal planting materials from gracilaria changii and kappaphycus alvarezii through tissue culture and culture of g. changii explants in airlift photobioreactors there have been limited reports on molecular sex markers for macroalgae. we report the use of random amplified polymorphic dna analysis (rapd) to identify molecular sex markers for gracilaria changii (xia et abbott) abbott, zhang et xia. two dna extraction methods were used: a modified ctab and phenol-chloroform combination method and the dneasy plant mini kit. the ctab and phenol-chloroform method gave the best yield of dna in quality and quantity and is suitable for larger-sized specimens like g. changii. sixty-nine rapd primers were screened to search for sex-linked dna markers for g. changii, and only one sex-linked marker (716 bp) was identified using opa 18. rapd was also used to investigate the molecular characteristics of the three life-stages (male, female, tetrasporophyte) of g. changii. seven (opa7, opa18, s14, s61, s64, s75 and s76) out of the 69 primers showed polymorphism and were selected for interpopulation analysis for dna isolated from 23 samples collected from morib and sungai pulai in malaysia. the combination of data produced by the seven primers generated a dendrogram that grouped the specimens into different clades according to their sex and life-stage using the unweighted pair group and arithmetic averages (upgma) method. it showed that rapd was able to differentiate tetrasporophytes, females, and males.
@method simple representation and approximate search of feature vectors for large-scale object recognition stable local feature detection and representation is a fundamental component of many image registration and object recognition algorithms. mikolajczyk and schmid (june 2003) recently evaluated a variety of approaches and identified the sift [d. g. lowe, 1999] algorithm as being the most resistant to common image deformations. this paper examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor used by sift. like sift, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the image gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead of using sift's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply principal components analysis (pca) to the normalized gradient patch. our experiments demonstrate that the pca-based local descriptors are more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more compact than the standard sift representation. we also present results showing that using these descriptors in an image retrieval application results in increased accuracy and faster matching.
@background critical analysis of consecutive unilateral cleft lip repairs: determining ideal sample size the outcomes of a consecutive series of 10 adults who had unilateral cleft lip and palate and who had undergone le fort i advancement fixed with miniplates were investigated. the amount and timing of horizontal and vertical relapse, the correlation between advancement and relapse, and the effectiveness of various methods of internal fixation were analyzed with respect to the authors' clinical experience and the data from the international literature. tracings of the preoperative and serial postoperative lateral cephalograms--taken immediately and during the 1 1/2 to 2 postoperative years--were analyzed to calculate horizontal and vertical maxillary change. we found that the use of rigid fixation is associated with a significantly more stable postoperative result, as described by other authors. our study suggests that this useful technique does not eliminate but reduces and controls the problem of relapse in a series of unilateral cleft lip and palate adult patients undergoing le fort i osteotomy.
@background modeling redundancy-based routing in delay tolerant networks intermittently connected mobile networks are wireless networks where most of the time there does not exist a complete path from the source to the destination. there are many real networks that fall into this paradigm, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, inter-planetary networks, etc. in this context, conventional routing schemes would fail. to deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. while floodingbased schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. with this in mind, we introduce a new routing scheme, called spray and wait, that “sprays” a number of copies into the network, and then “waits” till one of these nodes meets the destination. we compare this scheme to a number of different routing algorithms including an oracle-based optimal algorithm that minimizes average message delivery delay while using the lowest possible number of transmissions. theory and simulations show that spray and wait has a number of desirable properties: it is very simple to implement, it is highly scalable, it performs close to the optimal scheme, and quite surprisingly, it outperforms all existing schemes with respect to both average message delivery delay and number of transmissions per message delivered.
@background mri findings reveal three different types of tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex background patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and drug-resistant epilepsy may be considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. this demands the unambiguous demonstration of the epileptogenicity of one of the tubers.   objective to test whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables differentiation of epileptogenic tubers from inert ones.   methods in 4 patients with clear unifocal interictal spike activity, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were performed. apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated in the identified epileptogenic tuber and compared withthose in nonepileptogenic tubers and regions of normal-appearing cortex.   results a significant increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient was found in the epileptogenic tubers. furthermore, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nonepileptogenic tubers was significantly higher than the trace apparent diffusion coefficient of regions of normal-appearing cortex.   conclusion diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be of clinical importance for the identification of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis and intractable epilepsy.
@background a modified partial product generator for redundant binary multipliers an algorithm to convert redundant number representations into conventional representations is presented. the algorithm is performed concurrently with the digit-by-digit generation of redundant forms by schemes such as srt division. it has a step delay roughly equivalent to the delay of a carry-save adder and simple implementation. the conversion scheme is applicable in arithmetic algorithms such as nonrestoring division, square root, and on-line operations in which redundantly represented results are generated in a digit-by-digit manner, from most significant to least significant.
@method adversarial personalized ranking for recommendation we present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. we describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. we give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. we experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
@method distributed dynamic pricing with alternating decision making of market players distributed optimal power flow (opf) is a challenging non-linear, non-convex problem of central importance to the future power grid. although many approaches are currently available in the literature, these require some form of central coordination to properly work. in this paper a fully distributed and robust algorithm for opf is proposed which does not require any form of central coordination. the algorithm is based upon the alternating direction multiplier method (admm) in a form recently proposed by the author, which, in turn, builds upon the work of schizas the approach is customized as a region-based optimization procedure, and it is tested in meaningful scenarios.
@background evidence for source–sink dynamics in a regional population of arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii plesius) nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
@result qt dispersion in amyloidosis due to familial mediterranean fever the aim of the study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial mediterranean fever (fmf). findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared with 32 patients with uncomplicated fmf and age- and sex-matched control subjects. all procedures followed stringent standards. repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the five beats were subsequently averaged. there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in average qt and average corrected qt interval length, average qt interval dispersion, average qt corrected dispersion, or qt dispersion ratio. during 6 months of follow-up, no cases of sudden death or arrhythmia were documented in either group. patients with fmf who are continuously treated with low-dose colchicine and have not developed amyloidosis seem to have qt dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects and therefore apparently have no increased risk of adverse cardiac events associated with abnormal repolarization.
@background genetic analysis of two japanese patients with non-classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency. we determined the sequence of a mutant cyp21b gene isolated from a patient with the severe, "salt-wasting" form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. codon 318 in this gene is changed from cag, encoding glutamine, to tag, a nonsense codon. this is predicted to result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme due to premature termination of translation. in addition, when the cloned mutant gene was transfected into mouse y1 adrenal cells, the resulting mrna levels were decreased compared with transfected normal cyp21b genes. this mutation was carried by 3 of 20 unrelated patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles as determined by hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide probe. this mutation is also seen in the normal cyp21a pseudogene, so that its presence in the abnormal cyp21b gene may be the result of a gene conversion event.
@method a comparative analysis of social sciences citation tools the web of science is no longer the only database which offers citation indexing of the social sciences. scopus, csa illumina and google scholar are new entrants in this market. the holdings and citation records of these four databases were assessed against two sets of data one drawn from the 2001 research assessment exercise and the other from the international bibliography of the social sciences. initially, csa illumina's coverage at journal title level appeared to be the most comprehensive. but when recall and average citation count was tested at article level and rankings extrapolated by submission frequency to individual journal titles, scopus was ranked first. when issues of functionality, the quality of record processing and depth of coverage are taken into account, scopus and web of science have a significant advantage over the other two databases. from this analysis, scopus offers the best coverage from amongst these databases and could be used as an alternative to the web of science as a tool to evaluate the research impact in the social sciences.

@background a unified deep artificial neural network approach to partial differential equations in complex geometries we study a new algorithm for solving parabolic partial differential equations (pdes) and backward stochastic differential equations (bsdes) in high dimension, which is based on an analogy between the bsde and reinforcement learning with the gradient of the solution playing the role of the policy function, and the loss function given by the error between the prescribed terminal condition and the solution of the bsde. the policy function is then approximated by a neural network, as is done in deep reinforcement learning. numerical results using tensorflow illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the studied algorithm for several 100-dimensional nonlinear pdes from physics and finance such as the allen–cahn equation, the hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation, and a nonlinear pricing model for financial derivatives.
@background bdnf variants influence educational attainment but not disease characteristics in alzheimers disease a functional polymorphism in the coding region of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene (196 a/g, met66val) has recently been reported to be associated with alzheimer's disease (ad) and with an overrepresentation of g allele in ad patients, but different results have also been presented. we conducted a case-control study to analyze the association between the bdnf a/g polymorphism and sporadic ad in a sample composed of 203 ad patients and 239 controls from mainland chinese han population. no association between the polymorphism and ad, no association between the polymorphism and age at onset in ad, and no significant interaction between bdnf and apolipoprotein e (apoe) genotype were detected in either the total or the male samples. however, a significantly high frequency of the gg genotype in the female controls compared with the female patients was detected. a postponed age at onset in the female patients with the gg genotype was also observed. these results suggest that the gg genotype has a protection effect from ad development in females. a significant low frequency of ad patients with the bdnf gg genotype in the ad apoeepsilon4 carriers compared with the frequency of the controls with the bdnf gg genotype in the control apoeepsilon4 carriers was also detected in the female individuals, suggesting that the bdnf gg genotype may reduce the effect of apoeepsilon4 on ad risk in females. additionally, low frequencies of bdnf g allele and gg genotype were revealed in chinese when compared with that in the other race populations so far reported.
@background polyanalgesic consensus conference—2012: recommendations to reduce morbidity and mortality in intrathecal drug delivery in the treatment of chronic pain objectives:the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal narcotics pump (itnp) as an alternative treatment for patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis (cp). itnp offers the advantages of reversibility, lower total narcotic dose, and the pancreas remaining intact.methods:thirteen patients (8 female, 5 male), with mean age 40.6 years (s.d. 9.6 years), who had experienced intractable upper abdominal pain from cp were reviewed. each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). they were offered itnp after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. etiologies of cp included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).results:the median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to itnp was 6 years (2–22 years). the median follow-up time after itnp was 29 months (range, 7–94 months). the itnp was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5–94 months). seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). there were no deaths. the mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (p<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (p<0.01). the median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after itnp were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5 mg per day (range, 67.5–1,320) and 40 mg per day (range, 0–1,680), respectively (p<0.01). two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. one patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. therefore, the overall success rate of itnp based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). the major complications of itnp were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).conclusions:this study shows the many risks and benefits of itnp. a longer follow-up is awaited; such pumps appear to be one alternative to aggressive surgical intervention. failed itnp trials leave other options open. therapeutic trials directly comparing pancreatectomy, itnp, and implanted nerve stimulators are of interest.
@background sex‐specific activation of sk current by isoproterenol facilitates action potential triangulation and arrhythmogenesis in rabbit ventricles a mathematical model of a small conductance ca2+‐activated potassium (sk) channel was developed and incorporated into a physiologically detailed ventricular myocyte model. ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents promote negative intracellular ca2+ to membrane voltage (cai2+→ vm) coupling. increase of ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents can be responsible for electromechanically discordant alternans and quasiperiodic oscillations at the cellular level. at the tissue level, turing‐type instability can occur when ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents are increased.
@background evaluation of trunk muscle activity in chronic low back pain patients and healthy individuals during holding loads. stability of the lumbar spine is an important factor in determining spinal response to sudden loading. using two different methods, this study evaluated how various trunk load magnitudes and directions affect lumbar spine stability. the first method was a quick release procedure in which effective trunk stiffness and stability were calculated from trunk kinematic response to a resisted-force release. the second method combined trunk muscle emg data with a biomechanical model to calculate lumbar spine stability. twelve subjects were tested in trunk flexion, extension, and lateral bending under nine permutations of vertical and horizontal trunk loading. the vertical load values were set at 0, 20, and 40% of the subject's body weight (bw). the horizontal loads were 0, 10, and 20% of bw. effective spine stability as obtained from quick release experimentation increased significantly (p<0.01) with increased vertical and horizontal loading. it ranged from 785 (s.d.=580) nm/rad under no-load conditions to 2200 (s.d.=1015) nm/rad when the maximum horizontal and vertical loads were applied to the trunk simultaneously. stability of the lumbar spine achieved prior to force release and estimated from the biomechanical model explained approximately 50% of variance in the effective spine stability obtained from quick release trials in extension and lateral bending (0.53<r(2)<0.63). there was no such correlation in flexion trials. it was concluded that lumbar spine stability increased with increased trunk load magnitude to the extent that this load brought about an increase in trunk muscle activation. indirectly, our data suggest that muscle reflex response to sudden loading can augment the lumbar spine stability level achieved immediately prior to the sudden loading event.
@background human disturbance reduces genetic diversity of an endangered tropical tree, prunus africana (rosaceae) i reexamine the use of isolation by distance models as a basis for the estimation of demographic parameters from measures of population subdivision. to that aim, i first provide results for values of f-statistics in one-dimensional models and coalescence times in two-dimensional models, and make more precise earlier results for f-statistics in two-dimensional models and coalescence times in one-dimensional models. based on these results, i propose a method of data analysis involving the regression of fst/(1-fst) estimates for pairs of subpopulations on geographic distance for populations along linear habitats or logarithm of distance for populations in two-dimensional habitats. this regression provides in principle an estimate of the product of population density and second moment of parental axial distance. in two cases where comparison to direct estimates is possible, the method proposed here is more satisfactory than previous indirect methods.
@background polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (ptb) and ptb-associated splicing factor in cvb3 infection: an itaf for an itaf poliovirus protease 2a (2apro) obstructs host gene expression by reprogramming transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory events during infection. here we demonstrate that expression of 2apro induces a selective nucleo-cytoplasm translocation of several important rna binding proteins and splicing factors. subcellular fractionation studies, together with immunofluorescence microscopy revealed an asymmetric distribution of hur and tia1/tiar in 2apro expressing cells, which modulates splicing of the human fas exon 6. consistent with this result, knockdown of hur or overexpression of tia1/tiar, leads to fas exon 6 inclusion in 2apro-expressing cells. therefore, poliovirus 2apro can target alternative pre-mrna splicing by regulating protein shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
@background evaluation of biotechnology-derived novel proteins for the risk of food-allergic potential: advances in the development of animal models and future challenges discredited a few years ago, active suppression is now commonly considered as a key mechanism avoiding auto-reactivity and development of potentially harmful immune responses, and in some circumstances, as an obstacle to successful vaccination. a large quantity of literature identifies naturally occurring cd4+cd25+ t cells as key suppressor cells involved in the control of many pathophysiological diseases. manipulation of these cells and control of their function offers new perspectives for the treatment of auto-immune and inflammatory diseases and enhancement of vaccine efficacy. such clinical interventions require a better understanding of the conditions of expansion/activation of cd4+cd25+ t cells and deciphering of their mechanism of suppression, which remains incomplete and sometimes controversial.
@method caprg: sequence assembling pipeline for next generation sequencing of non-model organisms we have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called "velvet," to manipulate de bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. a de bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. applying velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb n50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb n50 on simulated mammalian bacs. when applied to real solexa data sets without read pairs, velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian bac, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.
@background training skills of divided attention among older adults the authors examined the effects of divided attention (da) at encoding and retrieval in free recall, cued recall, and recognition memory in 4 experiments. lists of words or word pairs were presented auditorily and recalled orally; the secondary task was a visual continuous reaction-time (rt) task with manual responses. at encoding, da was associated with large reductions in memory performance, but small increases in rt; trade-offs between memory and rt were under conscious control. in contrast, da at retrieval resulted in small or no reductions in memory, but in comparatively larger increases in rt, especially in free recall. memory performance was sensitive to changes in task emphasis at encoding but not at retrieval. the results are discussed in terms of controlled and automatic processes and speculatively linked to underlying neuropsychological mechanisms.
@method effects of blackcurrant anthocyanin intake on peripheral muscle circulation during typing work in humans abstract we have investigated the etiology of lower-back muscle fatigue using simultaneous recordings of electromyography (emg), mechanomyography (mmg), and near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) in an attempt to shed some light on the electrophysiological, mechanical, and metabolic characteristics, respectively. eight male subjects performed isometric back extensions at an angle of 15° with reference to the horizontal plane, for a period of 60 s. surface emg, mmg and nirs signals were recorded simultaneously from the center of the erector spinae at the level of l3. nirs was measured to determine the level of muscle blood volume (bv) and oxygenation (oxy-hb). the root mean square amplitude value (rms) of the emg signal was significantly increased at the initial phase of contraction and then fell significantly, while mean power frequency (mpf) of the emg signal decreased significantly and progressively as a function of time. there were also significant initial increases in rms-mmg that were followed by progressive decreases at the end of fatiguing contractions. mpf-mmg remained unchanged. muscle bv and oxy-hb decreased dramatically at the onset of the contraction and then remained almost constant throughout the rest of the contraction. these results, obtained by simultaneous recordings of emg, mmg, and nirs, demonstrate that the restriction of blood flow due to high intramuscular mechanical pressure is one of the most important factors in muscle fatigue in the lower-back muscles. in addition, the simultaneous recording system described here can be used to obtain more reliable information regarding the mechanism(s) of lower-back muscle fatigue.
@background neural correlates of gentle skin stroking in early infancy the multimodal properties of the human somatosensory system continue to be unravelled. there is mounting evidence that one of these submodalities-touch-has another dimension, providing not only its well-recognized discriminative input to the brain, but also an affective input. it has long been recognized that touch plays an important role in many forms of social communication and a number of theories have been proposed to explain observations and beliefs about the "power of touch." here, we propose that a class of low-threshold mechanosensitive c fibers that innervate the hairy skin represent the neurobiological substrate for the affective and rewarding properties of touch.
@background prediction and rate of infections in diabetes mellitus patients with diabetes ketoacidosis in penang, malaysia diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (tidm). mortality is predominantly related to the occurrence of cerebral oedema; only a minority of deaths in dka are attributed to other causes. cerebral oedema occurs in about 0.3–1% of all episodes of dka, and its aetiology, pathophysiology, and ideal method of treatment are poorly understood. there is debate as to whether physicians treating dka can prevent or predict the occurrence of cerebral oedema, and the appropriate site(s) for children with dka to be managed. there is agreement that prevention of dka and reduction of its incidence should be a goal in managing children with diabetes.
@method updating target distance across eye movements in depth. an experiment investigated in human adults the sensorimotor transformation involved in pointing to a spatial target identified previously by kinesthetic cues. in the “locating phase,” a computer-controlled mechanical arm guided the left [condition lr (left–right)] or right [condition rr (right–right)] finger of the blindfolded participant to one of 27 target positions. in the subsequent “pointing phase,” the participant tried to reach the same position with the right finger. the final finger position and the posture of the arm were measured in both conditions. constant errors were large but consistent and remarkably similar across conditions, suggesting that, whatever the locating hand, target position is coded in an extrinsic frame of reference (target position hypothesis). the main difference between the same-hand (rr) and different-hand (lr) conditions was a symmetric shift of the pattern of endpoints with respect to the midsagittal plane. this effect was modeled accurately by assuming a systematic bias in the perception of the postural angles of the locating arm. the analysis of the variable errors indicated that target position is represented internally in a spherical coordinate system centered on the shoulder of the pointing arm and that the main source of variability is within the planning stage of the pointing movement. locating and pointing postures depended systematically on target position. we tested qualitatively the hypothesis that the selection of both postures (inverse kinematic problem) is constrained by a minimum-distance principle. in condition rr, pointing posture depended also on the locating posture, implying the presence of a memory trace of the previous movement. a scheme is suggested to accommodate the results within an extended version of the target position hypothesis.
@background on the development of kinetic models for solvent-free benzyl alcohol oxidation over a gold-palladium catalyst in the solvent free oxidation of benzyl alcohol, using supported gold-palladium nanoalloys, toluene is often one of major by-products and it is formed by the disproportionation of benzyl alcohol. gold-palladium catalysts on acidic supports promote both the disproportionation of benzyl alcohol and oxidative dehydrogenation to form benzaldehyde. basic supports completely switch off disproportionation and the gold-palladium nanoparticles catalyse the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction exclusively. in an attempt to provide further details on the course of these reactions, we have utilized in situ atr-ir, in situ drift and inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopic methods, and in this article we present the results of these in situ spectroscopic studies.
@background effect of retro and forward walking on quadriceps muscle strength, pain, function, and mobility in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial background: increased external knee adduction moment during walking alters the joint biomechanics; which causes symptoms in chronic knee osteoarthritis patients. aims: to assess additional effects of retro-walking over conventional treatment on pain and disability in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic knee osteoarthritis. materials and methods: thirty chronic knee osteoarthritis patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. group ‘a’ (7 men, 8 women) received conventional treatment. group ‘b’ (8 men, 7 women) received conventional treatment and retro-walking. pain, assessed through visual analogue scale (vas), and western ontario and mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) were the primary outcomes and knee range of motion (rom), hip abductor and extensor strength were secondary outcomes; measured pre-intervention, after 1 week and after 3 weeks of intervention. results: two factors analysis of variance for repeated measures was used for all outcomes. at the end of 3 weeks; womac score showed highly significant difference within (p < 0.0001) and significant difference between groups (p = 0.040) also by time × group interaction (p = 0.024), vas showed highly significant difference within groups (p < 0.0001). knee rom showed significant difference within groups. hip abductor and extensor strength showed significant difference by time × group interaction (p < 0.05). conclusion: retrowalking is an effective adjunct to conventional treatment in decreasing disability in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
@method clinical applications of marsala for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy. preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is well established method for treatment of genetic problems associated with infertility. moreover, pgd with next-generation sequencing (ngs) provide new possibilities for diagnosis and new parameters for evaluation in, for example, aneuploidy screening. the aim of the study was to report the successful pregnancy outcome following pgd with ngs as the method for 24 chromosome aneuploidy screening in the case of robertsonian translocation. day 3 embryos screening for chromosomal aneuploidy was performed in two consecutive in vitro fertilization (ivf) cycles, first with fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), and then with ngs-based protocol. in each ivf attempt, three embryos were biopsied. short duration of procedures enabled fresh embryo transfer without the need for vitrification. first ivf cycle with the embryo selected using pgd analysis with the fish method ended with pregnancy loss in week 8. the second attempt with ngs-based aneuploidy screening led to exclusion of the following two embryos: one embryo with 22 monosomy and one with multiple aneuploidies. the transfer of the only euploid blastocyst resulted in the successful pregnancy outcome. the identification of the euploid embryo based on the ngs application was the first successful clinical application of ngs-based pgd in the case of the robertsonian translocation carrier couple.
@method the influence of incline and speed on work rate, gross efficiency and kinematics of roller ski skating objective to examine the effect of an increase in roller ski rolling resistance on the physiological and upper body demands of roller skiing with the v2-alternate technique.   methods nine highly skilled cross-country skiers roller skied at three paced speeds on a flat oval loop using roller skis with high (hir) and low (lowr) rolling resistance. oxygen uptake (vo2), heart rate, and poling forces were measured during the last 30 s and rating of perceived exertion (rpe) was requested immediately after each 4-min bout of roller skiing.   results vo2 and all force-related variables increased significantly with speed and were higher (p < 0.01) for hir at given speeds. poling time was similar between hir and lowr, whereas poling recovery time was shorter (p = 0.0002) and cycle rate was higher (p = 0.002) for hir. for given vo2 levels, peak and average forces, heart rates, and rpe values were similar between hir and lowr, whereas average poling force across the cycle was greater (p = 0.006) and duty cycle (i.e., percentage of cycle when poling forces were applied) was higher (p = 0.0001) with hir.   conclusions 1) the decrease in poling recovery time and increase in cycle rate associated with an increase in roller ski rolling resistance is comparable to the effect previously observed from increasing grade and probably occurs as a means of limiting deceleration. 2) since changes in rolling resistance do not alter the relationships of rpe and heart rate with vo2, the central cardiovascular adaptations from roller ski training should not be affected by the rolling resistance of the roller skis. 3) higher resistance roller skis are likely to induce greater upper body aerobic adaptations than lower resistance roller skis.
@background recent duplication and inter-locus gene conversion in major histocompatibility class ii genes in a teleost, the three-spined stickleback we have tested the importance of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class iib in atlantic salmon (salmo salar) for survival after challenge with a highly virulent bacterial pathogen. forty juvenile full siblings from each of 120 families were infected with the bacterium aeromonas salmonicida, which causes high mortality in salmon due to furunculosis. fishes from high–resistance (hr, < 35% mortality) and low–resistance (lr, > 80% mortality) families were screened for their mhc class iib genotypes using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) technique. the exon 2 sequences, encoding the major part of the peptide–binding region, were established for each dgge fragment. one allele, e, containing a missense single base substitution was significantly more prevalent in hr families than in lr families. an odds–ratio test showed that broods carrying this allele had a 12–fold higher chance of being hr than broods without the e allele. a second allele, i, showed significantly higher frequencies in uninfected and surviving individuals than in infected dead individuals. a third allele, j, tended to be more prevalent both in lr families and in individuals that had died of the infection. there was no correlation between mhc heterozygosity and resistance to a. salmonicida. our results support the hypothesis that mhc polymorphism is maintained through pathogen–driven selection acting by means of frequency–dependent selection rather than heterozygous advantage.
@method actionness ranking with lattice conditional ordinal random fields detecting humans in films and videos is a challenging problem owing to the motion of the subjects, the camera and the background and to variations in pose, appearance, clothing, illumination and background clutter. we develop a detector for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds, testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. these motion-based descriptors are combined with our histogram of oriented gradient appearance descriptors. the resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. we validate our results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. the combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000 windows tested at 8% miss rate on our test set 1.
@method role of the skp1 prolyl-hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in oxygen dependent submerged development of dictyostelium o(2) regulates multicellular development of the social amoeba dictyostelium, suggesting it may serve as an important cue in its native soil environment. dictyostelium expresses an hifα-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p4h1) whose levels affect the o(2)-threshold for culmination implicating it as a direct o(2)-sensor, as in animals. but dictyostelium lacks hifα, a mediator of animal prolyl 4-hydroxylase signaling, and p4h1 can hydroxylate pro143 of skp1, a subunit of e3(scf)ubiquitin-ligases. skp1 hydroxyproline then becomes the target of five sequential glycosyltransferase reactions that modulate the o(2)-signal. here we show that genetically induced changes in skp1 levels also affect the o(2)-threshold, in opposite direction to that of the modification enzymes suggesting that the latter reduce skp1 activity. consistent with this, overexpressed skp1 is poorly hydroxylated and skp1 is the only p4h1 substrate detectable in extracts. effects of pro143 mutations, and of combinations of skp1 and enzyme level perturbations, are consistent with pathway modulation of skp1 activity. however, some effects were not mirrored by changes in modification of the bulk skp1 pool, implicating a skp1 subpopulation and possibly additional unknown factors. altered skp1 levels also affected other developmental transitions in a modification-dependent fashion. whereas hydroxylation of animal hifα results in its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, dictyostelium skp1 levels were little affected by its modification status. these data indicate that skp1 and possibly e3(scf)ubiquitin-ligase activity modulate o(2)-dependent culmination and other developmental processes, and at least partially mediate the action of the hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in o(2)-sensing.
@background efficiency of transcriptional gene silencing of gbssi in potato depends on the promoter region that is used in an inverted repeat two distinct gene-silencing phenomena are observed in plants: transcriptional gene silencing (tgs), which involves decreased rna synthesis because of promoter methylation, and posttranscriptional gene silencing (ptgs), which involves sequence-specific rna degradation. ptgs is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (r.v.b., unpublished data) of double-stranded rna (dsrna). tgs could be the result of dna pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsrna, as was shown by the dsrna-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in petunia, transgenes expressing dsrna can induce ptgs when coding sequences are used and tgs when promoter sequences are taken. for both types of silencing, small rna species are found, which are thought to be dsrna decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of dna sequences that are homologous to dsrna. dna methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating tgs and important for reinforcing ptgs [10]. therefore, we conclude that tgs and ptgs are mechanistically related. in addition, we show that dsrna-induced tgs provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the tgs of a ptgs-inducing transgene fully revert the ptgs phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsrna corresponding to its promoter.
@method skeletal facial balance and harmony in the cleft patient: principles and techniques in orthognathic surgery craniofacial osteotomies have by convention been bilamellar translocations of the entire substance of the dysmorphic bone. this approach limits the surgeon by reducing the stable bone mass available for fixation, creating dependence on concave surfaces. most important, it changes the bony topography that determines the preoperative plan. this paper presents a new craniofacial concept and technique used in 26 patients with various dysmorphic syndromes who were reconstructed by performing a lamellar split osteotomy. this technique maintains the internal lamella in its native position, thereby allowing it to act as a reference for the bony topography and providing a stable facial framework for rigid fixation. this interlamellar osteotomy has led to improved aesthetic results in the orthomorphic reconstructions of congenital and other deformities. it can be used in any aesthetic patient in whom contour changes or augmentation of form is desired. it is recommended as a preferred method for achieving quantitative contour improvement in patients over 3 years of age.
@method antigenic and genetic characterization of a divergent african virus, ikoma lyssavirus abstract all lyssaviruses cause fatal encephalitis in mammals. there is sufficient antigenic variation within the genus to cause variable vaccine efficacy, but this variation is difficult to characterize quantitatively: sequence analysis cannot yet provide detailed antigenic information, and antigenic neutralization data have been refractory to high-resolution robust interpretation. here, we address these issues by using state-of-the-art antigenic analyses to generate a high-resolution antigenic map of a global panel of 25 lyssaviruses. we compared the calculated antigenic distances with viral glycoprotein ectodomain sequence data. although 67% of antigenic variation was predictable from the glycoprotein amino acid sequence, there are in some cases substantial differences between genetic and antigenic distances, thus highlighting the risk of inferring antigenic relationships solely from sequence data at this time. these differences included epidemiologically important antigenic differences between vaccine strains and wild-type rabies viruses. further, we quantitatively assessed the antigenic relationships measured by using rabbit, mouse, and human sera, validating the use of nonhuman experimental animals as a model for determining antigenic variation in humans. the use of passive immune globulin is a crucial component of rabies postexposure prophylaxis, and here we also show that it is possible to predict the reactivity of immune globulin against divergent lyssaviruses.
@background retrograde dynamic locked nailing for valgus knee correction: a revised technique twenty-one patients with lateral compartment osteoarthritis and valgus deformity of the knee underwent distal femoral supracondylar osteotomy (medial closing wedge) between 1983 and 1993 with follow-up ranging from 1 to 8 years. ten knees had plaster cast immobilization, 5 had fixation with 2 staples supplemented with a plaster cast, and 6 knees had rigid internal fixation with an ao blade plate. thirty-three percent of patients had a satisfactory result using the hss score, and 57% had a satisfactory result using the knee society clinical rating. fifty-seven percent had a significant complication, including severe knee stiffness requiring manipulation under anesthesia (48%), nonunion/delayed union (19%), infection (10%), and fixation failure (5%). five (19%) knees required total knee replacement within 5 years of surgery. satisfactory results were obtained only in those patients who had less severe degrees of osteoarthritis confined to the lateral compartment (grades i to iii), adequate correction of valgus deformity (the anatomical axis within 2 degrees from zero), and rigid internal fixation to permit postoperative early mobilization. these results indicate that distal femoral osteotomy is a satisfactory procedure in the young, active patient with osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment of the knee, but requires precise surgical technique and rigid internal fixation.
@background epidemiology and socioeconomic impact of seasonal affective disorder in austria. backgroundan interview format version of the sheehan disability scale (sds) modified to assess gambling treatment outcomes was assessed for reliability and validity. the sds assesses impairment in work, family and social functioning related to mental disorders.methodsa pilot study (n = 21) determined the preferred wording for oral administration. participants with pathological gambling in a relapse prevention clinical trial completed the scale and other validation measures at baseline, six and twelve month follow-ups (n = 169).resultsconfirmatory factor analysis supported a one factor solution and the scale had good internal reliability for a three item scale. the sds was sensitive to change and correlations with recent gambling behaviour and severity were moderate as expected. similarly, correlations with self-efficacy, perceived control over gambling, and craving were moderate, but they were lower for less directly related constructs such as depression and perceived family and friend support.conclusionsthe sds is a brief, psychometrically sound, outcome measure of impairment associated with gambling disorders that can be administered by telephone.
@background tlr4-mediated expression of mac-1 in monocytes plays a pivotal role in monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium platelets are essential for primary hemostasis, but they also play an important pro-inflammatory role. platelets normally circulate in a quiescent state. upon activation, platelets can secrete and present various molecules, change their shape as well as the expression pattern of adhesion molecules. these changes are associated with the adhesion of platelets to leukocytes and the vessel wall. the interaction of platelets with neutrophils promotes the recruitment of neutrophils into inflammatory tissue and thus participates in host defense. this interaction of neutrophils with platelets is mainly mediated through p-selectin and beta(2) and beta(3) integrins (cd11b/cd18, cd41/cd61). platelets can also interact with endothelial cells and monocytes. adherent platelets promote the 'secondary capture' of neutrophils and other leukocytes. in addition, platelets secrete neutrophil and endothelial activators inducing production of inflammatory cytokines. thus, platelets are important amplifiers of acute inflammation.
@background smt3/sumo and ubc9 are required for efficient apc/c‐mediated proteolysis in budding yeast cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is controlled by the p34cdc21cdc28 protein kinase and its short-lived, phase-specific regulatory subunits called cyclins1,2. in xenopus oocytes, degradation of m-phase (b-type) cyclins is required for exit from mitosis and is mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system3. here we show that b-type-cyclin degradation in yeast involves an essential nuclear ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubc9. repression of ubc9 synthesis prevents cell cycle progression at the g2 or early m phase, causing the accumulation of large budded cells with a single nucleus, a short spindle and replicated dna. in ubc9 mutants both clb5, an s-phase cyclin4,5, and clb2, an m-phase cyclin6,7, are stabilized. in wild-type cells the clb5 protein is unstable throughout the cell cycle, whereas clb2 turnover occurs only at a specific cell-cycle stage8. thus distinct degradation signals or regulated interaction with the ubiquitin-protein ligase system may determine the cell-cycle specificity of cyclin proteolysi
@method activation of k+ channels induces apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. over recent years, it has become clear that mitochondria play a central role in many key aspects of animal physiology and pathophysiology. their central and ubiquitous task is clearly the production of atp. nevertheless, they also play subtle roles in glucose homeostasis, acting as the sensor for substrate supply in the transduction pathway that promotes insulin secretion by the pancreatic β‐cell and that modulates the excitability of the hypothalamic glucose‐sensitive neurons involved in appetite control. mitochondria may also act as sensors of availability of oxygen, the other major mitochondrial substrate, in the regulation of respiration. mitochondria take up calcium, and the high capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake pathway provides a mechanism that couples energy demand to increased atp production through the calcium‐dependent upregulation of mitochondrial enzyme activity. mitochondrial calcium accumulation may also have a substantial impact on the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular calcium signals, with subtle differences of detail in different cell types. recent work has also revealed the centrality of mitochondrial dysfunction as an irreversible step in the pathway to both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. this review looks at recent developments in these rapidly evolving areas of cell physiology in an attempt to draw together disparate areas of research into a common theme.
@result early postoperative serum cystatin c predicts severe acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial introductionin critically ill patients sudden changes in glomerular filtration rate (gfr) are not instantly followed by parallel changes in serum creatinine. the aim of the present study was to analyze the utility of serum cystatin c as a marker of renal function in these patients.methodsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and 24-hour creatinine clearance (ccr) were determined in 50 critically ill patients (age 21–86 years; mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score 20 ± 9). they did not have chronic renal failure but were at risk for developing renal dysfunction. serum cystatin c was measured using particle enhanced immunonephelometry. twenty-four-hour body surface adjusted ccr was used as a control because it is the 'gold standard' for determining gfr.resultsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and ccr (mean ± standard deviation [range]) were 1.00 ± 0.85 mg/dl (0.40–5.61 mg/dl), 1.19 ± 0.79 mg/l (0.49–4.70 mg/l), and 92.74 ± 52.74 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (8.17–233.21 ml/min per 1.73 m2), respectively. our data showed that serum cystatin c correlated better with gfr than did creatinine (1/cystatin c versus ccr: r = 0.832, p < 0.001; 1/creatinine versus ccr: r = 0.426, p = 0.002). cystatin c was diagnostically superior to creatinine (area under the curve [auc] for cystatin c 0.927, 95% confidence interval 86.1–99.4; auc for creatinine 0.694, 95% confidence interval 54.1–84.6). half of the patients had acute renal dysfunction. only five (20%) of these 25 patients had elevated serum creatinine, whereas 76% had elevated serum cystatin c levels (p = 0.032).conclusioncystatin c is an accurate marker of subtle changes in gfr, and it may be superior to creatinine when assessing this parameter in clinical practice in critically ill patients.
@method complementary populations of human adipose cd34+ progenitor cells promote growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis of breast cancer. previous studies have suggested a "catalytic role" in neoplastic angiogenesis and cancer progression for bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (epc). however, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the quantitative role of marrow-derived epcs in cancer vascularization is extremely variable. we have found that human and murine white adipose tissue (wat) is a very rich reservoir of cd45-cd34(+) epcs with endothelial differentiation potential, containing a mean of 263 times more cd45-cd34(+) cells/ml than bone marrow. compared with marrow-derived cd34(+) cells mobilized in blood by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, purified wat-cd34(+) cells expressed similar levels of stemness-related genes, significantly increased levels of angiogenesis-related genes, and increased levels of fap-α, a crucial suppressor of antitumor immunity. in vitro, wat-cd34(+) cells generated mature endothelial cells and capillary tubes as efficiently as mature mesenchymal cells. the coinjection of human wat-cd34(+) cells from lipotransfer procedures contributed to tumor vascularization and significantly increased tumor growth and metastases in several orthotopic models of human breast cancer in immunodeficient mice. endothelial cells derived from human wat-cd34(+) cells lined the lumen of cancer vessels. these data indicate that cd34(+) wat cells can promote cancer progression and metastases. our results highlight the importance of gaining a better understanding of the role of different wat-derived cells used in lipotransfer for breast reconstruction in patients with breast cancer.
@background quantitative characterization of functional anatomical contributions to cognitive control under uncertainty tasks involving conflict between stimulus dimensions have been shown to activate dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas. it has been proposed that the dorsal anterior cingulate is involved a domain general process of monitoring conflict, while prefrontal areas are involved in resolving conflict. we examine three tasks that all require people to respond based on one stimulus dimension while ignoring another conflicting dimension, but which vary in the source of conflict. one of the tasks uses language stimuli (stroop effect) and two use nonlanguage spatial conflicts appropriate for children and nonhuman animals. in experiment 1, 12 participants were studied with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while performing each of the three tasks. reaction times for each of the three tasks were significantly longer in the incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition, demonstrating that each task elicits a conflict. by studying the same people in the same session, we test the hypothesis that conflict activates a similar brain network in the three tasks. significant activations were found in the anterior cingulate and left prefrontal cortex for all three conflict tasks. within these regions, the conflict component demonstrated evidence for significant common activation across the three tasks, although the peak activation point and spatial extent were not identical. other areas demonstrated activation unique to each task. experiments 2-4 provide behavioral evidence indicating considerable independence between conflict operations involved in the tasks. the behavioral and fmri results taken together seem to argue against a single unified network for processing conflict, but instead support either distinct networks for each conflict task or a single network that monitors conflict with different sites used to resolve the conflict.
@background boundary ground ring in minimal string theory the correspondence claimed by douglas between the multicritical regimes of the two-matrix model and 2d gravity coupled with (p,q) rational matter field, is worked out explicity. we found the minimal (p,q) multicritical potentials u(x) and v(y), which are polynomials of degree p and q, correspondingly. the loop averages w(x) and w(y) are shown to satisfy the heisenberg relations {w, x} = 1 and {w, y} = 1 essentially coincide with the canonical momenta p and q. the operators x and y create the two kinds of boundaries in the (p,q) model related by the duality (p,q) ↔ (q,p). finally, we present a closed expression for the two two-loop correlators, and interpret its scaling limit.
@background exploiting partial reconfiguration through pcie for a microphone array network emulator the use of microphone arrays for sound-source localization is a well-researched topic. the response of such sensor arrays is dependent on the quantity of microphones operating on the array. a higher number of microphones, however, increase the computational demand, making real-time response challenging. in this paper, we present a filter-and-sum based architecture and several acceleration techniques to provide accurate sound-source localization in real-time. experiments demonstrate how an accurate sound-source localization is obtained in a couple of milliseconds, independently of the number of microphones. finally, we also propose different strategies to further accelerate the sound-source localization while offering increased angular resolution.
@method functionalising opals: versatile self-assembled photonic crystal devices a capillary deposition method for the preparation of opal and inverse opal films has been developed. by this method, one can control the film thickness and the crack arrangement in opal as well as inverse opal structures. this method combines tube capillarity with cell capillarity or with gravity depending on the stability of the suspensions. the combination of tube capillarity with cell capillarity is used to prepare opal films from stable suspensions. the tube capillary transports the suspension, while the cell capillary helps to assemble the spheres. the setup defines the drying fronts, thickness, and crack arrangements of the opal films. the combination of capillarity with gravity is useful for making opal films from unstable suspensions. opal films of spheres with size up to 1 mum can be easily prepared from this combination. here, the gravity influences the arrangement of the spheres. the two-capillary setup has also been used to infiltrate the opal films with a titania precursor. after calcination, inverse titania opal films with skeleton structure have been obtained.

@method effect of diabetes mellitus on rat placenta cellularity. we describe a modified procedure of the diphenylamine-colorimetric method for assay of dna that is shorter than the procedure described by burton. this improvement is achieved by raising the sample incubation temperature to 50 degrees c. the higher temperature hastens and stabilizes the diphenylamine reaction with dna so that absorbances of samples can be measured as early as 3 h after the reaction is started. this shortened assay is able to detect as little as 3 micrograms of calf thymus dna. this method is suitable for measuring dna content of epidermal tissue.
@background euroqol eq-5d and condition-specific measures of health outcome in women with urinary incontinence: reliability, validity and responsiveness objectives to report on the further development of the incontinence quality of life instrument (i-qol), a self-report quality of life measure specific to urinary incontinence (ui), including its measurement model, responsiveness, and effect size.   methods incontinent female patients (141 with stress, 147 with mixed ui) completed the i-qol and comparative measures at screening, pretreatment, and four subsequent follow-up visits during participation in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial assessing the efficacy of duloxetine. psychometric testing followed standardized procedures.   results factor analysis confirmed an overall score and three subscale scores (avoidance and limiting behaviors, psychosocial impacts, and social embarrassment). all scores were internally consistent (alpha = 0.87 to 0.93) and reproducible (icc = 0.87 to 0.91). the pattern of previously reported correlations with the short-form 36-item health survey and psychological well-being schedule were confirmed. responsiveness statistics using changes in the independent measures of stress test pad weight, number of incontinent episodes, and patient global impression of improvement ranged from 0.4 to 0.8. minimally important changes ranged from 2% to 5% in association with these measures and effect sizes.   conclusions in a clinical trial, the i-qol proved to be valid, reproducible, and responsive to treatment for ui in women.
@result hysteretic behavior of bladder afferent neurons in response to changes in bladder pressure although sacral anterior root neuromodulation (sarn) has proven to be effective in patients with neurogenic bladder, it is not widely accepted due to the need to conduct a dorsal rhizotomy, and commercially available sarn devices are not usually equipped with a closed-loop controller for the automatic regulation of bladder functions. therefore, there is still a need for a more effective electrical neuromodulation scheme to restore bladder function. intravesical pressure (ivp) is the major biosignal that reflects the state of bladder conditions. the present study develops a closed-loop control strategy for improving bladder emptying and verifies its performance using animal experiments. two channel outputs of electrical currents triggered by ivp-feedback signals were set to automatically regulate a rat's pudendal nerve for selective nerve stimulation and blocking. under this experimental design, a series of in vivo animal experiments were conducted on anesthetized rats, including the computational characterization of biosignals, the development of an intermittent high-frequency blocking current waveform for blocking the nerve, and verification of the control strategy. results show that the ivp-feedback control strategy for dual-channel pudendal neuromodulation performed well in animal experiments and could be utilized to selectively stimulate and block the pudendal nerve to augment bladder contraction and restore external urethral sphincter bursting activity to improve bladder emptying. this study demonstrates the feasibility of the ivp-based feedback-control strategy with animal experiments. the results could provide a basis for developing a sophisticated neural prosthesis for restoring bladder function in clinical use or for neurophysiological study.
@result complex memories in honeybees: can there be more than two? poor fetal growth is linked with long-term detrimental effects on health in adulthood. here we investigate whether the lifespan of male mice is affected by their growth rate when they were suckling and find that limiting growth during that period not only increases longevity but also protects against the life-shortening effect of an obesity-inducing diet later on. by contrast, we find that lifespan is considerably shortened if the postnatal period of growth is accelerated to make up for reduced growth in utero, and that, in addition, these mice are susceptible to the adverse effects on longevity of an obesity-inducing diet after weaning.
@background inhalation toxicokinetics of p-dichlorobenzene and daily absorption and internal accumulation in chronic low-level exposure to humans the biotransformation and kinetics of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-dcb) were studied in male wistar rats at three oral dose levels (10, 50 and 250 mg/kg). the effect of induction of cyp2e1 by isoniazid on the kinetics and biotransformation was determined. excretion was predominantly via the urine (78-85%) and to a small extent via the faeces (2-5%). the relative contributions of these routes were not dose dependent. excretion via the bile ranged from less than 5% at the low dose level to 30% at the high dose level. the major biliary metabolite was the glucuronide of 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-dcp). the time point at which the plasma concentrations of the parent compound and the metabolites were maximal (tcmax) as well as the maximum concentrations (cmax) increased with higher dose level. induction by isoniazid resulted in a faster urinary elimination, whereas tcmax and cmax were lower for induced rats. in addition, the area under the blood curve (auc) was smaller and total clearance was higher for induced rats. 1,4-dcb was mainly metabolized to 2,5-dcp (ca. 90%), which was detected in the urine as its sulfate (50-60%), glucuronide (20-30%) and the free form (5-10%). minor metabolites were the n-acetyl-cysteine-s-dihydro-hydroxy-1,4-dichlorobenzene and the corresponding dehydrated n-acetyl-cysteine-s-1,4-dichlorobenzene, which comprised ca. 10% of total metabolites. no hydroquinones were observed for the male wistar rat, not even under conditions of induced oxidative metabolism.

@background follicular thyroid carcinoma invades venous rather than lymphatic vessels we retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the mayo clinic between 1946 and 1970. the diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. the 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). all patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. at the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. on the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. multivariate analysis (by cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. these patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. the identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer.
@method representation learning for single-channel source separation and bandwidth extension we present a signal processing algorithm to convert speech signals with "standard telephone" quality into 7 khz wideband speech. a statistical approach based on a hidden markov model (hmm) is used, which takes into account several features of the band-limited speech. the narrowband input signal is classified into a limited number of speech sounds (hmm states) for which the wideband spectral envelope is estimated using the pre-trained model. the enhanced speech exhibits a significantly improved quality without objectionable artifacts.

@background left atrial decompression pump for severe heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: theoretical and clinical considerations. background the current classification of patients with new york heart association class iv symptoms does not offer adequate description to allow optimal selection of patients for the current options of medical and pacing therapies, cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support.   methods seven clinical profiles and an arrhythmia modifier were developed and implemented into the first year of data collection for the interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support (intermacs). the intermacs coordinators' council provided ongoing feedback regarding the characterization of patients receiving implantable devices.   results the definition of 7 clinical profiles revealed that 80% of current devices are being used in the 2 profiles with the highest levels of clinical compromise. the intermacs coordinators' council helped to identify gaps in the characterization of hospitalized patients on temporary assist devices and of homebound patients with resting symptoms, which has led to revised definitions of profile 3 and 4 and the addition of 2 new modifiers, for temporary circulatory support devices in the hospital, and for frequent rehospitalization of patients at home.   conclusions patients considered for mechanical circulatory support can now be classified using the 7 profiles plus 3 modifiers developed through intermacs. further understanding these profiles and their impact on outcome should help to better select patients and therapies in the advanced stages of disease.
@background comparison of registered and published outcomes in randomized controlled trials: a systematic review purposein 2005 the international committee of medical journal editors issued a requirement that all randomized controlled trials (rcts) be registered primarily to prevent selective reporting (publication bias). however, registries allow for alterations in study protocol. changes occurring before (or after) study completion could invalidate the original study intent, leading to publication of misleading conclusions. in rcts involving critically ill patients, these concerns may be particularly acute because mortality is high and conditions investigated are usually syndromes rather than specific diseases. this study was conducted to estimate the registration rate of rcts in critical care; and, among registered rcts, to determine timing of registration and whether sample size or primary outcome were altered.methodswe searched the medline database for rcts that began after or continued through july 2005. we determined whether each trial had been registered and, for registered trials, compared registry data to data in the published manuscript.resultsapproximately two-thirds (66 %) of trials were registered. of these, 66 % of registrations occurred after enrolment had commenced. overall, 6 % (5/90) of trials appropriately registered a sample size which was unchanged from the interval between registration and publication, and only 12 % (11/90) reported primary outcomes that were both appropriately registered and unchanged.conclusionsnon-registration, or registration after trial initiation, are common in rcts of critically ill patients. among registered trials important protocol changes are often made between trial commencement and publication. this study identifies and quantifies the extent of this serious—but correctable—problem for rcts in critically ill patients.
@background economic optimization of wastewater treatment plants using non linear model predictive control abstract activated sludge wastewater treatment processes are difficult to be controlled because of their complex and nonlinear behavior, however, the control of the dissolved oxygen level in the reactors plays an important role in the operation of the facility. for this reason a new approach is studied in this paper using simulated case-study approach: model predictive control (mpc) has been applied to control the dissolved oxygen concentration in an aerobic reactor of a wastewater treatment plant. the control strategy is investigated and evaluated on two examples using systematic evaluation criteria: in a simulation benchmark – developed for the evaluation of different control strategies – the oxygen concentration has to be maintained at a given level in an aerobic basin; and a changing oxygen concentration in an alternating activated sludge process is controlled using mpc technique. the effect of some mpc tuning parameters (prediction horizon, input weight, sampling time) are also investigated. the results show that mpc can be effectively used for dissolved oxygen control in wastewater treatment plants.
@result relation between clinical depression risk and physical activity and time spent watching television in older women: a 10-year prospective follow-up study. background: a growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, but there are limited data on black women.purpose: the objective was to evaluate the association between leisure time physical activity and depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.methods: participants included 35,224 women ages 21 to 69 from the blackwomen’s health study, a follow-up study of african american women in which data are collected biennially by mail questionnaire.women answered questions on past and current exercise levels at baseline (1995) and follow-up (1997). the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) was used to measure depressive symptoms in 1999. women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded. we used multivariate logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms (ces-d score <= 16) with control for potential confounders.results: adult vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (or = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.71−0.82) relative to never active women; the or was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% ci = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% ci = 0.77-0.91). although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (body mass index <= 30).conclusions: leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.
@background why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing? humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. for example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. this superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. these models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. a review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. the neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. the hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [r.c. miall, neural computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. by implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.
@method invasive alien plants affect grassland ant communities, colony size and foraging behaviour abstract.a method to estimate the number of workers in myrmica ant nests on abandoned meadows was developed based on removal of workers. ant workers have a tendency to climb up on wooden sticks put into their nests, therefore, assuming that the number of workers removed on sticks is related to the total number of workers within the nests, regression models for myrmica rubra, m. ruginodis and m. scabrinodis may be built. we used a general regression model to perform a backward stepwise elimination of explanatory variables. these were the number of workers removed on sticks, temperature at the nest and site (a categorical variable). in case of each species the final model contained only the number of workers removed as a significant variable. the method is apparently non-destructive as we did not observe decreased survival of nests surveyed as compared to control nests. the method can be a very useful tool in population studies of ants as well as in biodiversity projects, where ants are used as bioinidcators.
@background escape of sgs1 from rad9 inhibition reduces the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dna end resection abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
@method force coordination in static manipulation tasks: effects of the change in direction and handedness the purpose of the study was to evaluate a method for testing bimanual prehension based on a novel experimental device. the device consists of two handles allowing for simultaneous measurement of bimanual hand grip forces (gf) and different patterns of load forces (lf) exerted during compression and tension along the longitudinal axis. in order to assess the reliability of the obtained measures, eight healthy subjects were tested over three consecutive test, while three moderately impaired neurological patients were tested once. in healthy subjects, high coordination was observed between gfs and lfs, as well as between two gfs and two lfs. the results also suggest a satisfactory task performance in regards to exerting the instructed lf profile, as well as a sufficient, but not excessive gf. the reliability of most of the assessed variables proved to be either moderate or high. when compared to healthy subjects, the data obtained from neurological patients mainly revealed irregular patterns of lfs, excessive gfs, as well as a relatively weak relationship between gfs and lfs. it was concluded that the evaluated methodological approach can be applied not only to explore uni- and bi-manual coordination of arm and hand grip forces in various prehensile activities, but also to serve as a basis for future development of specific clinical tests for neurological patients and other populations that demonstrate impaired hand function.
@background hippocampal damage and exploratory preferences in rats: memory for objects, places, and contexts. based on behavioral procedures aimed at measuring working or data-based memory for spatial location, response, and visual object information, it is shown that there is a triple dissociation among the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and extrastriate visual cortex in mediating spatial location, response, and visual object information, respectively. the hippocampus appears to subserve only spatial location, the caudate nucleus only response, and the extrastriate visual cortex only visual object information. the results support the neurobiological foundation of the attribute memory model.
@background on bahinia pondaungensis, an alleged early anthropoid a new genus and species of anthropoid primate, bahinia pondaungensis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the yashe kyitchaung locality in the late middle eocene pondaung formation (myanmar). it is related to eosimias, but it is represented by more complete remains, including upper dentition with associated lower jaw fragment. it is interpreted as a new representative of the family eosimiidae, which corresponds to the sister group of the amphipithecidae and of all other anthropoids. eosimiidae are now recorded from three distinct middle eocene localities in asia, giving support to the hypothesis of an asian origin of anthropoids.
@background humic acid decreases acute toxicity and ventilation frequency in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to acid mine drainage. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
@background atrx loss promotes tumor growth and impairs nonhomologous end joining dna repair in glioma glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. however, dna copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. to explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric gbm samples. somatic mutations in the h3.3-atrx-daxx chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). recurrent mutations in h3f3a, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant h3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (k27m, g34r/g34v) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. mutations in atrx (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome x-linked) and daxx (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for h3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a g34r or g34v h3.3 mutation. somatic tp53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with h3f3a and/or atrx mutations. screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed h3f3a mutations to be specific to gbm and highly prevalent in children and young adults. furthermore, the presence of h3f3a/atrx-daxx/tp53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. this is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult gbm pathogenesis.
@result bronchoalveolar lavage versus bolus administration of lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant in meconium aspiration in newborn lambs background. animal-derived, protein-containing surfactants seem to be superior to protein-free surfactants. lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant containing a surfactant protein-b peptide analog, has been shown to be effective in animal models and phase ii clinical trials. to date, lucinactant has not been compared with an animal-derived surfactant in a premature animal model. objective. the objective was to compare the acute and sustained effects of lucinactant among premature lambs with respiratory distress syndrome (rds) with the effects of a natural porcine surfactant (poractant-α). methods. after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation twin premature lambs were assigned randomly to the lucinactant group (30 mg/ml, 5.8 ml/kg) or the poractant-α group (80 mg/ml, 2.2 ml/kg). heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, arterial ph, blood gas values, and lung mechanics were recorded for 12 hours. results. baseline fetal ph values were similar for the 2 groups (ph 7.27). after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation, severe rds developed (ph: <7.08; paco2: >80 mm hg; pao2: <40 mm hg; dynamic compliance: <0.08 ml/cm h2o per kg). after surfactant instillation, similar improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics were observed for the lucinactant and poractant-α groups at 1 hour (ph: 7.3 ± 0.1 vs 7.4 ± 0.1; paco2: 8 ± 18 mm hg vs 40 ± 8 mm hg; pao2: 167 ± 52 mm hg vs 259 ± 51 mm hg; dynamic compliance: 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg vs 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg). the improvements in lung function were sustained, with no differences between groups. cardiovascular profiles remained stable in both groups. conclusions. among preterm lambs with severe rds, lucinactant produced improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics similar to those observed with a porcine-derived surfactant.
@background does the presence of non-breeders enhance the fitness of breeders? an experimental analysis in the clown anemonefish amphiprion percula conflicts of interest are part and parcel of living in a social group, although these can reduce the fitness of individual members. here i show that clownfish (amphiprion percula) adjust their size and growth rate according to their position in the group hierarchy, maintaining a well-defined size difference with respect to individuals above them in social rank. this strategy to prevent conflict is a surprising departure from the more usual ploy used by many animals of modifying their behaviour within the group.
@background extended effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary mortality in vienna air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants. the former include nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and sulphur dioxide (so2). the latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points—for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (pm10) or ,2.5 mm (pm2.5). because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. why should cardiologists care about ambient air? it has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the meuse valley fog of 1930 or the london smog of 1952. these episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. however, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs. maı̂tre et al. gathered the available epidemiological evidence on the association between coronary disease and air pollution at current ambient concentrations. from both biological and public health perspectives, one should distinguish between acute and long-term effects of air pollution.
@method the tip-link antigen, a protein associated with the transduction complex of sensory hair cells, is protocadherin-15 tip links are extracellular, cell-surface-associated filaments of unknown molecular composition that are thought to gate the mechanotransducer channel of the sensory hair cell. they disappear from the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation and lanthanum treatment and resist degradation by the protease subtilisin. a monoclonal antibody derived from a hybridoma screen identified a novel antigen associated with tip links, the tip-link antigen. the tip-link antigen is also associated with kinocilial links, subtilisin-resistant filaments that are sensitive to calcium chelation and connect the kinocilium to the tallest stereocilia of the hair bundle. furthermore, the tip-link antigen is expressed in the retina, where it is associated with the ciliary calyx, a ring of microvilli that surrounds the outer segment of the photoreceptor. the tip-link antigen rapidly disappears from the surface of the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation. it is also subtilisin resistant, relative to the ankle-link antigen, an antigen associated with another type of hair bundle link. the tip-link antigen is lanthanum sensitive and, like tip links, reappears on the surface of the hair bundle after calcium chelation. the monoclonal antibody to the tip-link antigen immunoprecipitates two concanavalin a-reactive polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 200 and 250 kda from detergent extracts of the retina. these results provide the first identification of a cell surface antigen associated with tip links, indicate that tip links share properties in common with kinocilial links, and reveal a second epitope that, along with the ankle-link antigen, is common to both sensory hair bundles and the ciliary calyx of photoreceptors.
@background specific sequences in the n-terminal domain of human small heat-shock protein hspb6 dictate preferential hetero-oligomerization with the orthologue hspb1 atp-independent small heat-shock proteins (shsps) are an essential component of the cellular chaperoning machinery. under both normal and stress conditions, shsps bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent their irreversible aggregation. canonical vertebrate shsps, such as the α-crystallins, form large polydisperse oligomers from which smaller, functionally active subspecies dissociate. here we focus on human hspb6 which, despite having considerable homology to the α-crystallins in both the n-terminal region and the signature α-crystallin domain (acd), only forms dimers in solution that represent the basic chaperoning subspecies. we addressed the three-dimensional structure and functional properties of hspb6 in a hybrid study employing x-ray crystallography, solution small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs), mutagenesis, size-exclusion chromatography and chaperoning assays. the crystal structure of a proteolytically stable fragment reveals typical acd dimers which further form tetrameric assemblies as a result of extensive inter-dimer patching of the β4/β8 grooves. the patching is surprisingly mediated by tripeptide motifs, found in the n-terminal domain directly adjacent to the acd, that are resembling but distinct from the canonical ixi sequence commonly binding this groove. by combining the crystal structure with saxs data for the full-length protein, we derive a molecular model of the latter. in solution, hspb6 shows a strong attractive self-interaction, a property that correlates with its chaperoning activity. both properties are dictated by the unstructured yet compact n-terminal domain, specifically a region highly conserved across vertebrate shsps.
@background interstitial f(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-pgf(2α) as a biomarker of oxidative stress after severe human traumatic brain injury. mammalian cells express a transport system known as system xc−, which is an exchange agency specific for anionic forms of cystine and glutamate. system xc− activity is important to maintain both intracellular glutathione levels and the redox balance between cystine and cysteine in the extracellular milieu. we have shown that the cloned cdnas encoding the transporter for system xc− consist of two components, xct and the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen. in the present study, we have investigated the mrna distribution for these components in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. the xct mrna was expressed in the area postrema, subfornical organ, habenular nucleus, hypothalamic area, and ependymal cells of the lateral wall of the third ventricle in the adult mouse brain. a strong signal was also detected in the meninges in both adult and fetal mouse brains. the mrna expression of the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xct mrna was detected. these data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xct functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen to elicit system xc− activity. the expression of system xc− in meninges and some circumventricular organs may suggest that this transporter contributes to the maintenance of the redox state (i.e., cysteine/cystine ratio) in the csf.
@method stacked deconvolutional network for semantic segmentation we present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3d geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. by examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. we built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 ground-truth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. to further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data. our system produces an accurate prediction of geometric context of video achieving 96% accuracy across main geometric classes.
@background on a weakness of the tu-deng function and its repair after the improvement by courtois and meier of the algebraic attacks on stream ciphers and the introduction of the related notion of algebraic immunity, several constructions of infinite classes of boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity have been proposed. all of them gave functions whose algebraic degrees are high enough for resisting the berlekamp-massey attack and the recent ronjom-helleseth attack, but whose nonlinearities either achieve the worst possible value (given by lobanov's bound) or are slightly superior to it. hence, these functions do not allow resistance to fast correlation attacks. moreover, they do not behave well with respect to fast algebraic attacks. in this paper, we study an infinite class of functions which achieve an optimum algebraic immunity. we prove that they have an optimum algebraic degree and a much better nonlinearity than all the previously obtained infinite classes of functions. we check that, at least for small values of the number of variables, the functions of this class have in fact a very good nonlinearity and also a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks.
@background androgen deprivation followed by acute androgen stimulation selectively sensitizes ar-positive prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) can lead to the development of genomic rearrangements, which are hallmarks of cancer. fusions between tmprss2, encoding the transmembrane serine protease isoform 2, and erg, encoding the v-ets erythroblastosis virus e26 oncogene homolog, are among the most common oncogenic rearrangements observed in human cancer. we show that androgen signaling promotes co-recruitment of androgen receptor and topoisomerase ii beta (top2b) to sites of tmprss2-erg genomic breakpoints, triggering recombinogenic top2b-mediated dsbs. furthermore, androgen stimulation resulted in de novo production of tmprss2-erg fusion transcripts in a process that required top2b and components of the dsb repair machinery. finally, unlike normal prostate epithelium, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia cells showed strong coexpression of androgen receptor and top2b. these findings implicate androgen-induced top2b-mediated dsbs in generating tmprss2-erg rearrangements.
@background yeast “make-accumulate-consume” life strategy evolved as a multi-step process that predates the whole genome duplication modern yeast living in fleshy fruits rapidly convert sugars into bulk ethanol through pyruvate. pyruvate loses carbon dioxide to produce acetaldehyde, which is reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (adh1) to ethanol, which accumulates. yeast later consumes the accumulated ethanol, exploiting adh2, an adh1 homolog differing by 24 (of 348) amino acids. as many microorganisms cannot grow in ethanol, accumulated ethanol may help yeast defend resources in the fruit. we report here the resurrection of the last common ancestor of adh1 and adh2, called adha. the kinetic behavior of adha suggests that the ancestor was optimized to make (not consume) ethanol. this is consistent with the hypothesis that before the adh1-adh2 duplication, yeast did not accumulate ethanol for later consumption but rather used adha to recycle nadh generated in the glycolytic pathway. silent nucleotide dating suggests that the adh1-adh2 duplication occurred near the time of duplication of several other proteins involved in the accumulation of ethanol, possibly in the cretaceous age when fleshy fruits arose. these results help to connect the chemical behavior of these enzymes through systems analysis to a time of global ecosystem change, a small but useful step towards a planetary systems biology.
@background leukocytes and coronary artery disease oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxldl) has been characterized as an atherogenic molecule responsible for the induction of a variety of gene products. one such gene, tissue factor (tf), the cellular initiator of the coagulation cascade, is not expressed in normal vascular tissue but is expressed by monocytes and foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we examined the effect of oxldl on tf expression in cultured human adherent monocytes. endotoxin-free oxldl alone did not induce tf expression in adherent monocytes. however, oxldl significantly enhanced tf expression induced by the inflammatory mediator, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), in a time- and dose-dependent manner. in contrast, oxldl did not alter lps-mediated production of interleukin-8 and actually inhibited lps-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting that some aspects of the signaling pathways for tf induction differ from those of other lps-responsive monocyte/macrophage gene products. thus, this study documents specific modulation of the expression of lps-inducible genes in monocytic cells by oxldl. factors that enhance tf expression in monocyte/macrophage cells present in atheroma may contribute to the severity of thrombotic episodes and complications observed in atherosclerosis.
@result cell proliferation is influenced by bulbectomy and normalized by imipramine treatment in a region-specific manner the main olfactory bulb (mob) is the first relay on the olfactory sensory pathway and the target of the neural progenitor cells generated in the subventricular zone (svz) lining the lateral ventricles and which migrate along the rostral extension of the svz, also called the rostral migratory stream (rms). within the mob, the neuroblasts differentiate into granular and periglomerular interneurons. a reduction in the number of granule cells during sensory deprivation suggests that neurogenesis may be influenced by afferent activity. here, we show that unilateral sensory deafferentation of the mob by axotomy of the olfactory receptor neurons increases apoptotic cell death in the svz and along the rostro-caudal extent of the rms. the vast majority of dying cells in the rms are migrating neuroblasts as indicated by double terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated utp nick-end labeling/psa-ncam labeling. counting bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in animals killed immediately or 4 days after tracer administration showed a bilateral increase in proliferation in the svz and rms which was balanced by cell death on the operated side. these data suggest that olfactory inputs are required for the survival of newborn neural progenitors. the greatest enhancement in proliferation occurred in the extension of the rms located in the mob, revealing a population of local precursors mitotically stimulated following axotomy. together, these findings indicate that olfactory inputs may strongly modulate the balance between neurogenesis and apoptosis in the svz and rms and provide a model for further investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity-dependent neuronal plasticity.
@background sex-dependent responses to increased parental effort in the pied flycatcher a fundamental premise of life‐history theory is that organisms that increase current reproductive investment suffer increased mortality. possibly the most studied life‐history phenotypic relationship is the trade‐off between parental effort and survival. however, evidence supporting this trade‐off is equivocal. here, we conducted a meta‐analysis to test the generality of this tenet. using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. our results suggest that the trade‐off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life‐history trade‐offs.
@background the impact of spike timing variability on the signal-encoding performance of neural spiking models cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. to investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. we analyzed a “high-input regime” in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. to produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. we find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50–100 neurons. these column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. we find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10–50 msec). finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons—that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. the solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.
@background tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (tslc1), a novel tumor suppressor gene, is implicated in the regulation of proliferation, invasion, cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma chemo- and radio-therapeutic regimens frequently kill cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, a cell-death subroutine that involves the activation of a particular class of proteases called caspases. in a recent issue of nature medicine, huang et al. (2011) show that caspase activation in dying tumor cells causes the release of soluble lipid messengers, notably prostaglandin e2, that stimulate tumor cell proliferation. in this short review, we will discuss the clinical and therapeutic implications of these findings.
@method detecting variability in matlab/simulink models: an industry-inspired technique and its evaluation case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. however, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. this paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. the content is based on the authors’ own experience from conducting and reading case studies. the terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. we present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.
@background swimming behavior and velocities of barnacle cyprids in a downwelling flume field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. it is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. however, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. a dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. however, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. the numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. a simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. the implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. the dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. for near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. these hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. the interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off
@result the prosecco server for chemical shift predictions in ordered and disordered proteins nmr chemical shifts provide important local structural information for proteins and are key in recently described protein structure generation protocols. we describe a new chemical shift prediction program, sparta+, which is based on artificial neural networking. the neural network is trained on a large carefully pruned database, containing 580 proteins for which high-resolution x-ray structures and nearly complete backbone and 13cβ chemical shifts are available. the neural network is trained to establish quantitative relations between chemical shifts and protein structures, including backbone and side-chain conformation, h-bonding, electric fields and ring-current effects. the trained neural network yields rapid chemical shift prediction for backbone and 13cβ atoms, with standard deviations of 2.45, 1.09, 0.94, 1.14, 0.25 and 0.49 ppm for δ15n, δ13c’, δ13cα, δ13cβ, δ1hα and δ1hn, respectively, between the sparta+ predicted and experimental shifts for a set of eleven validation proteins. these results represent a modest but consistent improvement (2–10%) over the best programs available to date, and appear to be approaching the limit at which empirical approaches can predict chemical shifts.
@background when pain really matters: a vicarious-pain brain marker tracks empathy for pain in the romantic partner the current study investigates whether mere stereotypes are sufficient to modulate empathic responses to other people's (mis)fortunes, how these modulations manifest in the brain, and whether affective and neural responses relate to endorsing harm against different outgroup targets. participants feel least bad when misfortunes befall envied targets and worst when misfortunes befall pitied targets, as compared with ingroup targets. participants are also least willing to endorse harming pitied targets, despite pitied targets being outgroup members. however, those participants who exhibit increased activation in functionally defined insula/middle frontal gyrus when viewing pity targets experience positive events not only report feeling worse about those events but also more willing to harm pity targets in a tradeoff scenario. similarly, increased activation in anatomically defined bilateral anterior insula, in response to positive events, predicts increased willingness to harm envy targets, but decreased willingness to harm ingroup targets, above and beyond self-reported affect in response to the events. stereotypes' specific content and not just outgroup membership modulates empathic responses and related behavioral consequences including harm.
@method language adaptation experiments via cross-lingual embeddings for related languages the zero-shot paradigm exploits vector-based word representations extracted from text corpora with unsupervised methods to learn general mapping functions from other feature spaces onto word space, where the words associated to the nearest neighbours of the mapped vectors are used as their linguistic labels. we show that the neighbourhoods of the mapped elements are strongly polluted by hubs, vectors that tend to be near a high proportion of items, pushing their correct labels down the neighbour list. after illustrating the problem empirically, we propose a simple method to correct it by taking the proximity distribution of potential neighbours across many mapped vectors into account. we show that this correction leads to consistent improvements in realistic zero-shot experiments in the cross-lingual, image labeling and image retrieval domains.
@method an integrated weights particle filter algorithm based on correlation particle estimation and sequential importance re-sampling this article analyses the recently suggested particle approach to filtering time series. we suggest that the algorithm is not robust to outliers for two reasons: the design of the simulators and the use of the discrete support to represent the sequentially updating prior distribution. here we tackle the first of these problems.

@method evidence for peroxynitrite as a signaling molecule in flow-dependent activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
@background synergistic processing of visual contours across cortical layers in v1 and v2 the traditional view on visual processing emphasizes a hierarchy: local line segments are first linked into global contours, which in turn are assembled into more complex forms. distinct from this bottom-up viewpoint, here we provide evidence for a theoretical framework whereby objects and their parts are processed almost concurrently in a bidirectional cortico-cortical loop. by simultaneous recordings from v1 and v4 in awake monkeys, we found that information about global contours in a cluttered background emerged initially in v4, started ∼40 ms later in v1, and continued to develop in parallel in both areas. detailed analysis of neuronal response properties implicated contour integration to emerge from both bottom-up and reentrant processes. our results point to an incremental integration mechanism: feedforward assembling accompanied by feedback disambiguating to define and enhance the global contours and to suppress background noise. the consequence is a parallel accumulation of contour information over multiple cortical areas.
@background low-frequency atmospheric acoustic energy associated with vortices produced by thunderstorms abstract this paper attempts to explain the “whining” or “hissing” sound reported from tornadoes. the leading hypothesis is that the air masses involved in the tornado circulation execute some free vibrations. it is found that these vibrations may be in the audible range for a small vortex whose radius is of the order of 10 m. or less. a formula is obtained which relates the frequency of the tone to the inner radius of the vortex. this formula is amenable to experimental verification.
@background evaluation of a urine pooling strategy for the rapid and cost-efficient prevalence classification of schistosomiasis financial resources tend to be limited in schistosomiasis endemic areas, forcing program managers to balance financial and scientific considerations when selecting detection assays. therefore, we compared the costs of using single stool kato-katz, triplicate stool kato-katz, and point-of-contact circulating cathodic antigen (poc-cca) assays for the detection of schistosoma mansoni infection. economic and financial costs were estimated from the viewpoint of a schistosomiasis control program using the ingredients approach. costs related to specimen collection, sample processing and analysis, and treatment delivery were considered. analysis inputs and assumptions were tested using one-way and two-way sensitivity analysis. the total per-person cost of performing the single kato-katz, triplicate kato-katz, and poc-cca was us$6.89, us$17.54, and us$7.26, respectively. major cost drivers included labor, transportation, and supplies. in addition, we provide a costing tool to guide program managers in evaluating detection costs in specific settings, as costs may vary temporally and spatially.
@background robots for elementary schools robots increasingly have the potential to interact with people in daily life. it is believed that, based on this ability, they will play an essential role in human society in the not-so-distant future. this article examined the proposition that robots could form relationships with children and that children might learn from robots as they learn from other children. in this article, this idea is studied in an 18-day field trial held at a japanese elementary school. two english-speaking "robovie" robots interacted with first- and sixth-grade pupils at the perimeter of their respective classrooms. using wireless identification tags and sensors, these robots identified and interacted with children who came near them. the robots gestured and spoke english with the children, using a vocabulary of about 300 sentences for speaking and 50 words for recognition. the children were given a brief picture-word matching english test at the start of the trial, after 1 week and after 2 weeks. interactions were counted using the tags, and video and audio were recorded. in the majority of cases, a child's friends were present during the interactions. interaction with the robot was frequent in the 1st week, and then it fell off sharply by the 2nd week. nonetheless, some children continued to interact with the robot. interaction time during the 2nd week predicted improvements in english skill at the posttest, controlling for pretest scores. further analyses indicate that the robots may have been more successful in establishing common ground and influence when the children already had some initial proficiency or interest in english. these results suggest that interactive robots should be designed to have something in common with their users, providing a social as well as technical challenge.
@method stepwise catalytic mechanism via short-lived intermediate inferred from combined qm/mm merp and pes calculations on retaining glycosyltransferase ppgalnact2 we present the theoretical and technical foundations of the amsterdam density functional (adf) program with a survey of the characteristics of the code (numerical integration, density fitting for the coulomb potential, and sto basis functions). recent developments enhance the efficiency of adf (e.g., parallelization, near order‐n scaling, qm/mm) and its functionality (e.g., nmr chemical shifts, cosmo solvent effects, zora relativistic method, excitation energies, frequency‐dependent (hyper)polarizabilities, atomic vdd charges). in the applications section we discuss the physical model of the electronic structure and the chemical bond, i.e., the kohn–sham molecular orbital (mo) theory, and illustrate the power of the kohn–sham mo model in conjunction with the adf‐typical fragment approach to quantitatively understand and predict chemical phenomena. we review the “activation‐strain ts interaction” (ats) model of chemical reactivity as a conceptual framework for understanding how activation barriers of various types of (competing) reaction mechanisms arise and how they may be controlled, for example, in organic chemistry or homogeneous catalysis. finally, we include a brief discussion of exemplary applications in the field of biochemistry (structure and bonding of dna) and of time‐dependent density functional theory (tddft) to indicate how this development further reinforces the adf tools for the analysis of chemical phenomena. © 2001 john wiley & sons, inc. j comput chem 22: 931–967, 2001
@result relationship of the changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
@method shift work and diabetes – a systematic review objective: this study investigated the effect of alternating shift work (asw) on the onset of diabetes mellitus in japanese workers compared with onset in day-shift work (dsw). methods: a longitudinal study was carried out on a dsw group (n = 3203) and asw group (n = 2426) of a steel company who received their annual health checkups over a 10-year period between 1991 and 2001. the association between job schedule type and onset of diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin a1c ≥6.0% or medication) was investigated by multivariate pooled logistic regression analyses. results: the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the development of diabetes mellitus in the asw group compared with the dsw group was 1.35 (1.05–1.75). conclusions: our study revealed that the asw is an independent risk factor for the onset of diabetes mellitus.

@method a critical analysis of child and adolescent mental health services policy in england ▪ abstract this paper provides a survey of critical discourse analysis (cda), a recent school of discourse analysis that concerns itself with relations of power and inequality in language. cda explicitly intends to incorporate social-theoretical insights into discourse analysis and advocates social commitment and interventionism in research. the main programmatic features and domains of enquiry of cda are discussed, with emphasis on attempts toward theory formation by one of cda's most prominent scholars, norman fairclough. another section reviews the genesis and disciplinary growth of cda, mentions some of the recent critical reactions to it, and situates it within the wider picture of a new critical paradigm developing in a number of language-oriented (sub) disciplines. in this critical paradigm, topics such as ideology, inequality, and power figure prominently, and many scholars productively attempt to incorporate social-theoretical insights into the study of language.
@background functional characterization of fusarium verticillioides cpp1, a gene encoding a putative protein phosphatase 2a catalytic subunit. yeast cells can select bud sites in either of two distinct spatial patterns. a cells and alpha cells typically bud in an axial pattern, in which both mother and daughter cells form new buds adjacent to the preceding division site. in contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. the bud3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of bud3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. the sequence of bud3 predicts a product (bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. however, immunofluorescence localization of bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. the bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. these single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. the bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (cdc3p, cdc10p, cdc11p, and cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. in addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. taken together, the data suggest that bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. as the expression and localization of bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.
@method the role of information search in seeking alternative treatment for back pain: a qualitative analysis this research used the somewhat new methodology of convergent interviews to develop a conceptual framework about relationship constructs in an internet environment. more generally, this article describes and illustrates the processes and the strengths of convergent interviewing to investigate under‐researched areas, and compares it with alternative qualitative techniques like in‐depth interviews, case research and focus groups. the illustration involves interviews conducted with marketing managers and business consultants from ten service companies, about internet and relationship marketing. it is argued that convergent interviewing is more appropriate than some other qualitative methods to investigate under‐researched areas where there are few experts because it provides a way of quickly converging on key issues in the area, an efficient mechanism for data analysis after each interview, and a way of deciding when to stop collecting data. convergent interviews could become another useful qualitative research method to explore new issues about emerging marketing phenomena.
@method mouse model of pulmonary cavitary tuberculosis and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 active tuberculosis (tb) often presents with advanced pulmonary disease, including irreversible lung damage and cavities. cavitary pathology contributes to antibiotic failure, transmission, morbidity and mortality. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), in particular mmp‐1, are implicated in tb pathogenesis. we explored the mechanisms relating mmp/timp imbalance to cavity formation in a modified rabbit model of cavitary tb. our model resulted in consistent progression of consolidation to human‐like cavities (100% by day 28), with resultant bacillary burdens (>107 cfu/g) far greater than those found in matched granulomatous tissue (105 cfu/g). using a novel, breath‐hold computed tomography (ct) scanning and image analysis protocol, we showed that cavities developed rapidly from areas of densely consolidated tissue. radiological change correlated with a decrease in functional lung tissue, as estimated by changes in lung density during controlled pulmonary expansion (r2 = 0.6356, p < 0.0001). we demonstrated that the expression of interstitial collagenase (mmp‐1) was specifically greater in cavitary compared to granulomatous lesions (p < 0.01), and that timp‐3 significantly decreased at the cavity surface. our findings demonstrated that an mmp‐1/timp imbalance is associated with the progression of consolidated regions to cavities containing very high bacterial burdens. our model provided mechanistic insight, correlating with human disease at the pathological, microbiological and molecular levels. it also provided a strategy to investigate therapeutics in the context of complex tb pathology. we used these findings to predict a mmp/timp balance in active tb and confirmed this in human plasma, revealing the potential of mmp/timp levels as key components of a diagnostic matrix aimed at distinguishing active from latent tb (ppv = 92.9%, 95% ci 66.1–99.8%, npv = 85.6%; 95% ci 77.0–91.9%). copyright © 2014 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd
@background trends in mortality and medical spending in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia: 1993–2005 purpose to assess the variation in length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and to determine whether patients who are treated in hospitals with shorter mean stays have worse medical outcomes.   subjects and methods we prospectively studied a cohort of 1,188 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia who had been admitted to one community and three university teaching hospitals. we compared patients' mean length of stay, mortality, hospital readmission, return to usual activities, return to work, and pneumonia-related symptoms among the four study hospitals. all outcomes were adjusted for baseline differences in severity of illness and comorbidity.   results adjusted interhospital differences in mean length of stay ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 days (p <0.001). when the risk of each medical outcome was compared between patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to longer stay hospitals, there were no differences in mortality [relative risk (rr) = 0.7; 95% ci, 0.3 to 1.7], hospital readmission (rr = 0.8; 95% ci, 0.5 to 1.2), return to usual activities (rr = 1.1; 95% ci, 0.9 to 1.3), or return to work (rr = 1.2; 95% ci, 0.8 to 2.0) during the first 14 days after discharge, or in the mean number of pneumonia-related symptoms 30 days after admission (p = 0.54).   conclusions we observed substantial interhospital variation in the lengths of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. the finding that medical outcomes were similar in patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to hospitals with longer mean lengths of stay suggests that hospitals with longer stays may be able to reduce the mean duration of hospitalization for this disease without adversely affecting patient outcomes.
@background the halos‐nd model: a step in the journey of predicting hospital length of stay after liver transplantation the effect of obesity on outcomes following liver transplantation remains unclear. we reviewed our experience with 302 liver transplants in 277 patients from september 1989 to september 1996 to determine the effect of body mass on outcome. two hundred and seventeen transplants were performed in patients with a body mass index (bmi)<30 kg/m2, 55 in patients with a bmi of 30–34 kg/m2 (obese), and 30 in patients with a bmi>35 kg/m2 (severely obese). non‐weight related pre‐operative demographics were similar between groups with the exception of an increased frequency of cryptogenic cirrhosis among the obese and severely obese patients. intra‐operative transfusion requirements were greater for the severely obese group (16.2±3.5 units versus 9.1±0.8 units for the non‐obese, p=0.0004), though not when normalized to body weight (0.14±0.03 units/kg versus 0.13±0.01 units/kg, p>0.05). post‐operatively, severely obese patients had a higher rate of wound infection (20 versus 4%, p=0.0001) and death attributed to multisystem organ failure (15 versus 2%, p=0.0001), although overall mortality prior to discharge and total complications were not different between groups. actual 1‐yr graft survival showed a negative trend in the severely obese group (67 versus 81% for non‐obese, p=0.07), but both 3‐yr graft survival and patient survival were similar to non‐obese patients (p=0.12 and 0.17, respectively by the cox–mantel test). liver transplantation in severely obese patients is associated with wound infection and early death from multisystem organ failure, but has similar long‐term outcomes when compared to non‐obese controls.
@background on a weakness of the tu-deng function and its repair after the improvement by courtois and meier of the algebraic attacks on stream ciphers and the introduction of the related notion of algebraic immunity, several constructions of infinite classes of boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity have been proposed. all of them gave functions whose algebraic degrees are high enough for resisting the berlekamp-massey attack and the recent ronjom-helleseth attack, but whose nonlinearities either achieve the worst possible value (given by lobanov's bound) or are slightly superior to it. hence, these functions do not allow resistance to fast correlation attacks. moreover, they do not behave well with respect to fast algebraic attacks. in this paper, we study an infinite class of functions which achieve an optimum algebraic immunity. we prove that they have an optimum algebraic degree and a much better nonlinearity than all the previously obtained infinite classes of functions. we check that, at least for small values of the number of variables, the functions of this class have in fact a very good nonlinearity and also a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks.
@background increased commuting to school time reduces sleep duration in adolescents introduction driven largely by international declines in rates of walking and bicycling to school and the noted health benefits of physical activity for children, research on children's active commuting to school has expanded rapidly during the past 5 years. we summarize research on predictors and health consequences of active commuting to school and outline and evaluate programs specific to children's walking and bicycling to school. methods literature on children's active commuting to school published before june 2007 was compiled by searching pubmed, psycinfo, and the national transportation library databases; conducting internet searches on program-based activities; and reviewing relevant transportation journals published during the last 4 years. results children who walk or bicycle to school have higher daily levels of physical activity and better cardiovascular fitness than do children who do not actively commute to school. a wide range of predictors of children's active commuting behaviors was identified, including demographic factors, individual and family factors, school factors (including the immediate area surrounding schools), and social and physical environmental factors. safe routes to school and the walking school bus are 2 public health efforts that promote walking and bicycling to school. although evaluations of these programs are limited, evidence exists that these activities are viewed positively by key stakeholders and have positive effects on children's active commuting to school. conclusion future efforts to promote walking and bicycling to school will be facilitated by building on current research, combining the strengths of scientific rigor with the predesign and postdesign provided by intervention activities, and disseminating results broadly and rapidly.

@background linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (leader program for 2008). abstract the cfr (chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance) gene encodes a 23s rrna methyltransferase that confers resistance to linezolid. detection of linezolid resistance was evaluated in the first cfr-carrying human hospital isolate of linezolid and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (designated mrsa cm-05) by dilution and diffusion methods (including etest). the presence of cfr was investigated in isolates of staphylococci colonizing the patient's household contacts and clinical isolates recovered from patients in the same unit where mrsa cm-05 was isolated. additionally, 68 chloramphenicol-resistant colombian mrsa isolates recovered from hospitals between 2001 and 2004 were screened for the presence of the cfr gene. in addition to erm(b), the erm(a) gene was also detected in cm-05. the isolate belonged to sequence type 5 and carried staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec type i. we were unable to detect the cfr gene in any of the human staphylococci screened (either clinical or colonizing isolates). agar and broth dilution methods detected linezolid resistance in cm-05. however, the etest and disk diffusion methods failed to detect resistance after 24 h of incubation. oxazolidinone resistance mediated by the cfr gene is rare, and acquisition by a human isolate appears to be a recent event in colombia. the detection of cfr-mediated linezolid resistance might be compromised by the use of the disk diffusion or etest method.
@method an agent-based occupancy simulator for building performance simulation: building occupancy is an important basic factor in building energy simulation but it is hard to represent due to its temporal and spatial stochastic nature. this paper presents a novel approach for building occupancy simulation based on the markov chain. in this study, occupancy is handled as the straightforward result of occupant movement processes which occur among the spaces inside and outside a building. by using the markov chain method to simulate this stochastic movement process, the model can generate the location for each occupant and the zone-level occupancy for the whole building. there is no explicit or implicit constraint to the number of occupants and the number of zones in the model while maintaining a simple and clear set of input parameters. from the case study of an office building, it can be seen that the model can produce realistic occupancy variations in the office building for a typical workday with key statistical properties of occupancy such as the time of morning arrival and night departure, lunch time, periods of intermediate walking-around, etc. due to simplicity, accuracy and unrestraint, this model is sufficient and practical to simulate occupancy for building energy simulations and stochastic analysis of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) systems.
@background 1,8-cineole, a trpm8 agonist, is a novel natural antagonist of human trpa1 camphor is a naturally occurring compound that is used as a major active ingredient of balms and liniments supplied as topical analgesics. despite its long history of common medical use, the underlying molecular mechanism of camphor action is not understood. capsaicin and menthol, two other topically applied agents widely used for similar purposes, are known to excite and desensitize sensory nerves by acting on two members of transient receptor potential (trp) channel superfamily: heat-sensitive trp vanilloid subtype 1 (trpv1) and cold-sensitive trp channel m8, respectively. camphor has recently been shown to activate trpv3, and here we show that camphor also activates heterologously expressed trpv1, requiring higher concentrations than capsaicin. activation was enhanced by phospholipase c-coupled receptor stimulation mimicking inflamed conditions. similar camphor-activated trpv1-like currents were observed in isolated rat drg neurons and were strongly potentiated after activation of protein kinase c with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. camphor activation of rat trpv1 was mediated by distinct channel regions from capsaicin, as indicated by camphor activation in the presence of the competitive inhibitor capsazepine and in a capsaicin-insensitive point mutant. camphor did not activate the capsaicin-insensitive chicken trpv1. trpv1 desensitization is believed to contribute to the analgesic actions of capsaicin. we found that, although camphor activates trpv1 less effectively, camphor application desensitized trpv1 more rapidly and completely than capsaicin. conversely, trpv3 current sensitized after repeated camphor applications, which is inconsistent with the analgesic role of camphor. we also found that camphor inhibited several other related trp channels, including ankyrin-repeat trp 1 (trpa1). the camphor-induced desensitization of trpv1 and block of trpa1 may underlie the analgesic effects of camphor.
@method high-throughput sequencing of human immunoglobulin variable regions with subtype identification background in the context of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), current findings suggest that the mucosal barrier is the major site of viral selection, transforming the complex inoculum to a small, homogeneous founder virus population. we analyzed hiv-1 transmission in relation to viral and host characteristics within the zurich primary hiv-1 infection study.   methods clonal hiv-1 envelope sequences (on average 16 clones/patient) were isolated from the first available plasma samples during the early phase of infection from 145 patients with primary hiv-1 infection. phylogenetic and tropism analyses were performed. differences of viral diversities were investigated in association with several parameters potentially influencing hiv-1 transmission, eg, concomitant sexually transmitted infections (stis) and mode of transmission.   results median viral diversity within env c2-v3-c3 region was 0.39% (range 0.04%-3.23%). viral diversity did not correlate with viral load, but it was slightly correlated with the duration of infection. neither transmission mode, gender, nor sti predicted transmission of more heterogeneous founder virus populations that were found in 16 of 145 patients (11%; diversity >1%). only 2 patients (1.4%) were assuredly infected with cxcr4-tropic hiv-1 within a r5/x4-tropic--mixed population, as revealed and confirmed using several genotypic prediction algorithms and phenotypic assays.   conclusions our findings suggest that transmission of multiple hiv-1 variants might be a complex process that is not dependent on mucosal factors alone. cxcr4-tropic viruses can be sexually transmitted in rare instances, but their clinical relevance remains to be determined.
@background mri findings reveal three different types of tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex background patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and drug-resistant epilepsy may be considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. this demands the unambiguous demonstration of the epileptogenicity of one of the tubers.   objective to test whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables differentiation of epileptogenic tubers from inert ones.   methods in 4 patients with clear unifocal interictal spike activity, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were performed. apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated in the identified epileptogenic tuber and compared withthose in nonepileptogenic tubers and regions of normal-appearing cortex.   results a significant increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient was found in the epileptogenic tubers. furthermore, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nonepileptogenic tubers was significantly higher than the trace apparent diffusion coefficient of regions of normal-appearing cortex.   conclusion diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be of clinical importance for the identification of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis and intractable epilepsy.
@result positive feedback-loop of telomerase reverse transcriptase and 15-lipoxygenase-2 promotes pulmonary hypertension telomere and telomerase alterations have been reported in mood disorders. however, the role of telomerase in depression remains unclear. here we show that chronic mild stress (cms) led to a significant decrease in telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) level and telomerase activity in the hippocampus. treatment with antidepressant fluoxetine reversed the cms-induced tert and telomerase activity changes. inhibiting telomerase by systemic administration (100 mg · kg−1 · d−1, i.p., for 14 d), intrahippocampal microinjection (0.7 μmol, 2 μl), or infusion (using an osmotic minipump, 0.134 μg/μl, 0.25 μl/h) of 3′-azido-deoxythymidine (azt) resulted in depression-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. in contrast, overexpressing telomerase by intrahippocampal infusion of recombinant adenovirus vector expressing mouse tert (ad-mtert-gfp) led to neurogenesis upregulation, produced antidepressant-like behaviors, and prevented the cms-induced behavioral modifications. disrupting neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by x-irradiation (15 gy) of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus abolished the antidepressant-like effect of ad-mtert-gfp. additionally, azt had no effect on dna polymerase activity and did not cause cell damage in vitro and in vivo. microinjection of azt into the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle (0.7 μmol, 2 μl) inhibited local neurogenesis but had no behavioral effect. these results suggest that hippocampal telomerase is involved in the modulation of depression-related behaviors, possibly by regulating adult neurogenesis.
@background intervertebral disc herniation in adolescents. study design. the authors examined a case series of patients under the age of 18 years treated for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. objectives. to evaluate postoperative and long-term results of surgery in patients younger than 18 years. summary of background data. there are only a few series, with controversial results, available on the surgical treatment of disc herniation in growing patients. methods. between 1975 and 1991, a consecutive series of 129 patients 9–18 years of age (average age, 16.2 years) underwent surgery for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. low back pain associated with leg pain was the main clinical symptom in 106 subjects (82%), back pain in 17 (13%), and leg pain in 6 (5%). results. short-term results were excellent or good for 123 cases (95%), with complete pain relief in 97 (75%) and moderate but incomplete relief in 26 (20%). a total of 98 (76%) long-term responses obtained at a mean follow-up of 12.4 years revealed excellent outcomes in 40% of the cases, good in 47%, and poor in 13%. ten patients (10%) underwent reintervention after 9 years on average (2 fusions and 8 re-explorations for herniated disc). conclusions. results have confirmed a tendency for outcomes to deteriorate between the short-term and long-term follow-up in young patients treated by discectomy: this tendency and the rate of reintervention (10%) confirmed the need for long-term follow-up of children and adolescents treated for disc herniation.
@method optimization of molecular approaches to genogroup neisseria meningitidis carriage isolates and implications for monitoring the impact of new serogroup b vaccines background in 1999, meningococcal serogroup c conjugate (mcc) vaccines were introduced in the united kingdom for those under 19 years of age. the impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred.   methods multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping.   results a reduction in serogroup c carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (st)-11 complex serogroup c meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression.   conclusions the impact of vaccination with mcc vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group c meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. the high impact on the carriage of st-11 complex serogroup c could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. high vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups.
@method search tree unification: paradigm for process-based logic programs the notion that computation = controlled deduction was first proposed by pay hayes [19] and more recently by bibel [2] and vaughn-pratt [31]. a similar thesis that database systems should be regarded as consisting of a relational component, which defines the logic of the data, and a control component, which stores and retrieves it, has been successfully argued by codd [10]. hewitt's argument [20] for the programming language planner, though generally regarded as an argument against logic, can also be regarded as an argument for the thesis that algorithms be regarded as consisting of both logic and control components. in this paper we shall explore some of the useful consequences of that thesis.
@background perfused hearts from type 2 diabetic (db/db) mice show metabolic responsiveness to insulin. the metabolic phenotype of hearts has been investigated using rodent models of type 2 diabetes which exhibit obesity and insulin resistance: db/db and ob/ob mice, and zucker fatty and zdf rats. in general, cardiac fatty acid (fa) utilization is enhanced in type 2 diabetic hearts, with increased rates of fa oxidation (db/db, ob/ob and zdf models) and increased fa esterification into cellular triacylglycerols (db/db hearts). hearts from db/db and ob/ob mice and zdf rat hearts all have elevated levels of myocardial triacylglycerols, consistent with enhanced fa utilization. a number of mechanisms may be responsible for enhanced fa utilization in type 2 diabetic hearts: (i) increased fa uptake into cardiac myocytes and into mitochondria; (ii) altered mitochondrial function, with up-regulation of uncoupling proteins; and (iii) stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. enhanced cardiac fa utilization in rodent type 2 diabetic models is associated with reduced cardiac contractile function, perhaps as a consequence of lipotoxicity and/or reduced cardiac efficiency. similar results have been obtained with human type 2 diabetic hearts, suggesting that pharmacological interventions that can reduce cardiac fa utilization may have beneficial effects on contractile function.
@background biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass. abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
@background performance analysis of data retrieval in wireless sensor networks we consider the use of energy harvesters, in place of conventional batteries with fixed energy storage, for point-to-point wireless communications. in addition to the challenge of transmitting in a channel with time selective fading, energy harvesters provide a perpetual but unreliable energy source. in this paper, we consider the problem of energy allocation over a finite horizon, taking into account channel conditions and energy sources that are time varying, so as to maximize the throughput. two types of side information (si) on the channel conditions and harvested energy are assumed to be available: causal si (of the past and present slots) or full si (of the past, present and future slots). we obtain structural results for the optimal energy allocation, via the use of dynamic programming and convex optimization techniques. in particular, if unlimited energy can be stored in the battery with harvested energy and the full si is available, we prove the optimality of a water-filling energy allocation solution where the so-called water levels follow a staircase function.
@background the impact of resistance training on swimming performance: a systematic review abstract dragunas, aj, dickey, jp, and nolte, vw. the effect of drag suit training on 50 m freestyle performance. j strength cond res 26(4): 989–994, 2012—little research has evaluated the effects of drag suit training in swimming; these effects need to be explored further to optimize their use in training. for this 5-week training study, 18 subjects were divided evenly into 2 groups: control group and drag suit–trained group. both groups performed weekly training routines that included 3 sprint sets. these sprint sets were performed by both the groups; however, the drag suit training group wore the drag suit, and the control group wore their typical training attire. we evaluated the swimmers' 50-m performance using a test set of six 50-m sprints on a 10-minute interval before and after the training program. the test set was performed twice (on 2 different days) where the swimmers were tested once in the drag suit and once in their regular training attire; the order of testing was randomized. final time, stroke rate, and distance per stroke were collected. we observed that the drag suit–trained group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in distance per stoke while wearing the drag suit and the control group showed a significant increase in stroke rate and decrease in distance per stroke (in both suits). it is suggested to include some amounts of drag suit training in periods where swimming volume may decrease. sets that are short in distance and performed at high intensity with sufficient rest to allow swimmers to maintain high stroke integrity should help athletes maintain techniques. we suggest incorporating the drag suit into the training regimen and should be considered a valuable resistive training device for swimming.
@method automatic categorization of announcements on the australian stock exchange statistical approaches to processing natural language text have become dominant in recent years. this foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (nlp) to appear. the book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building nlp tools. it provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. the book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications.
@method predicting coral bleaching hotspots: the role of regional variability in thermal stress and potential adaptation rates [1] we present the met office hadley centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (sst) data set, hadisst1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (nmat) data set, hadmat1. hadisst1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (gisst) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of sst and sea ice concentration on a 1° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. the companion hadmat1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on nmat of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. hadisst1 and hadmat1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. the sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. ssts near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between sst and sea ice concentration. hadisst1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional sst well, containing sst fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in gisst. hadmat1 is more consistent with sst and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous nmat data sets.
@method serum uric acid is associated with high blood pressure in pediatric hemodialysis patients achieving dry weight during hemodialysis (hd) while minimizing symptoms is critical for optimizing patient outcome by preventing chronic fluid overload, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy. dry weight changes frequently in children because of growth and development and waxing and waning of appetite. we have previously shown non-invasive hematocrit monitoring (nivm) helps to decrease intradialytic symptoms, while still achieving target dry weights in children receiving chronic hd. in the current study, we prospectively evaluated an nivm-guided ultrafiltration (uf) management algorithm to determine target dry weight in nine pediatric patients (mean age 16.6±2.8 years, mean weight 41.6±11.1 kg). use of nivm could potentially lead to overly aggressive uf with increased interdialytic symptoms, post treatment thirst, and interdialytic weight gain (idwg). to evaluate the effectiveness of our nivm uf algorithm, we studied the effect of three different nivm-guided uf models (100%, 90%, and 80% uf models) on intradialytic and interdialytic symptoms, pre-/post-treatment blood pressure (bp), and percentage idwg. to assess interdialytic symptoms, patients completed two questionnaires, one for each day between treatments. no statistically significant difference was seen between the three uf models with respect to intradialytic or interdialytic symptoms, pre-/post-hd bp, or percentage idwg. only one of nine patients received non-acei chronic antihypertensive medication, yet all patients had pre- and post-hd bp <95th percentile for age and height. the current study suggests that routine determination of target dry weight using nivm and aiming for 100% uf helps to achieve the target dry weight, reduces both the risk of chronic fluid overload and the need for antihypertensive medication, and does not lead to increased intra- or interdialytic symptomatology in pediatric patients treated with chronic hd.
@background effect of exogenous lysine on the expression of early cephamycin c biosynthetic genes and antibiotic production in nocardia lactamdurans ma4213 abstractl-lysine is known to stimulate production of β-lactam antibiotics bystreptomyces clavuligerus via provision of the lysine breakdown product,l-α-aminoadipic acid, which is a limiting precursor. previous investigations utilized levels of 10–20 mml-lysine as an addition to chemically-defined media resulting in 50–100% improvement in antibiotic production. we were surprised to note that as the concentration was further increased, the organism responded by producing even higher titers of antibiotics. the optimum concentration of 100 mml-lysine yielded an approximate 500% increase in production with only minor effects on growth.dl- andd-lysine also exerted enhancements suggesting the presence of a lysine racemase or some other route fromd-lysine tol-α-aminoadipate in this organism;d-lysine was considerably less potent thandl- orl-lysine.
@background biological effects of prolonged exposure to elf electromagnetic fields in rats: iii. 50 hz electromagnetic fields. we studied the effects of an acute (45 min) exposure to a 60 hz magnetic field on sodium-dependent, high-affinity choline uptake in the brain of the rat. decreases in uptake were observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus after the animals were exposed to a magnetic field at flux densities > or = 0.75 mt. these effects of the magnetic field were blocked by pretreating the animals with the narcotic antagonist naltrexone, but not by the peripheral opioid antagonist, naloxone methiodide. these data indicate that the magnetic-field-induced decreases in high-affinity choline uptake in the rat brain were mediated by endogenous opioids in the central nervous systems.
@background generation of a chinese hamster ovary cell line producing recombinant human glucocerebrosidase the purpose of this review is to describe the current status and to highlight several emerging trends in the manufacture of recombinant therapeutic proteins in cultivated mammalian cells, focusing on chinese hamster ovary cells as the major production host. over the past 25 years, specific and volumetric productivities for recombinant cell lines have increased about 20-fold as the result of improvements in media and bioprocess design. future yield increases are expected to come from further developments in gene delivery and genetic selection for more efficient recovery of high-producing cell lines and in high-throughput cultivation systems to simplify medium design and bioprocess development. other emerging trends in protein manufacturing that are discussed include the use of disposal bioreactors and transient gene expression. we specifically highlight current research in our own laboratories.
@result sex and menstrual cycle effects on chronic oral cocaine self-administration in rhesus monkeys: effects of a nondrug alternative reward substantive evidence indicates that there are sex differences in the reinforcing effects of drugs, and gonadal steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, likely contribute to these differences. among females, subjective effects of drugs differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase. the purpose of the present study was to compare oral self-administration of phencyclidine (pcp) in female rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta) across different phases of the menstrual cycle. since the 28-day menstrual cycle of non-human primates is similar to that of humans, this model could provide important evidence supporting the implication that changes in the levels of gonadal hormones across menstrual phase can alter a drug's reinforcing effects. oral self-administration of several concentrations of pcp (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml) was examined in three sexually mature female monkeys during 3-h experimental sessions. menstrual cycle phase was determined by onset of menses and verified by examining vaginal cytology. pcp self-administration was greater during the luteal phase at the 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml concentrations, which is normally characterized by high levels of progesterone and moderate levels of estrogen, than during the follicular phase, when levels of estrogen are increasing and progesterone levels are low. when examined within each phase, numbers of pcp deliveries were highest during the mid-luteal phase, compared to the early and mid-follicular phases. no differences in self-administration were observed between early and mid-follicular phases, but a significant difference in pcp deliveries was found between mid- and late luteal phases at the lowest concentration of pcp tested. the results from this study suggest that pcp's reinforcing effects in female monkeys differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase.
@background evaluation of factors affecting recovery period in lower lip hypoesthesia after sagittal split ramus osteotomy in mandibular prognathism patients. purpose the purpose of this study was to compare objectively, the recovery of hypoestheia of the lower lip following orthognathic surgery using different procedures (sagittal split ramus osteotomy [ssro]) and intra-oral vertical ramus osteotomy (ivro)) and fixation methods (monocortical plate fixation and bi-cortical plate fixation). hypoesthesia was evaluated using the trigeminal somatosensory-evoked potential (tsep).   patients and methods the subjects consisted of 174 patients (348 sides) with mandibular prognathism with or without asymmetry, who underwent mandibular ramus osteotomies using different fixation types. the patients were divided into 4 groups. the oam group consisted of 128 sides who had ssro using the obwegeser method with mono-cortical absorbable plate fixation, the odtm group consisted of 84 sides who had the obwegeser-dal pont method with mono-cortical titanium plate fixation, the otb group consisted of 32 sides who had the obwegeser method with bi-cortical titanium plate fixation and the vo group consisted of 104 sides who underwent ivro according to the bell method without fixation. trigeminal nerve hypoestheia at the region of the lower lip was assessed bilaterally by the tsep method. an electroencephalograph recording system (neuropack sigma; nion koden corp., tokyo, japan) was used to analyze the potentials. each patient was evaluated pre-operatively and then post-operatively at 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 year.   results the mean measurable period and standard deviation of tsep of the lower lip in the oam group was 5.2 +/- 9.9 weeks, 10.9 +/- 13.1 weeks in the odtm group, 7.8 +/- 4.5 weeks in the otb group, and 2.5 +/- 6.3 weeks in the vo group. there were significant differences between the oam and odtm groups (p < .0001), the odtm and otb groups (p = .0001), the otb and vo groups (p = .0221), the oam and vo groups (p < .0001), and the odtm and vo groups (p < .0001).   conclusion this study proved using objective measurements that the recovery period from hypoesthesia of the lower lip following orthognathic surgery was dependent on the surgical procedure. recovery in lower lip hypoesthesia after ivro was significantly earlier than ssro.
@background the role of information search in seeking alternative treatment for back pain: a qualitative analysis this research used the somewhat new methodology of convergent interviews to develop a conceptual framework about relationship constructs in an internet environment. more generally, this article describes and illustrates the processes and the strengths of convergent interviewing to investigate under‐researched areas, and compares it with alternative qualitative techniques like in‐depth interviews, case research and focus groups. the illustration involves interviews conducted with marketing managers and business consultants from ten service companies, about internet and relationship marketing. it is argued that convergent interviewing is more appropriate than some other qualitative methods to investigate under‐researched areas where there are few experts because it provides a way of quickly converging on key issues in the area, an efficient mechanism for data analysis after each interview, and a way of deciding when to stop collecting data. convergent interviews could become another useful qualitative research method to explore new issues about emerging marketing phenomena.
@background global biogeography and local adaptation of streptomyces understanding how microbial genotypes are arrayed in space is crucial for identifying local factors that may influence the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. in this study we investigated variation in 16s rdna sequences and rep-pcr fingerprints of streptomyces stains isolated from prairie soil among three locations and four soil depths. substantial variation in streptomyces otu (operational taxonomic unit) and box-pcr fingerprint diversity was found among locations within a limited spatial area (1 m2). further, phylogenetic lineages at each location were distinct. however, there was little variation in genetic diversity among isolates from different soil depths and similar phylogenetic lineages were found at each depth. some clones were found at a localized scale while other clones had a relatively widespread distribution. there was poor correspondence between 16s rdna groupings and rep-pcr fingerprint groupings. the finding of distinct phylogenetic lineages and the variation in spatial distribution of clones suggests that selection pressures may vary over the soil landscape.
@method the contribution of rcts to quality management and their feasibility in practice background surgical investigations and interventions account for large health care utilisation and costs, but the scientific evidence for most procedures is still limited.   objectives degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine are variously described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease (which we regarded as one entity) and may be associated with back pain and associated leg symptoms, instability, spinal stenosis and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis. the objective of this review was to assess current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of surgical interventions for degenerative lumbar spondylosis.   search strategy we searched central, medline, pubmed, spine and issls abstracts, with citation tracking from the retrieved articles. we also corresponded with experts. all data found up to 31 march 2004 are included.   selection criteria randomised (rcts) or quasi-randomised trials of surgical treatment of lumbar spondylosis.   data collection and analysis two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers. additional information was sought from the authors if necessary.   main results thirty-one published rcts of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified. the trials varied in quality: only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization, blinding and independent assessment of outcome. most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome. more of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability, but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes. there was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years. seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions. two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results. one showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy, while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme. eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate (though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work), but did not improve clinical outcomes, while there is other evidence that it may be associated with higher complication rates. three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion. preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results. preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions.   authors' conclusions limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice. surgeons should be encouraged to perform further rcts in this field.
@background activation of cardiac fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 causes left ventricular hypertrophy. chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with ckd. elevated levels of fgf23 have been linked to greater risks of lvh and mortality in patients with ckd, but whether these risks represent causal effects of fgf23 is unknown. here, we report that elevated fgf23 levels are independently associated with lvh in a large, racially diverse ckd cohort. fgf23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via fgf receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-nfat signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for fgf23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. intramyocardial or intravenous injection of fgf23 in wild-type mice resulted in lvh, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated fgf23 levels and lvh. in an established animal model of ckd, treatment with an fgf-receptor blocker attenuated lvh, although no change in blood pressure was observed. these results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for fgf23 in the pathogenesis of lvh and suggest that chronically elevated fgf23 levels contribute directly to high rates of lvh and mortality in individuals with ckd.
@background the role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
@background pharmacokinetics of intravenous n-acetylcysteine in men at rest and during exercise the production of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle is linked with muscle fatigue. this study investigated whether the antioxidant compound n-acetylcysteine (nac) augments time to fatigue during prolonged, submaximal cycling exercise. seven men completed a double-blind, crossover study, receiving nac or placebo before and during cycling exercise, comprising 45 min at 70% of peak oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) and then to fatigue at 90% vo2 peak. nac was intravenously infused at 125 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 15 min and then 25 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 20 min before and throughout exercise, which was continued until fatigue. arterialized venous blood was analyzed for nac concentration, hematology, and plasma electrolytes. nac induced no serious adverse reactions and did not affect hematology, acid-base status, or plasma electrolytes. time to fatigue was reproducible in preliminary trials (coefficient of variation 7.4 +/- 1.2%) and was not augmented by nac (nac 14.6 +/- 4.5 min; control 12.8 +/- 5.4 min). however, time to fatigue during nac trials was correlated with vo2 peak (r = 0.78; p < 0.05), suggesting that nac effects on performance may be dependent on training status. the rise in plasma k+ concentration at fatigue was attenuated by nac (p < 0.05). the ratio of rise in k+ concentration to work and the percentage change in time to fatigue tended to be inversely related (r = -0.71; p < 0.07). further research is required to clarify a possible training status-dependent effect of nac on muscle performance and k+ regulation.
@background a general scenario of hox gene inventory variation among major sarcopterygian lineages hox genes code for transcription factors that play a major role in the development of all animal phyla. in invertebrates these genes usually occur as tightly linked cluster, with a few exceptions where the clusters have been dissolved. only in vertebrates multiple clusters have been demonstrated which arose by duplication from a single ancestral cluster. this history of hox cluster duplications, in particular during the early elaboration of the vertebrate body plan, is still poorly understood. in this paper we report the results of a pcr survey on genomic dna of the pacific hagfish eptatretus stoutii. hagfishes are one of two clades of recent jawless fishes that are an offshoot of the early radiation of jawless vertebrates. our data provide evidence for at least 33 distinct hox genes in the hagfish genome, which is most compatible with the hypothesis of multiple hox clusters. the largest number, seven, of distinct homeobox fragments could be assigned to paralog group 9, which could imply that the hagfish has more than four clusters. quartet mapping reveals that within each paralog group the hagfish sequences are statistically more closely related to gnathostome hox genes than with either amphioxus or lamprey genes. these results support two assumptions about the history of hox genes: (1) the association of hagfish homeobox sequences with gnathostome sequences suggests that at least one hox cluster duplication event happened in the stem of vertebrates, i.e., prior to the most recent common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates.

@background dystrophins and daps are expressed in adipose tissue and are regulated by adipogenesis and extracellular matrix. we investigated the involvement of caveolin‐1 and the cytoskeletal proteins, actin and vimentin, in the adipogenesis of bovine intramuscular preadipocyte (bip) cells. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that levels of caveolin‐1 and actin gradually increased during adipose conversion in bip cells, whereas a slight decrease was observed for vimentin. we found that part of the vimentin was clearly distributed to caveolin‐1‐enriched membrane fractions in bip cells, but actin was not. during adipogenesis of bip cells, treatment with the tubulin depolymerizer, nocodazole, significantly increased intracellular triglyceride accumulation compared to non‐treated cells. immunocytochemical analysis showed that actin microfilaments were significantly disrupted in nocodazole‐treated cells. also, a decrease in the localization of vimentin in caveolin‐1‐enriched fractions and a failure of vimentin to co‐immunoisolate with caveolin‐1 were observed in nocodazole‐treated cells. these results suggest that a rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins has a role in the intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets during adipogenesis of bip cells.
@background the novel ugt1a9 intronic i399 polymorphism appears as a predictor of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin glucuronidation levels in the liver the human udp-glucuronosyltransferase, ugt1a9, catalyses glucuronidations of various endobiotics and xenobiotics. in the present study, all exons, exon-intron junctions, and the 5'-flanking region (-273 bp) of the ugt1a9 gene in a japanese subject were sequenced. one base insertion of thymidine in a promoter region of the ugt1a9 gene resulting in a(t)10at was identified compared to the reference sequence of af297093 (a(t)9at). the allele was termed ugt1a9*22. a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method was developed to genotype the allele. the allele frequencies of the mutation in 87 japanese, 50 caucasian and 50 african-american subjects were 60%, 39% and 44%, respectively. the significance of the polymorphism was investigated by the construction of luciferase reporter plasmids containing 170 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the gene transfected into human hepatoma hepg2 cells. the luciferase activity of the promoter construct containing the a(t)10at sequence was 2.6-fold higher than that of the construct containing the a(t)9at sequence. in conclusion, the mutant allele with one base insertion in the promoter region of the ugt1a9 gene would alter the level of enzyme expression and the metabolism of those drugs that are substrates of ugt1a9.
@background synergistic apoptosis induction by proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors is dependent on protein synthesis the targeted degradation of key regulatory proteins is an essential element of cell cycle control. the proteasome plays a central role in the degradation of such proteins and has therefore become an important therapeutic target for diseases involving cell proliferation, notably cancer. this review summarizes numerous studies demonstrating that proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis and sensitizes cancer cells to traditional tumoricidal agents both in vitro and in vivo. the potent and selective proteasome inhibitor, ps-341, is particularly promising from a therapeutic perspective, and it is the only such inhibitor that has progressed to clinical trials. preliminary data indicate that the drug is well tolerated by patients with cancer, and further trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of proteasome inhibition in hematologic and solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapeutics.
@background swarm algorithms with chaotic jumps applied to noisy optimization problems particle swarm optimization has become a common heuristic technique in the optimization community, with many researchers exploring the concepts, issues, and applications of the algorithm. in spite of this attention, there has as yet been no standard definition representing exactly what is involved in modern implementations of the technique. a standard is defined here which is designed to be a straightforward extension of the original algorithm while taking into account more recent developments that can be expected to improve performance on standard measures. this standard algorithm is intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent pso to the wider optimization community
@result predictors of recurrence during long-term treatment of bipolar i and ii disorders. a 4 year prospective naturalistic study. backgroundfew studies of the time to remission and first relapse in severe bipolar disorder have been based on epidemiologically defined samples or have examined patient characteristics and time-varying indicators of medication use simultaneously. using a cohort from the suffolk county mental health project, we describe these temporal patterns and their relationships with childhood, illness, and treatment characteristics.methoda multi-facility cohort of 123 first-admission inpatients with dsm-iv bipolar disorder with psychotic features was followed for 4 years. dates of the first complete remission (lasting at least 2 months), subsequent relapses, and use of antimanic (am),antipsychotic (ap), and antidepressant (ad) medications were recorded. childhood and illness characteristics were ascertained at baseline using standard instruments.resultsby the 4-year point, 83.7% had achieved a full remission, with 42.3% remitting within 3 months, 63.4% within 6 months, and 74.8% within 1 year. overall, younger age of onset, history of childhood psychopathology, and higher brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) anxiety/depression scores were significantly associated with longer time to remission. discontinuing am, ap and ad (compared to never using) and taking ap and ad (compared to never using) were significantly associated with remission in the multivariate analysis. of the 103 participants with complete remission, 61.2% suffered a relapse; 24.3 % relapsed within 6 months of remission, and 35.9% within a year. overall, 32.5% of the 123 participants had a single episode followed by full remission. childhood internalizing-type problems, higher bprs anxiety/depression and hamilton depression scores, and an admission episode not involving mania, but not patterns of medication use, were associated with shorter time to relapse.conclusionby 4-year follow-up, the majority of severely ill bipolar patients had remitted from their initial episode, but more than half subsequently relapsed. illness characteristics, especially depressive symptoms, and medication treatment were associated with the early course, although medication use after remission was not associated with relapse.
@background tgfβ isoforms and receptors mrna expression in breast tumours: prognostic value and clinical implications background genome-wide measures of gene expression can identify patterns of gene activity that subclassify tumours and might provide a better means than is currently available for individual risk assessment in patients with lymph-node-negative breast cancer.   methods we analysed, with affymetrix human u133a genechips, the expression of 22000 transcripts from total rna of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic treatment.   findings in a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors (er) and 16 genes for er-negative patients. this signature showed 93% sensitivity and 48% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. the gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5.67 [95% ci 2.59-12.4]), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5.55 [2.46-12.5]). the 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9.60 [2.28-40.5]), 87 postmenopausal patients (4.04 [1.57-10.4]), and 79 patients with tumours of 10-20 mm (14.1 [3.34-59.2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of prognosis is especially difficult.   interpretation the identified signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients at high risk of distant recurrence. the ability to identify patients who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent confirmation, allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less aggressive therapeutic options.
@method divergent muscle functional and architectural responses to two successive high intensity resistance exercise sessions in competitive weightlifters and resistance trained adults abstract‘explosive’ muscle strength or contractile rate of force development (rfd) is a term to describe the ability to rapidly develop muscular force, and can be measured as the slope of the torque–time curve obtained during isometric conditions. previously, conflicting results have been reported regarding the relationship between contractile rfd and various physiological parameters. one reason for this discrepancy may be that rfd in various time intervals from the onset of contraction is affected by different physiological parameters. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between voluntary contractile rfd in time intervals of 0–10, 0–20,..., 0–250 ms from the onset of contraction and two main parameters: (1) voluntary maximal muscle strength and (2) electrically evoked muscle twitch contractile properties. the main finding was that voluntary rfd became increasingly more dependent on mvc and less dependent on muscle twitch contractile properties as time from the onset of contraction increased. at time intervals later than 90 ms from the onset of contraction maximal muscle strength could account for 52–81% of the variance in voluntary rfd. in the very early time interval (<40 ms from the onset of contraction) voluntary rfd was moderately correlated to the twitch contractile properties of the muscle and was to a less extent related to mvc. the present results suggest that explosive movements with different time spans are influenced by different physiological parameters. this may have important practical implications when designing resistance training programs for specific sports.
@method impaired evoked and resting-state brain oscillations in patients with liver cirrhosis as revealed by magnetoencephalography☆☆☆ objective hepatic encephalopathy (he) is characterized by neuropsychological and motor deficits. the present study tested the hypothesis that worsening of motor and sensory symptoms of he results from a common basic deficit in the cerebral oscillatory processing within the human motor and visual system.   methods we investigated in 32 patients with liver cirrhosis and he grades 0-2 critical flicker frequency (cff) and cortico-muscular (m1-emg) coherence as a measure of coupling between the surface emgs of hand muscles and primary motor cortex (m1) activity recorded non-invasively with magnetoencephalography (meg) during forearm elevation.   results patients with he-grade 2 developed excessive m1-emg coherence at low frequencies. in contrast, maximum m1-emg coherence in patients with no he showed frequency and amplitude in the physiological range. cff was continuously reduced with worsening grades of he. correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between the frequency of m1-emg coherence and cff.   conclusions taken together, we demonstrate that increased grades of he lead to a pathological m1-emg drive which is reduced in frequency. these effects are correlated with an impaired perception of oscillatory visual stimuli.   significance the results suggest that pathological oscillatory neural processing in different human cerebral systems may represent a basic mechanism for the clinical manifestation of he.
@background blue light activates the plasma membrane h+‐atpase by phosphorylation of the c‐terminus in stomatal guard cells but is it an elephant? in the old tale, several blind men are taken to an elephant. in turn, each is asked to examine and identify the mystery object. one blind man examines a leg and claims it to be a tree, another, examining the trunk, claims it to be a snake, and yet another, feeling a tusk, claims it to be a smooth rock. the pattern continues: each describes a component, none identifies the gestalt. there are a wealth of blue-light responses in higher plants. it is clear that many are biochemically, physiologically, or genetically independent, and others are linked. the mechanism by which a photon of blue light is converted into a biochemical signal and transduced into a biological response is under investigation for several of these responses. in many cases, investigators have successfully defined one or more components of the signaling mechanism. taken together, the identified components have the potentia1 to define an entire signal transduction mechanism; receptor, g-protein, diacylglycerol, inositol triphosphate, calcium, calmodulin, several kinases, ion channels, and so forth. however, direct demonstration of a11 the components has not been achieved in any one system. indeed, in some cases specific carriers are known to be absent. further, the locations of the respective carriers differ in accordance with the location of the specific response (fig. l). perhaps the mechanisms responsible for transducing the blue-light signals are best represented by a herd of elephants. signal transduction paradigms are well established. however, recent data suggest that plants may have several nove1 signal carriers (deng et al., 1992), and it is not certain that the paradigms will be transferable to plants. the majority of studies of signal carriers for blue-light responses in higher plants make use of standard biochemical tools: direct identification based on biochemical properties or antibody crossreactivity, or indirect identification based on inhibitor/activator studies. these biochemical activities are correlated with the respective blue-light response by the photobiological activity (fluence response and/or time course), physical location, or involvement with the response as demonstrated by activator/inhibitor studies. the biochemical approach has recently been joined by a vigorous genetic approach. there are four blue-light responses in higher plants cur' supported in part by the national science foundation and the
@method chiral field theories from conifolds abstract we discuss some aspects of the physics of branes in the presence of orientifolds and the corresponding world-volume gauge dynamics. we show that at strong coupling orientifolds sometimes turn into bound states of orientifolds and branes, and give a world-sheet argument for the flip of the sign of an orientifold plane split into two disconnected parts by an ns5-brane. we also describe the moduli space of vacua of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups, and analyze a set of four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories with chiral matter content using branes.
@background the responsive approach: an integrated socially-sustainable technically-optimal decision model a fundamental requirement for effectively monitoring and operating transportation facilities is reliable, accurate data on traffic flow. the current state of the practice is to use networks of point detectors to gather information on traffic flow at fixed points on the roadway network. traffic monitoring based on wireless location technology (wlt) offers an opportunity to expand the size of the transportation network being monitored at a lower cost than with point detection. in wlt-based monitoring, the locations of individual wireless devices are sampled anonymously. by tracking a series of positions for devices in vehicles, it is theoretically possible to estimate the average travel speed on a road. although the concept of wlt-based monitoring is attractive, results have been mixed. field tests have been successful at locating vehicle positions but have not been able to generate traffic information of the quality or reliability required for most applications. this research explored how wlt-based monitoring could be improved by rigorously examining the problem from a system design perspective. the evaluation focused on two measures of effectiveness: (1) the availability of speed estimates and (2) the accuracy of speed estimates. the performance of wlt-based monitoring systems was evaluated through a combination of controlled testing on simple networks and case studies on simulated real-world networks. significant main effects and interactions were evaluated in a systematic manner using a test bed that combined microscopic traffic simulation and a model of a wlt-based monitoring system. the results revealed several important issues to be considered when designing and implementing a wlt-based monitoring system. the selection of parameters such as the number of vehicles tracked and frequency between readings needs to be tailored to handle localized traffic and geometric conditions. the results showed that well-designed monitoring systems could produce accurate results although there were some situations where performance could be improved. guidelines for the design and use of wlt-based systems were generated, and future avenues to improve system performance were noted.
@result an empirical analysis of autobiographical memory specificity subtypes in brief emotion-focused and client-centered treatments of depression previous research on depressed and suicidal patients and those with posttraumatic stress disorder has shown that patients' memory for the past is overgeneral (i.e., patients retrieve generic summaries of past events rather than specific events). this study investigated whether autobiographical memory could be affected by psychological treatment. recovered depressed patients were randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual or treatment designed to reduce risk of relapse. whereas control patients showed no change in specificity of memories recalled in response to cue words, the treatment group showed a significantly reduced number of generic memories. although such a memory deficit may arise from long-standing tendencies to encode and retrieve events generically, such a style is open to modification.
@result increased parental history of bipolar disorder in the united states: association with early age of onset objective: to compare the prevalence rates of mental disorders among children of parents with bipolar disorder and of parents with no mental disorders. method: seventeen studies, meeting specific selection criteria, were included in the metaanalyses. risks for mental disorders among children were estimated by aggregating raw data from the selected studies. results: results indicate that in comparison with children of parents with no mental disorders, children of parents with bipolar disorder are 2.7 times more likely to develop any mental disorder and 4.0 times more likely to develop an affective disorder. the metaanalyses indicate that during childhood and adolescence, the risks for any mental disorder and for affective disorders in children are consistently but moderately related to having a parent who suffers from bipolar disorder. conclusions: risk factors that could account for the psychopathology observed in children of bipolar parents are explored.
@result gait asymmetry in patients with parkinson’s disease and elderly fallers: when does the bilateral coordination of gait require attention? cognitive function and the performance of a secondary, dual task may affect certain aspects of gait, but the relationships between cognitive function and gait are not well understood. to better understand the motor control of gait and the relationship between cognitive function and gait, we studied cognitive function and the effects of different types of dual tasking on the gait of patients with parkinson's disease (pd) and controls, contrasting measures of gait automaticity and rhythmicity with other features. patients with idiopathic pd (n = 30; mean age 71.8 year) with moderate disease severity (hoehn and yahr stage 2–3) were compared to age and gender‐matched healthy controls (n = 28). memory and executive function were also assessed. in both groups, gait speed decreased in response to dual tasking, in a parallel fashion. for the pd group only, gait variability increased compared to usual walking. executive function was significantly worse in the pd group, while memory was not different in the two groups. executive function measures were significantly correlated with gait variability during dual tasking, but not during usual walking. these findings demonstrate that regulation of gait variability and rhythmicity is apparently an automatic process that does not demand attention in healthy adults. in patients with pd, however, this ability becomes attention‐demanding and worsens when subjects perform secondary tasks. moreover, the associations between executive function and gait variability suggest that a decline in executive function in pd may exacerbate the effects of dual tasking on gait, potentially increasing fall risk.
@background familial melanoma: a meta-analysis and estimates of attributable fraction to assess whether screening people at high risk of malignant melanoma would be effective in reducing the mortality from the disease data from 400 case-control pairs in a study of cutaneous malignant melanoma conducted in western australia during 1980-1 were used to predict the risk of melanoma in the remaining 111 pairs. all variables previously shown to be associated with a decrease or increase in the incidence of melanoma were considered for inclusion in a single conditional logistic regression model of the incidence of melanoma in the randomly chosen subset of 400 case-control pairs. five of these variables--number of raised naevi on the arms, arrival in australia before 10 years of age, history of non-melanocytic skin cancer, time spent outdoors in summer from the age of 10 to 24, and family history of melanoma--provided good discrimination between patients and controls in this sample and the 111 other case-control pairs. among the 222 subjects in these other case-control pairs a group defined as being at high risk of melanoma by a risk score derived from these five variables contained 60 (54%) of the patients with melanoma but only 18 (16%) of the controls. these data suggest that in western australia more than half of all new patients with melanoma arise in an identifiable subpopulation constituting less than one fifth of the whole population. identifying this subpopulation and screening it regularly for cutaneous malignant melanoma could be cost effective in reducing mortality from this disease.

@background chianina beef tenderness investigated through integrated omics. within a population of charolais young bulls, two extreme groups of longissimus thoracis muscle samples, classified according to warner-bratzler shear force (wbsf) of 55 degrees c grilled meat, were analyzed by 2d-electrophoresis. muscle analyses were performed on 4 bulls of the "tender" group (wbsf=27.7+/-4.8 n) and 4 bulls of the "tough" group (wbsf=41.2+/-6.1 n), at 3 post-mortem times: d0, samples taken within 10 min post-mortem; d5 and d21, samples kept at 4 degrees c under vacuum during 5 and 21 days. proteins of muscle samples were separated in two fractions based on protein solubility in tris buffer: "soluble" and "insoluble". proteins of both fractions were separated by 2d-electrophoresis. evolution of spots during the 3 post-mortem times was analyzed by hierarchical classification (hca). three clusters of proteins presenting similar evolution profiles provided accurate classification of post-mortem times and showed the translocation of some chaperone proteins and glycolytic enzymes from the soluble fraction to the insoluble fraction between d0 and d5. cellular structure dismantlement and proteolysis was observed at d21. effect of group ("tender" vs "tough") on spot intensities was tested by anova. at d0, higher quantity of proteins of the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria was found in the tender group suggesting a more extensive degradation of mitochondria that may be related to the apoptotic process.
@background the ret receptor regulates sensory neuron dendrite growth and integrin mediated adhesion alternative splicing of the drosophila gene dscam results in up to 38,016 different receptor isoforms proposed to interact by isoform-specific homophilic binding. we report that dscam controls cell-intrinsic aspects of dendrite guidance in all four classes of dendrite arborization (da) neurons. loss of dscam in single neurons causes a strong increase in self-crossing. restriction of dendritic fields of neighboring class iii neurons appeared intact in mutant neurons, suggesting that dendritic self-avoidance, but not heteroneuronal tiling, may depend on dscam. overexpression of the same dscam isoforms in two da neurons with overlapping dendritic fields forced a spatial segregation of the two fields, supporting the model that dendritic branches of da neurons use isoform-specific homophilic interactions to ensure minimal overlap. homophilic binding of the highly diverse extracellular domains of dscam may therefore limit the use of the same "core" repulsion mechanism to cell-intrinsic interactions without interfering with heteroneuronal interactions.
@background evolutionary plasticity of segmentation clock networks background the pattern of somites is traced out by a mechanism involving oscillating gene expression at the tail end of the embryo. in zebrafish, two linked oscillating genes, her1 and her7, coding for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins, are especially implicated in genesis of the oscillations, while notch signaling appears necessary for synchronization of adjacent cells.   results i show by mathematical simulation that direct autorepression of her1 and her7 by their own protein products provides a mechanism for the intracellular oscillator. this mechanism operates robustly even when one allows for the fact that gene regulation is an essentially noisy (stochastic) process. the predicted period is close to the observed period (30 min) and is dictated primarily by the transcriptional delay, the time taken to make an mrna molecule. through its coupling to her1/her7 expression, notch signaling can keep the rapid oscillations in adjacent cells synchronized. when the coupling parameters are varied, however, the model system can switch to oscillations of a much longer period, resembling that of the mouse or chick somitogenesis oscillator and governed by the delays in the notch pathway. such notch-mediated synchronous oscillations are predicted even in the absence of direct her1/her7 autoregulation, through operation of the standard notch signaling pathway that is usually assumed simply to give lateral inhibition.   conclusions direct autorepression of a gene by its own product can generate oscillations, with a period determined by the transcriptional and translational delays. simple as they are, such systems show surprising behaviors. to understand them, unaided intuition is not enough: we need mathematics.
@background foreground segmentation of live videos using locally competing 1svms this paper examines the problem of moving object detection. more precisely, it addresses the difficult scenarios where background scene textures in the video might change over time. in this paper, we formulate the problem mathematically as minimizing a constrained risk functional motivated from the large margin principle. it is a generalization of the one class support vector machines (1-svms) [17] to accommodate spatial interactions, which is further incorporated into an online learning framework to track temporal changes. as a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. we also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. by exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (gpus) to facilitate realtime analysis. our empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach works in realtime (over 80 frames per second) and at the same time performs competitively against state-of-the-art offline and quasi-realtime methods.
@background computational linguistics harnessing the statistical power of neural networks to perform language understanding and symbolic reasoning is difficult, when it requires executing efficient discrete operations against a large knowledge-base. in this work, we introduce a neural symbolic machine, which contains (a) a neural “programmer”, i.e., a sequence-to-sequence model that maps language utterances to programs and utilizes a key-variable memory to handle compositionality (b) a symbolic “computer”, i.e., a lisp interpreter that performs program execution, and helps find good programs by pruning the search space. we apply reinforce to directly optimize the task reward of this structured prediction problem. to train with weak supervision and improve the stability of reinforce, we augment it with an iterative maximum-likelihood training process. nsm outperforms the state-of-the-art on the webquestionssp dataset when trained from question-answer pairs only, without requiring any feature engineering or domain-specific knowledge.
@background kinetics of inhibition of soluble peripheral nerve esterases by pmsf: a non-stable compound that potentiates the organophosphorus-induced delayed neurotoxicity type b carboxylesterases (acetylcholinesterases, neuropathy target esterase, serine peptidases), catalyse the hydrolysis of carboxyl-ester substrates by formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent cleavage and release of the acyl group. organophosphorus compounds, carbamates, and others exert their mechanism of neurotoxicity by permanent covalent organophosphorylation or carbamylation at the catalytic site of carboxylesterases. classical kinetic studies converted the exponential kinetic equation to a logarithmic equation for graphic analysis. this process, however, does not allow analysing complex situations. in this paper, kinetic model equations are reviewed and strategies developed for the following cases: (a) single enzyme, with classical linear equation; (b) multi-enzymatic system—discriminating several inhibitor-sensitive and inhibitor-resistant components; (c) ‘ongoing inhibition’—high sensitive enzymes can be significantly inhibited during the substrate reaction time, the model equations need a correction; (d) spontaneous reactivation (de-phosphorylation)—one or several components can be simultaneously inhibited and spontaneously reactivated; (e) spontaneous reactivation from starting time with the enzyme being partly or totally inhibited; (f) aging—single enzyme can be inhibited, spontaneously reactivated and dealkylating reaction (‘aging’) simultaneously occurs; and (g) aging and spontaneous reactivation from starting time with the enzyme being partly or totally inhibited. analysis of data using the suggested equations allows the deduction of inhibition kinetic constants and the proportions of each of the enzymatic components. strategies for practical application of the models and for obtaining consistent kinetic parameters, using multi-steps approaches or 3d fitting, are presented.
@background morphological and molecular basis of cytoplasmic dilation and swelling in cortical migrating neurons during neural development, the cytoskeleton of newborn neurons undergoes extensive and dynamic remodelling to facilitate the sequential steps of neurogenesis, cell migration and terminal differentiation. it is clear from studying the mechanisms that precipitate these functions that different configurations of the cytoskeleton prefigure the correct execution of each step and define cohorts of proteins the functions of which are indispensable for the control of neuronal migration but not terminal differentiation. these combinatorial protein functions are also predetermined by regulated gene expression and the precise subcellular localisation of their protein products. here, we expand on this view in the context of recent data on how the cytoskeleton is regulated during the maturation of cortical neurons within the developing brain.
@background density estimation of the endangered udzungwa red colobus (procolobus gordonorum) and other arboreal primates in the udzungwa mountains using systematic distance sampling abstract hunting and habitat degradation are universal threats to primates across the tropics, thus deciphering the relative impact of threats on population relative abundance is critical to predicting extinction risk and providing conservation recommendations. we studied diurnal primates over a period of nearly 6 years in the udzungwa mountains of tanzania, a site of global importance for primate conservation. we assessed how population relative abundance of five species (of which two are endemic and iucn-endangered) differed between two forest blocks that are similar in size and habitat types but contrast strongly in protection level, and how abundance changed during 2004–2009. we also measured habitat and disturbance parameters and, in the unprotected forest, evaluated hunting practices. we found significant differences in primates’ abundance between protected and unprotected forests, with the greater contrast being the lower abundance of colobine monkeys (udzungwa red colobus and angolan colobus) in the unprotected forest. at this site moreover, colobines declined to near-extinction over the study period. in contrast, two cercopithecines (sanje mangabey and sykes’ monkey) showed slightly higher abundance in the unprotected forest and did not decline significantly. we argue that escalating hunting in the unprotected forest has specifically impacted the canopy-dwelling colobus monkeys, although habitat degradation may also have reduced their abundance. in contrast, cercopithecines did not seem affected by the current hunting, and their greater ecological adaptability may explain the relatively higher abundance in the unprotected forest. we provide recommendations towards the long-term protection of the area.
@method accurate camera calibration from multi-view stereo and bundle adjustment we show that surface reconstruction from oriented points can be cast as a spatial poisson problem. this poisson formulation considers all the points at once, without resorting to heuristic spatial partitioning or blending, and is therefore highly resilient to data noise. unlike radial basis function schemes, our poisson approach allows a hierarchy of locally supported basis functions, and therefore the solution reduces to a well conditioned sparse linear system. we describe a spatially adaptive multiscale algorithm whose time and space complexities are proportional to the size of the reconstructed model. experimenting with publicly available scan data, we demonstrate reconstruction of surfaces with greater detail than previously achievable.
@method redefining the differences in gene content between yersinia pestis and yersinia pseudotuberculosis using large-scale comparative genomics the blast programs are widely used tools for searching protein and dna databases for sequence similarities. for protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the blast programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. a new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped blast program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. in addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by blast into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. the resulting position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped blast, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. psi-blast is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the brct superfamily.
@method effect of pain and mild cognitive impairment on mobility background the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (mci) and mobility limitations is high among older adults. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between mci status and both performance-based and self-report measures of mobility in community-dwelling older adults.   methods an analysis was conducted on baseline data from the boston rehabilitative impairment study in the elderly study, a cohort study of 430 primary care patients aged 65 or older. neuropsychological tests identified participants with mci and further subclassified those with impairment in memory domains (amci), nonmemory domains (namci), and multiple domains (mdmci). linear regression models were used to assess the association between mci status and mobility performance in the habitual gait speed, figure of 8 walk, short physical performance battery, and self-reported late life function and disability instrument's basic lower extremity and advanced lower extremity function scales.   results participants had a mean age of 76.6 years, and 42% were characterized with mci. participants with mci performed significantly worse than participants without mci (no-mci) on all performance and self-report measures (p < .01). all mci subtypes performed significantly worse than no-mci on all mobility measures (p < .05) except for amci versus no-mci on the figure of 8 walk (p = .054) and basic lower extremity (p = .11). moreover, compared with amci, mdmci manifested worse performance on the figure of 8 walk and short physical performance battery, and namci manifested worse performance on short physical performance battery and basic lower extremity.   conclusions among older community-dwelling primary care patients, performance on a broad range of mobility measures was worse among those with mci, appearing poorest among those with nonmemory mci.
@result long term effects of residential no(x) exposure on total and cause-specific mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction in a swedish cohort. background: the association of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes with air pollution exposures has been well established in the literature. the number of studies examining chronic exposures in cohorts is growing, with more recent studies conducted among women finding risk estimates of greater magnitude. questions remain regarding sex differences in the relationship of chronic particulate matter (pm) exposures with mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. objectives: in this study we explored these associations in the all-male health professionals follow-up study prospective cohort. methods: the same spatiotemporal exposure estimation models, similar outcomes, and biennially updated covariates were used as those previously applied in the female nurses’ health study cohort. results: among 17,545 men residing in the northeastern and midwestern united states, there were 2,813 deaths, including 746 cases of fatal coronary heart disease (chd). an interquartile range change (4 µg/m3) in average exposure to pm ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter in the 12 previous months was not associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (hr) = 0.94; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.87–1.00] or fatal chd (hr = 0.99; 95% ci, 0.87–1.13) in fully adjusted models. findings were similar for separate models of exposure to pm ≤ 10 µm in diameter and pm between 2.5 and 10 µm in diameter and for copollutant models. conclusions: among this cohort of men with high socioeconomic status living in the midwestern and northeastern united states, the results did not support an association of chronic pm exposures with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in models with time-varying covariates. whether these findings suggest sex differences in susceptibility or the protective impact of healthier lifestyles and higher socioeconomic status requires additional investigation.
@method muscle pump-dependent self-perfusion mechanism in legs in normal subjects and patients with heart failure. summaryxamoterol acts as aβ1-adrenoceptor agonist at low sympathetic activity and as an antagonist at high activity. although its long-term efficacy has been proven in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, it remains unclear which effect, agonism or antagonism, accounts for its long-term activity.to clarify the effect of xamoterol on cardiac sympathetic activity in daily life, 24-h r-r interval histograms were obtained during administration of xamoterol 100 mg b. d. for 1 week to 10 patients with mild to moderate heart failure. eight normal subjects were also studied as controls. to examine the relation between the effect of xamoterol and sympathetic activity, plasma noradrenaline (na) levels were measured under 5 graded conditions simulating daily living.xamoterol administration significantly decreased the standard deviation of the r-r interval, both in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects. the mean r-r interval, however, was increased in patients with heart failure, relative to normal subjects.in both groups, the r-r interval histograms had two peaks, i. e. a short daytime peak and a long night-time peak. xamoterol decreased the median of the night-time peak without changing the daytime peak in normal subjects. in contrast, it increased the median of the daytime peak without producing a significant change in the nighttime peak in patients with heart failure. levels of plasma na were significantly higher in patients than in normal subjects under all conditions.thus, in normal subjects xamoterol predominantly increased the slower heart rate at night with only a minor effect on the higher heart rate in the daytime, whereas it predominantly attenuated the daytime tachycardia induced by sympathetic stimulation in patients with heart failure.it is concluded that xamoterol tends overall to act as aβ-adrenoceptor antagonist during the day, especially in the daytime in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. its antagonist rather than its agonist effect may account for the long-term efficacy of xamoterol in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.
@result enzymatic analysis of recombinant japanese encephalitis virus ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease with fluorogenic model peptide substrates the ns3 (dengue virus non-structural protein 3) serine protease of dengue virus is an essential component for virus maturation, thus representing an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed at the inhibition of polyprotein processing. in the present study, we have investigated determinants of substrate specificity of the dengue virus ns3 protease by using internally quenched fluorogenic peptides containing abz (o-aminobenzoic acid; synonymous to anthranilic acid) and 3-nitrotyrosine (ny) representing both native and chimaeric polyprotein cleavage site sequences. by using this combinatorial approach, we were able to describe the substrate preferences and determinants of specificity for the dengue virus ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease. kinetic parameters (kcat/k(m)) for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates with systematic truncations at the prime and non-prime side revealed a length preference for peptides spanning the p4-p3' residues, and the peptide abz-rrrrsagny-amide based on the dengue virus capsid protein processing site was discovered as a novel and efficient substrate of the ns3 protease (kcat/k(m)=11087 m(-1) x s(-1)). thus, while having confirmed the exclusive preference of the ns3 protease for basic residues at the p1 and p2 positions, we have also shown that the presence of basic amino acids at the p3 and p4 positions is a major specificity-determining feature of the dengue virus ns3 protease. investigation of the substrate peptide abz-kkqragvlny-amide based on the ns2b/ns3 polyprotein cleavage site demonstrated an unexpected high degree of cleavage efficiency. chimaeric peptides with combinations of prime and non-prime sequences spanning the p4-p4' positions of all five native polyprotein cleavage sites revealed a preponderant effect of non-prime side residues on the k(m) values, whereas variations at the prime side sequences had higher impact on kcat.

@background effects of images with different levels of familiarity on eeg behavioral researches have shown that the visual function can be partly restored by phosphene-based prosthetic vision for the non-congenital blinds. however, the early visual processing mechanisms of phosphene object recognition is still unclear. this paper aimed to investigate the electro-neurophysiology underlying the phosphene face and non-face recognition. the modulations of latency and amplitude of n170 component in the event-related potential (erp) were analyzed. our preliminary results showed that (1) both normal and phosphene face stimuli could elicit prominent n170; nevertheless, phosphene stimuli caused notable latency delay and amplitude suppression on n170 compared with normal stimuli and (2) under phosphene non-face stimuli, a slight but significant latency delay occurred compared with normal stimuli, while amplitude suppression was not observed. therefore, it was suggested that (1) phosphene perception caused a disruption of the early visual processing for non-canonical images of objects, which was more profound in phosphene face processing; (2) the face-specific processing was reserved under prosthetic vision and (3) holistic processing was the major stage in early visual processing of phosphene face recognition, while part-based processing was attenuated due to the loss of the details.
@result distinct regions control transcriptional activation of the alpha1(vi) collagen promoter in different tissues of transgenic mice the expression of type vi collagen has been studied in mouse tissues. by northern blotting, the mrna for the alpha 1 (vi) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10.5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. the messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. in 2-month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat were among the most active producers of alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in situ hybridization first identified mrna for alpha 1 (vi) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10.5-day embryos in various locations, including serosae, branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. in several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. this staining pattern was different from that for collagen type i, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. the pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in addition, the results confirmed that type vi collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. this was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. the data show that type vi collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue.
@background degradation of mixtures of phenolic compounds by arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.

@background ischemia modified albumin: does it change during pneumoperitoneum in robotic prostatectomies? background and objective the aim of this study was to compare the effects of propofol and n-acetyl cysteine (nac) on tourniquet-induced ischaemia–reperfusion injury by determining malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin, lactate, blood gas and haemodynamic levels in arthroscopic knee surgery. methods sixty asa i or ii patients were randomized into three groups. intrathecal anaesthesia was administered using 0.5% heavy bupivacaine in all patients. in group p, propofol was administered in a 0.2 mg kg−1 bolus, followed by infusion at a rate of 2 mg kg−1 h−1; in group nac, nac was administered as an infusion at a rate of 5 mg kg−1 h−1, and, in group c (the control group), an equal volume of isotonic saline was administered to patients until 30 min after reperfusion. blood samplings were obtained immediately before intrathecal anaesthesia (t1), 1 min before tourniquet release (t2), 5 min after tourniquet release (t3) and 30 min after tourniquet release (t4). results plasma malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin and lactate levels increased significantly in group c at t3 and t4 compared with the baseline values. plasma concentrations of malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin and lactate in groups p and nac were significantly lower than those in group c at t3 and t4. in blood gas analyses, ph, hco3 and base excess were found to be significantly lower at t3 and t4 compared with t1 and t2 in group c. comparisons between groups p and nac revealed no significant differences. conclusion small-dose infusions of both propofol and nac appear to provide similar protection against ischaemia–reperfusion injury in arthroscopic knee surgery.
@background altered growth and root tip morphology in pisum sativum l. in response to altered expression of a gene expressed in border cells recently, ishikawa and evans (1995) focused attention on the immediately postmitotic growth zone of plant roots and indicated its importance in root growth in response to interna1 and externa1 factors. this previously unrecognized region of the root, intercalated between the apical meristem and the zone of rapid cell elongation, was originally discovered as the result of a morphometric analysis of the breadthlength ratios of cells along the length of the maize root (baluska et al., 1990). the analysis indicated that as cells are displaced away from the root apex, their growth is adjusted in such a way that, in the immediate postmitotic region, approximately isodiametric (cuboidal) cellular shapes are obtained. thus, the term "postmitotic 'isodiametric' growth" (or pig) was coined for this region. in the cortex of maize primary roots the pig zone was about 450 pm; in cultured tomato roots its length was about 380 pm. the length of this region thus represents about 5.5% of the entire growth zone. subsequent studies confirmed the uniqueness of the cells located in the pig zone, not only from a morphometrical point of view, but also on account of their specific cytological and physiological properties (barlow et al., 1991; baluska et al., l992,1994,1996a, 1996c; ishikawa and evans, 1992, 1993, 1995). from a cellular point of view, the root tip has (a) a zone of cell division, a zone of more-or-less isotropic cell growth in which the cells both elongate and increase in width at similar rates; and (b) a zone of elongation in which cell growth is distinctly anisotropic and the rate of elongation is much greater than in the pig zone. in cell-based terminology, therefore, the term "zone of cell elongation" should be reserved for root cells that grow in this strictly polar fashion. significantly, our morphometric studies at the cellular leve1 showed that an abrupt decline of cellular widening coincided precisely with a prominent increase in the rate of cell lengthening, and this occurred at the base of the pig region (baluska et al., 1990, 1994; barlow et al., 1991). this occurrence provided the first hint that the newly formed postmitotic cells of the root may undergo some kind of preparatory phase wherein they adjust or reorganize their growth from the formerly slow, mitotic mode of growth to a rapid mode of elongation. rapid cell elongation in roots is based in part on an extensive uptake of solutes coupled with the formation of a prominent vacuolar compartment. these events accelerate cell expansion, which is channeled with the aid of specific alignments of both the cortical microtubules (cmts) in the cytoplasm and the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall, into strictly anisotropic cell enlargement. a significant reorganization of the metabolic machinery is required to achieve this new mode of cell growth. for example, cells of maize root apices increase their volume approximately 10-fold in the 13 h during which they migrate through the elongation region, whereas in the meristem cell volume may only double during this period (baluska et al., 1996~). once the rapid acceleration of cell growth has been triggered, it must be supported by a robust synthetic machinery that is obviously not yet operational in cells that are just ceasing their meristematic phase of development. if it were otherwise, root cells would commence their rapid elongation simultaneously with the termination of mitotic division. not a11 cells of the root cease to divide at the same distance from the root tip, and it was recently found that the proximal limit of the meristem fluctuates in a rhythmic manner in accordance with a programmed pattern of transverse cell division within its constituent cell files (liick et al., 1996). it is probably advantageous, therefore, for the early postmitotic root cells to enter a critica1 preparatory phase, located in a special transition zone behind the meristem, where they acquire the ability to embark on rapid elongation. moreover, some supracellular organizing process within this transition zone may ensure the simultaneous commencement of the rapid elongation phase in cells of different tissues (epidermis, cortex, stele, etc.) at a particular distance from the root tip. root-generated electric fields, for example, may be one way of defining the conditions required for a coordinated program of rapid elongation after cells have completed their preparatory phase within the transition zone. also, within this zone cells develop the necessary synthetic machinery for the biogenesis of new tonoplast and plasma membranes, cell-wall components, new enzymatic complexes, and cytoplasmic structures that support such rapid growth. aside from the basic synthetic machinery for cell growth, individual elements of the cytoskeleton can also be expected to alter their intracellular distribution from those configurations that support mitotic cell growth and division to arrangements that enable rapid cell elongation. in cells of the postmitotic transition zone, the cmts change from loosely organized transverse arrays to an exclusively transverse orientation with respect to the root axis; the latter orientation is often accompanied by the appearance of
@background mir‐204 downregulates ephb2 in aging mouse hippocampal neurons ephrin ligands and their cognate eph receptors guide axons during neural development and regulate synapse formation and neuronal plasticity in the adult. because ephrins are tethered to the plasma membrane and possess reverse signaling properties, the eph-ephrin system can function in a bidirectional, contact-mediated fashion between two opposing cells. eph receptors expressed on dendrites are activated by ephrins (on axons or on astrocytes) and regulate spine and synapse formation. they also participate in activity-induced long-term changes in synaptic strength such as long-term potentiation (ltp). when expressed on axon terminals, ephrins promote presynaptic differentiation and enhance neurotransmitter release, thereby supporting presynaptic forms of ltp. in some cases, eph receptors can simply act as ligands for ephrins without any requirement for eph receptor signaling, suggesting that the system does not always function bidirectionally.

@background patterning of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived pan-mesoderm by activin a/nodal and bmp4 signaling requires fibroblast growth factor activity. the vertebrate fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, fgf8a and fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for fgf receptors. to investigate the in vivo requirement for fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing fgf8b expression in mice. analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. we show that the loss of fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (e) 6.5. importantly, fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as fgf8b-deficient embryos at e6.5, demonstrating that signaling by fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. by contrast, during gastrulation, fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of fgf8b in mesoderm specification. we show that an increased level of fgf8a expression, which leads to fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of fgf8b. therefore, different fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. importantly, our findings implicate fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.

@method perceptual learning: 12-month-olds' discrimination of monkey faces. experience plays a crucial role for the normal development of many perceptual and cognitive functions, such as speech perception. for example, between 6 and 10 months of age, the infant's ability to discriminate among native speech sounds improves, whereas the ability to discriminate among foreign speech sounds declines. however, a recent investigation suggests that some experience with non-native languages from 9 months of age facilitates the maintenance of this ability at 12 months. nelson has suggested that the systems underlying face processing may be similarly sculpted by experience with different kinds of faces. in the current investigation, we demonstrate that, in human infants between 6 and 9 months of age, exposure to non-native faces, in this case, faces of barbary macaques (macaca sylvanus), facilitates the discrimination of monkey faces, an ability that is otherwise lost around 9 months of age. these data support, and further elucidate, the role of early experience in the development of face processing.
@method power system state estimation via feasible point pursuit state estimation (se) is an important task allowing power networks to monitor accurately the underlying system state, which is useful for security-constrained dispatch and power system control. for nonlinear ac power systems, se amounts to minimizing a weighted least-squares cost that is inherently nonconvex, thus giving rise to many local optima. as a result, estimators used extensively in practice rely on iterative optimization methods, which are destined to return only locally optimal solutions, or even fail to converge. a semidefinite programming (sdp) formulation for se has been advocated, which relies on the convex semidefinite relaxation (sdr) of the original problem and thereby renders it efficiently solvable. theoretical analysis under simplified conditions is provided to shed light on the near-optimal performance of the sdr-based se solution at polynomial complexity. the new approach is further pursued toward complementing traditional nonlinear measurements with linear synchrophasor measurements and reducing computational complexity through distributed implementations. numerical tests on the standard ieee 30- and 118-bus systems corroborate that the se algorithms outperform existing alternatives, and approach near-optimal performance.
@method do conflict resolution and recovery predict the survival of adolescents' romantic relationships? preliminary psychometric data are presented for two inventories that assess conflict in couples. the ineffective arguing inventory (iai) is a self-report measure that assesses a dysfunctional style of couple conflict resolution. the conflict resolution style inventory (crsi) has complementary self-report and partner-report versions that assess four personal conflict resolution styles for each member of the couple. subjects were both partners of 75 gay, 51 lesbian, 108 married non-parent, and 99 married parent couples. findings for each inventory are presented regarding the factor structure of items, the internal consistency of composite scores, the 1-year stability of composite scores, the relation between couple members' composite scores, and the link between composite scores and relationship satisfaction, change in satisfaction, and relationship dissolution. generally, results warrant further examination of the iai and crsi as measures of conflict for couples. all couples have to deal with conflict. further, how that conflict is managed is linked to relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (gottman, 1994; heavey, layne, & christensen, 1993; markman, renick, floyd, stanley, & clements, 1993; noller & white, 1990). to date, perhaps the most productive method for studying relationship conflict has been to code videotapes of partner conversations for small samples of couples in a laboratory setting (e.g., gottman, 1994). without denying the value of these behavioral observations--in particular, for assessing sequences of couples' interactional styles during conflict--the present study is based on the premise that self-report and partner-report methodologies are also valuable ways to study couple conflict and may complement observational methodologies. one of the major limitations of observational studies of couple conflict is that they utilize very small, nonrepresentative samples. in fact, some of the inconsistent findings in observational studies regarding the types of conflict resolution strategies that are linked to declines in relationship satisfaction over time have been attributed to biased samples (gottman, 1993). the availability of psychometrically sound self-report and partner-report measures of conflict resolution would help address this limitation by providing researchers with one method by which the link between conflict resolution and both relationship maintenance and relationship dissolution could be studied in large, representative samples. some measures of couple conflict are available, including self-report measures of couple conflict resolution patterns (e.g., the problem-solving communication scale of the marital satisfaction inventory; snyder, 1981), self-report measures of individual conflict resolution styles (e.g., the marital coping inventory, bowman, 1990), and self-report and partner-report measures of each partner's conflict resolution styles (e.g., the interpersonal communication skills inventory; boyd & roach, 1977) as well as sequences of partners' conflict resolution styles (e.g., the communication patterns questionnaire; christensen, 1988). however, no measure of couple conflict resolution could be found that was brief, was based on a coherent conceptual framework, and had comprehensively documented psychometric properties. documenting psychometric properties include validating the measure against the major relationship outcomes used in behavioral observations in this area of study--relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (gottman, 1994; gottman & krokoff, 1989; markman et al., 1993). accordingly, the purpose of this article is to present such preliminary psychometric data for two brief nonobservational measures of couple conflict. the first measure--the ineffective arguing inventory (iai)--assesses how the couple handles conflict, whereas the second measure the conflict resolution styles inventory (crsi)--assesses each partner's individual style of handling conflict. …

@background metabolism of a fl atoxin b 1 in turkey liver microsomes : the relative roles of cytochromes p 450 1 a 5 and 3 a 37 cytochrome p450s (p450) play an important role in the formation of carcinogenic and mutagenic electrophilic intermediates from a wide range of xenobiotics, including naturally occurring dietary compounds. the pathogenesis of hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic action of the mycotoxin aflatoxin b(1) (afb(1)) involves initial bioactivation by p450s to a reactive and electrophilic intermediate exo-aflatoxin b(1)-8,9-epoxide (exo-afbo). poultry, especially turkeys are extremely sensitive to afb(1), a condition due, in part, to efficient epoxidation by p450 1a and 3a enzymes. we previously reported the discovery of p450 1a5 from turkey liver, which like its human homologue, 1a2, bioactivated afb(1) to exo-afbo and aflatoxin m(1) (afm(1)). here, we describe p450 3a37, the 3a4 homologue from turkey liver. this gene has an open reading frame (orf) of 1512 bp, and the protein is predicted to be 504 amino acids with 97% identity to chicken p450 3a37. a truncated construct of the turkey p450 3a37 gene with 11 amino acids deleted from the hydrophobic n-terminal region was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, the protein from which exhibited a co difference spectrum typical of p450s. like human p450 3a4, 3a37 biotransformed afb(1) to exo-afbo and aflatoxin q(1) (afq(1)) and possessed nifedipine oxidation activity, both of which were inhibited by the p450 3a4 inhibitor 17alpha-ethynylestradiol. oxidation of afb(1) to exo-afbo and afq(1) by p450 3a37 followed sigmoidal hill kinetics, suggestive of an allosteric interaction between the enzyme and afb(1). the hill coefficient (n) value was 1.9 for exo-afbo and 1.6 for afq(1), indicative of positive cooperativity. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for the formation of exo-afbo were 287 +/- 21 mum and 1.45 +/- 0.07 nmol/min/nmol p450, respectively, whereas those of afq(1) formation were 302 +/- 51 mum and 7.86 +/- 0.75 nmol/min/nmol p450, respectively. these data strongly suggest that p450 3a37, along with p450 1a5, plays an important role in afb(1) epoxidation in turkey liver.
@background efficient similarity search in nonmetric spaces with local constant embedding an important consideration in similarity-based retrieval of moving object trajectories is the definition of a distance function. the existing distance functions are usually sensitive to noise, shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures, errors in detection techniques, disturbance signals, and different sampling rates. cleaning data to eliminate these is not always possible. in this paper, we introduce a novel distance function, edit distance on real sequence (edr) which is robust against these data imperfections. analysis and comparison of edr with other popular distance functions, such as euclidean distance, dynamic time warping (dtw), edit distance with real penalty (erp), and longest common subsequences (lcss), indicate that edr is more robust than euclidean distance, dtw and erp, and it is on average 50% more accurate than lcss. we also develop three pruning techniques to improve the retrieval efficiency of edr and show that these techniques can be combined effectively in a search, increasing the pruning power significantly. the experimental results confirm the superior efficiency of the combined methods.
@background adaptation of bacillus subtilis to growth at low temperature: a combined transcriptomic and proteomic appraisal. the alternative sigma factor sigmab of bacillus subtilis is required for the induction of approximately 100 genes after the imposition of a whole range of stresses and energy limitation. in this study, we investigated the impact of a null mutation in sigb on the stress and starvation survival of b. subtilis. sigb mutants which failed to induce the regulon following stress displayed an at least 50- to 100-fold decrease in survival of severe heat (54 degrees c) or ethanol (9%) shock, salt (10%) stress, and acid (ph 4.3) stress, as well as freezing and desiccation, compared to the wild type. preloading cells with sigmab-dependent general stress proteins prior to growth-inhibiting stress conferred considerable protection against heat and salt. exhaustion of glucose or phosphate induced the sigmab response, but surprisingly, sigmab did not seem to be required for starvation survival. starved wild-type cells exhibited about 10-fold greater resistance to salt stress than exponentially growing cells. the data argue that the expression of sigmab-dependent genes provides nonsporulated b. subtilis cells with a nonspecific multiple stress resistance that may be relevant for stress survival in the natural ecosystem.
@method mitochondrial creatine kinase activity and phosphate shuttling are acutely regulated by exercise in human skeletal muscle the hypothesis that the aging process is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress has been investigated in human skeletal muscle. muscle biopsy samples were taken from seven old male subjects [os; 75 (range 61–86) years] and eight young male subjects [ys; 25 (22–31) years]. oxidative function was measured both in permeabilised muscle fibres and isolated mitochondria. despite matching the degree of physical activity, os had a lower training status than ys as judged from pulmonary maximal o2 consumption (v̇o2max, −36%) and handgrip strength (−20%). both maximal respiration and creatine-stimulated respiration were reduced in muscle fibres from os (−32 and −34%, respectively). in contrast, respiration in isolated mitochondria was similar in os and ys. the discrepancy might be explained by a biased harvest of "healthy" mitochondria and/or disruption of structural components during the process of isolation. cytochrome c oxidase was reduced (−40%, p<0.01), whereas ucp3 protein tended to be elevated in os (p=0.09). generation of reactive oxygen species by isolated mitochondria and measures of antioxidative defence (muscle content of glutathione, glutathione redox status, antioxidative enzymes activity) were not significantly different between os and ys. it is concluded that aging is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which appears to be unrelated to reduced physical activity. the hypothesis of increased oxidative stress in aged muscle could not be confirmed in this study.
@background wax ester synthesis is required for mycobacterium tuberculosis to enter in vitro dormancy the search for new tb drugs that rapidly and effectively sterilize the tissues and are thus able to shorten the duration of chemotherapy from the current 6 months has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the metabolism of the bacterium when in a ‘persistent’ or latent form. little is known about the condition in which the bacilli survive, although laboratory models have shown that mycobacterium tuberculosis can exist in a non‐growing, drug‐resistant state that may mimic persistence in vivo. using nutrient starvation, we have established a model in which m. tuberculosis arrests growth, decreases its respiration rate and is resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin and metronidazole. we have used microarray and proteome analysis to investigate the response of m. tuberculosis to nutrient starvation. proteome analysis of 6‐week‐starved cultures revealed the induction of several proteins. microarray analysis enabled us to monitor gene expression during adaptation to nutrient starvation and confirmed the changes seen at the protein level. this has provided evidence for slowdown of the transcription apparatus, energy metabolism, lipid biosynthesis and cell division in addition to induction of the stringent response and several other genes that may play a role in maintaining long‐term survival within the host. thus, we have generated a model with which we can search for agents active against persistent m. tuberculosis and revealed a number of potential targets expressed under these conditions.
@result hmgb1/2 can target dna for illegitimate cleavage by the rag1/2 complex v(d)j recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. however, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant v(d)j recombination. translocations involving lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving sil/scl, are cited examples of illegitimate v(d)j recombination. previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (crsss) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support v(d)j recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide v(d)j recombination signals. to understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these crsss by the rag1/2 proteins that initiate v(d)j recombination. we find that the rag proteins comparably bind all crsss tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus rss. we show that four crsss that support levels of v(d)j recombination above background levels in cell culture (lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and sil) are also cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus rss. cleavage of lmo2 and ttg-1 by the rag proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated pcr. in contrast, hox11 and scl are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these crsss in cell culture.
@background an attempt towards simultaneous biobased solvent based extraction of proteins and enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic materials from distiller's grains and solubles. ddgs and wet distillers' grains are the major co-products of the dry grind ethanol facilities. as they are mainly used as animal feed, a typical compositional analysis of the ddgs and wet distillers' grains mainly focuses on defining the feedstock's nutritional characteristics. with an increasing demand for fuel ethanol, the ddgs and wet distillers' grains are viewed as a potential bridge feedstock for ethanol production from other cellulosic biomass. the introduction of ddgs or wet distillers' grains as an additional feed to the existing dry grind plants for increased ethanol yield requires a different approach to the compositional analysis of the material. rather than focusing on its nutritional value, this new approach aims at determining more detailed chemical composition, especially on polymeric sugars such as cellulose, starch and xylan, which release fermentable sugars upon enzymatic hydrolysis. in this paper we present a detailed and complete compositional analysis procedure suggested for ddgs and wet distillers' grains, as well as the resulting compositions completed by three different research groups. polymeric sugars, crude protein, crude oil and ash contents of ddgs and wet distillers' grains were accurately and reproducibly determined by the compositional analysis procedure described in this paper.
@background evaluating college students' displayed alcohol references on facebook and twitter. objectives. underage drinking contributes to the 3 leading causes of death (unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide) among persons aged 12 to 20 years. most adverse health effects from underage drinking stem from acute intoxication resulting from binge drinking. although binge drinking, typically defined as consuming ≥5 drinks on an occasion, is a common pattern of alcohol consumption among youth, few population-based studies have focused specifically on the characteristics of underage binge drinkers and their associated health risk behaviors. methods. we analyzed data on current drinking, binge drinking, and other health risk behaviors from the 2003 national youth risk behavior survey. prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using sas and sudaan statistical software. logistic regression was used to examine the associations between different patterns of alcohol consumption and health risk behaviors. results. overall, 44.9% of high school students reported drinking alcohol during the past 30 days (28.8% binge drank and 16.1% drank alcohol but did not binge drink). although girls reported more current drinking with no binge drinking, binge-drinking rates were similar among boys and girls. binge-drinking rates increased with age and school grade. students who binge drank were more likely than both nondrinkers and current drinkers who did not binge to report poor school performance and involvement in other health risk behaviors such as riding with a driver who had been drinking, being currently sexually active, smoking cigarettes or cigars, being a victim of dating violence, attempting suicide, and using illicit drugs. a strong dose-response relationship was found between the frequency of binge drinking and the prevalence of other health risk behaviors. conclusions. binge drinking is the most common pattern of alcohol consumption among high school youth who drink alcohol and is strongly associated with a wide range of other health risk behaviors. effective intervention strategies (eg, enforcement of the minimum legal drinking age, screening and brief intervention, and increasing alcohol taxes) should be implemented to prevent underage alcohol consumption and adverse health and social consequences resulting from this behavior.
@background prospective, randomized trial examining the role of gentamycin-containing collagen sponge in the reduction of postoperative morbidity in rectal cancer patients: early results and surprising outcome at 3-year follow-up over 14 years 276 patients with rectal cancer underwent surgery; 219 who underwent low anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision were studied. there were 24 (11·0 per cent) major anastomotic leaks associated with peritonitis or a pelvic collection and 14 (6·4 per cent) minor leaks that were asymptomatic and detected by contrast enema. all major leaks occurred at an anastomotic height of less than 6cm (p = 0·08). the abdominoperineal excision rate was 9·1 per cent. major leaks were associated with failure to defunction in 11 of 62 patients and with a defunctioning colostomy in 13 of 157 (p = 0·03). of the 24 patients with major leaks seven developed peritonitis, one with a defunctioned anastomosis (p = 0·002), and three died (p = 0·02). use of the sigmoid colon led to major leakage in seven of 32 patients compared with 17 of 187 when the splenic flexure was employed (p = 0·05). there was no increase in the local recurrence rate but only nine patients with major leakage and a temporary stoma have had these closed. key technical factors incude: a clean dry pelvie cavity, pulsatile colonic blood supply, suction drainage started during closure and mobilization of ample tissue to fill the pelvic space.
@background toxoplasma gondii rhoptry kinase rop16 activates stat3 and stat6 resulting in cytokine inhibition and arginase-1-dependent growth control backgroundbrain inflammation plays a central role in multiple sclerosis (ms). dimethylfumarate (dmf), the main ingredient of an oral formulation of fumaric acid esters with proven therapeutic efficacy in psoriasis, has recently been found to ameliorate the course of relapsing-remitting ms. glial cells are the effector cells of neuroinflammation; however, little is known of the effect of dmf on microglia and astrocytes. the purpose of this study was to use an established in vitro model of brain inflammation to determine if dmf modulates the release of neurotoxic molecules from microglia and astrocytes, thus inhibiting glial inflammation.methodsprimary microglial and astrocytic cell cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of neonatal rats. the control cells were treated with lps, an accepted inducer of pro-inflammatory properties in glial cells, and the experimental groups with lps and dmf in different concentrations. after stimulation/incubation, the generation of nitric oxide (no) in the cell culture supernatants was determined by measuring nitrite accumulation in the medium using griess reagent. after 6 hours of treatment rt-pcr was used to determine transcription levels of inos, il-1β, il-6 and tnf-α mrna in microglial and astrocytic cell cultures initially treated with dmf, followed after 30 min by lps treatment. moreover, we investigated possible involvement of the erk and nrf-2 transduction pathway in microglia using western blot analysis.resultspretreatment with dmf decreased synthesis of the proinflammatory mediators inos, tnf-α, il-1β and il-6 at the rna level in activated microglia and astrocytes in vitro, associated with a decrease in erk phosphorylation in microglia.conclusionscollectively, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of dmf may be in part functionally attributable to the compound's ability to inhibit expression of multiple neuroinflammatory mediators in brain of ms patients.

@background inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding: autoradiographic localization in rat brain protein kinase c is a calcium- and phospholipid-stimulated enzyme present in high concentration in the brain. phorbol esters are potent tumor promoters that bind to specific receptors with high affinity. several lines of evidence indicate that the phorbol ester receptor is identical to protein kinase c. to determine the distribution of protein kinase c, we have localized phorbol ester receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography, using [3h]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3h]pdbu) and have performed a variety of lesions to assess the nature of the cellular elements possessing the binding sites. the [3h]pdbu binding sites in the rat brain are discretely localized and primarily associated with neurons. evidence is presented for localization to intrinsic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, terminals of the striatonigral projection, a projection to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and to dendrites of purkinje cells.
@background treatment of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome intestinal disease in cystic fibrosis (cf) mice closely mirrors aspects of obstructive syndromes in cf patients. the pathogenesis involves accumulation of mucoid debris in the crypts that fuse with intestinal content to form obstructing mucofeculant impactions. treatment involves modalities that increase the fluidity of the luminal content, such as osmotic laxatives and liquid diets. we investigated the effects of talniflumate (lomucin, genaera corporation, plymouth meeting, pa), a compound that may be beneficial to treatment of cf intestinal disease based on three mechanisms of action: mucus synthesis inhibition by blockade of the murine calcium-activated chloride channel 3 (mclca3), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of cl–/hco –3 exchanger(s) involved in intestinal nacl absorption. cohorts of cf mice were fed control diet or diets containing either talniflumate (0.4 mg/g chow) or ibuprofen (0.4 mg/g chow) for 21 days to assess survival. talniflumate significantly increased cf mouse survival from 26 to 77%, whereas ibuprofen had no effect (22% survival). oral talniflumate did not alter crypt goblet cell numbers or change intestinal expression of mclca3 but tended to decrease crypt mucoid impaction. ussing chamber studies indicated that talniflumate slightly increased the basal short-circuit current of cf intestine, but the change was not sensitive to secretagogue stimulation or bumetanide inhibition. in contrast, intracellular ph measurements of intact intestinal villous epithelium indicated that talniflumate significantly inhibited apical membrane cl–/hco –3 exchange by >50%. we conclude that oral talniflumate increases the survival of cf mice, possibly by the beneficial effects of decreasing small intestinal nacl absorption through the inhibition of apical membrane cl–/hco –3 exchanger(s).
@method non-negative spherical deconvolution (nnsd) for estimation of fiber orientation distribution function in single-/multi-shell diffusion mri we present a method for the estimation of various features of the tissue micro-architecture using the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. the considered features are designed from the displacement probability density function (pdf). the estimation is based on two steps: first the approximation of the signal by a series expansion made of gaussian-laguerre and spherical harmonics functions; followed by a projection on a finite dimensional space. besides, we propose to tackle the problem of the robustness to rician noise corrupting in-vivo acquisitions. our feature estimation is expressed as a variational minimization process leading to a variational framework which is robust to noise. this approach is very flexible regarding the number of samples and enables the computation of a large set of various features of the local tissues structure. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with results on both synthetic phantom and real mr datasets acquired in a clinical time-frame.
@result roles of the traf6 and pellino e3 ligases in myd88 and rankl signaling tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor–associated factor (traf)-6 mediates lys63-linked polyubiquitination for nf-κb activation via its n-terminal ring and zinc finger domains. here we report the crystal structures of traf6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) ubc13. the ring and zinc fingers of traf6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. interaction of traf6 with ubc13 involves direct contacts of the ring and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. unexpectedly, this region of traf6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric c-terminal traf domain. structure-based mutagenesis reveals that traf6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that traf6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length traf6. the mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.
@background demonstrating the synergy between cac and scheduling in wireless networks in this study, we approach systems from an information theoretical perspective. specifically, we propose a framework to model systems by noisy communication channels and analyze them by this framework whose elements are commonly used analysis tools in science and engineering. a noisy communication channel model is a mechanism that accepts a set of inputs and yields a set of outputs. the formal mechanisms to exploit the relationships in the proposed framework include fourier series, uniform polygons, roots of unity, special permutations and polynomials. these formal mechanisms make the framework more powerful by enabling it to connect common analysis tools provided in complex analysis and graph theory.

@method yoga as steadiness training: effects on motor variability in young adults purpose to determine the contribution of visuomotor correction to increased force fluctuations in the elbow flexor and knee extensor muscles of elderly adults.   methods young (n = 22, 23 +/- 3 yr) and elderly (n = 23, 74 +/- 7 yr) adults performed constant-force contractions at target forces of 2.5, 30, and 65% mvc. visual feedback was provided (6-8 s) and then removed (6-8 s). after removal of drift (< 0.5 hz) from the force, the standard deviation (sd) and coefficient of variation (cv) of force were calculated from vision and no-vision data.   results maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) force was 19% lower for elbow flexors and 37% lower for knee extensors in elderly adults than in young adults. overall, the cv of force was 27% greater in the vision condition compared with the no-vision condition. the cv of force for vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults at the 2.5% mvc target force and lower at 30 and 65% mvc. for the 2.5% mvc target force, the decline in cv of force from vision to no vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults. at 30 and 65% mvc, the decline was significant but similar for young and elderly adults. for elbow flexors, the change in power from vision to no vision was greater for 0- to 4-hz (reduced power) and 8- to 12-hz (increased power) frequencies for elderly adults compared with young adults.   conclusion visuomotor correction contributed to force fluctuations in large proximal muscles. the contribution was greater for healthy elderly adults at low forces. visuomotor processes thus contributed to the age-related increase in force fluctuations.
@result biomechanical analysis of defensive cutting actions during game situations: six cases in collegiate soccer competitions in many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. however, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. the aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. a laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. this provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. the test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 hz motion analysis system. root mean square (rms) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. rms velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the rms differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. in conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. the kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. this method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.
@background magma chamber evolution : an energy-constrained geochemical model incorporating the effects of concurrent eruption , recharge , variable assimilation and fractional crystallization ( ece 0 ra fc ) a conservation-of-energy equation has been derived for the spatially averaged magma temperature in a spherical pluton undergoing simultaneous crystallization and both internal (magma) and external (hydrothermal fluid) thermal convection. the model accounts for the dependence of magma viscosity on crystallinity, temperature, and bulk composition; it includes latent heat effects and the effects of different initial water concentrations in the melt and quantitatively considers the role that large volumes of circulatory hydrothermal fluids play in dissipating heat. the nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing these processes has been solved for a variety of magma compositions, initial termperatures, initial crystallinities, volume ratios of hydrothermal fluid to magma, and pluton sizes. these calculations are graphically summarized in plots of the average magma temperature versus time after emplacement. solidification times, defined as the time necessary for magma to cool from the initial emplacement temperature to the solidus temperature vary as r1,3, where r is the pluton radius. the solidification time of a pluton with a radius of 1 kilometer is 5 x 104 years; for an otherwise identical pluton with a radius of 10 kilometers, the solidification time is ∼106 years. the water content has a marked effect on the solidification time. a granodiorite pluton with a radius of 5 kilometers and either 0.5 or 4 percent (by weight) water cools in 3.3 x 105 or 5 x 104 years, respectively. convection solidification times are usually but not always less than conduction cooling times.
@background attenuation of morphine tolerance by intrathecal gabapentin is associated with suppression of morphine-evoked excitatory amino acid release in the rat spinal cord recent studies indicate that glutamate binding to n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in the spinal cord is involved in triggering the development of chronic pain however, the processes which directly underlie the increased pain remain unclear. here we report that, following peripheral nerve injury (ligation of the sciatic nerve) in the rat, there is an increase in immunoreactive labelling of non-n-methyl-d-asparatate, ampa (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate), glutamate receptors in the superficial laminae of the lumbar spinal cord ipsilateral to the ligation. the increase in ampa receptor expression peaks 14 days after nerve ligation and decreases 35 days post-ligation, corresponding to the time-course of heightened sensitivity to mechanical and thermal noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) induced by the ligation. given evidence that ampa receptors in the superficial laminae mediate fast nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord, our findings suggest that an upregulation of spinal ampa receptors contributes to hyperalgesia following peripheral nerve injury.
@background functional characterization of fusarium verticillioides cpp1, a gene encoding a putative protein phosphatase 2a catalytic subunit. yeast cells can select bud sites in either of two distinct spatial patterns. a cells and alpha cells typically bud in an axial pattern, in which both mother and daughter cells form new buds adjacent to the preceding division site. in contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. the bud3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of bud3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. the sequence of bud3 predicts a product (bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. however, immunofluorescence localization of bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. the bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. these single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. the bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (cdc3p, cdc10p, cdc11p, and cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. in addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. taken together, the data suggest that bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. as the expression and localization of bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.
@background wing phosphorylation is a major functional determinant of the lrs14‐type biofilm and motility regulator abfr1 in sulfolobus acidocaldarius in this study, the in vitro and in vivo functions of the only two identified protein phosphatases, saci-ptp and saci-pp2a, in the crenarchaeal model organism sulfolobus acidocaldarius were investigated. biochemical characterization revealed that saci-ptp is a dual-specific phosphatase (against pser/pthr and ptyr), whereas saci-pp2a exhibited specific pser/pthr activity and inhibition by okadaic acid. deletion of saci_pp2a resulted in pronounced alterations in growth, cell shape and cell size, which could be partially complemented. transcriptome analysis of the three strains (δsaci_ptp, δsaci_pp2a and the mw001 parental strain) revealed 155 genes that were differentially expressed in the deletion mutants, and showed significant changes in expression of genes encoding the archaella (archaeal motility structure), components of the respiratory chain and transcriptional regulators. phosphoproteome studies revealed 801 unique phosphoproteins in total, with an increase in identified phosphopeptides in the deletion mutants. proteins from most functional categories were affected by phosphorylation, including components of the motility system, the respiratory chain, and regulatory proteins. in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant the up-regulation at the transcript level, as well as the observed phosphorylation pattern, resembled starvation stress responses. hypermotility was also observed in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant. the results highlight the importance of protein phosphorylation in regulating essential cellular processes in the crenarchaeon s. acidocaldarius.

@background plasma homocysteine and dna damage profiles in normal and obese subjects in the pakistani population background moderate elevations in plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations are associated with atherosclerosis and hypertension. we tested the hypothesis that experimental perturbation of homocysteine levels produces resistance and conduit vessel endothelial dysfunction and that this occurs through increased oxidant stress.   methods and results oral administration of l-methionine (100 mg/kg) was used to induce moderate hyperhomocyst(e)inemia ( approximately 25 micromol/l) in healthy human subjects. endothelial function of forearm resistance vessels was assessed by use of forearm vasodilatation to brachial artery administration of the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine. conduit vessel endothelial function was assessed with flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery. forearm resistance vessel dilatation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired 7 hours after methionine (methionine, 477+/-82%; placebo, 673+/-110%; p=0.016). methionine did not alter vasodilatation to nitroprusside and verapamil. flow-mediated dilatation was significantly impaired 8 hours after methionine loading (0.3+/-2.7%) compared with placebo (8. 2+/-1.6%, p=0.01). oral administration of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (2 g) prevented methionine-induced endothelial dysfunction in both conduit and resistance vessels (p=0.03).   conclusions experimentally increasing plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations by methionine loading rapidly impairs both conduit and resistance vessel endothelial function in healthy humans. endothelial dysfunction in conduit and resistance vessels may underlie the reported associations between homocysteine and atherosclerosis and hypertension. increased oxidant stress appears to play a pathophysiological role in the deleterious endothelial effects of homocysteine.
@background the search-ification of everyday life and the mundane-ification of search web search engines have become indispensable tools for finding information online effectively. as the range of information, context and users of internet searches has grown, the relationship between the search query, search interest and user has become more tenuous. not all users are seeking the same information, even if they use the same query term. thus, the quality of search results has, at least potentially, been decreasing. search engines have begun to respond to this problem by trying to personalise search in order to deliver more relevant results to the users. a query is now evaluated in the context of a user’s search history and other data compiled into a personal profile and associated with statistical groups. this, at least, is the promise stated by the search engines themselves. this paper tries to assess the current reality of the personalisation of search results. we analyse the mechanisms of personalisation in the case of google web search by empirically testing three commonly held assumptions about what personalisation does. to do this, we developed new digital methods which are explained here. the findings suggest that google personal search does not fully provide the much-touted benefits for its search users. more likely, it seems to serve the interest of advertisers in providing more relevant audiences to them.
@background structural determinants for alternative splicing regulation of the mapt pre-mrna we have determined the sequences of isoforms of human tau protein, which differ from previously reported forms by insertions of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal region. complementary dna cloning shows that the insertions occur in combination with both three and four tandem repeats. rnaase protection assays indicate that transcripts encoding isoforms with the insertions are expressed in an adult-specific manner. transcripts encoding four tandem repeats are also expressed in an adult-specific manner, whereas mrnas encoding three tandem repeats are expressed throughout life, including in fetal brain. the levels of transcripts encoding the 29 or 58 amino acid inserts were not significantly changed in cerebral cortex from patients with alzheimer's disease. antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to these different human tau isoforms demonstrate that multiple tau protein isoforms are incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of alzheimer's disease.
@background consurf 2016: an improved methodology to estimate and visualize evolutionary conservation in macromolecules motivation a number of proteins of known three-dimensional (3d) structure exist, with yet unknown function. in light of the recent progress in structure determination methodology, this number is likely to increase rapidly. a novel method is presented here: 'rate4site', which maps the rate of evolution among homologous proteins onto the molecular surface of one of the homologues whose 3d-structure is known. functionally important regions often correspond to surface patches of slowly evolving residues.   results rate4site estimates the rate of evolution of amino acid sites using the maximum likelihood (ml) principle. the ml estimate of the rates considers the topology and branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree, as well as the underlying stochastic process. to demonstrate its potency, we study the src sh2 domain. like previously established methods, rate4site detected the sh2 peptide-binding groove. interestingly, it also detected inter-domain interactions between the sh2 domain and the rest of the src protein that other methods failed to detect.
@background parallel matrix computations using a reconfigurable pipelined optical bus we present several optical interconnection structures which support communication requirements unique to multiprocessor systems, namely, broadcasting, multicasting, simulcasting, and multiport memory access. the structures are based on guided wave time division multiplexed channels and use coincident pulse techniques to optically demultiplex individual bits at selected destinations. we describe 1-and 2-d structures which are appropriate for processor to processor interconnections and for processor to memory interconnections, respectively.
@background arpp/ankrd2, a member of the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (marps), translocates from the i-band to the nucleus after muscle injury in this study, we isolated and characterized a murine counterpart of the human arpp (harpp) gene. sequence analysis revealed that the murine arpp (marpp) gene is almost identical to the ankrd2 gene, which has recently been isolated as a mouse gene induced in stretched skeletal muscle. the marpp gene encodes a protein of 332 amino acids that contains four well-conserved ankyrin-repeat domains in the central portion of the protein. the amino acid sequence of marpp protein (marpp) is highly homologous to that of mouse cardiac-restricted ankyrin-repeat protein (carp), which is proposed to be a putative genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that marpp is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers, and that marpp is localized in both the nucleus and the sarcomeric i-band of muscle fibers, suggesting that arpp may function as a nuclear and sarcomeric protein. furthermore, marpp was also expressed in neurons of the cerebellum and cerebrum, the islets of langerhans in the pancreas, and the esophageal epithelium, suggesting that marpp may play a functional physiologic role in brain, pancreas, and esophagus as well as in type 1 muscle fibers. interestingly, although marpp was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm in neurons, its localization was restricted to nucleus in pancreas and esophagus, suggesting that intracellular localization of marpp is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. furthermore, we found that marpp- and carp-expression in skeletal muscle were markedly up-regulated after denervation. although the elevated expression level of carp was kept only for two weeks after denervation, that of arpp was kept at least for 4 weeks, suggesting that marpp and carp may play distinct functional roles in denervated skeletal muscle.
@method the inverse relation between risks and benefits: the role of affect and expertise. hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. we provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. we present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. we also provide sas and spss macros, as well as mplus and lisrel syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.
@method long-term consumption of fish oil-enriched diet impairs serotonin hypophagia in rats objective using rats we examined whether maternal intake of hydrogenated fat rich in trans fatty acids affects brain fatty acid profile, hypothalamic content of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 proteins, and the hypophagic effect of centrally administered insulin in 3-mo-old male progeny.   methods throughout pregnancy and lactation, wistar rats ate isocaloric/normolipidic diets with soybean oil (control) or soybean oil-derived hydrogenated fat (trans diet) as a fat source. upon weaning, the trans offspring continued on the trans diet (trans group) or were switched to a control diet (trans-control group).   results compared with control rats, trans rats had lower brain levels of eicosapentaenoic acid. compared with trans rats, trans-control rats had increased levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid and decreased levels of trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids. insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 levels were significantly lower (44% and 38%, respectively) in trans than in control rats. in trans-control rats, insulin receptor was 26% lower (p < 0.05), whereas insulin receptor substrate-1 was 50% lower, than in control rats. insulin decreased 24-h feeding in control (27%) and trans (38%) rats but failed to do so in trans-control rats. the latter group had increased serum glucose levels.   conclusions the data suggest that the early (intrauterine/perinatal) exposure to hydrogenated fat rich in trans fatty acids programmed the hypothalamic feeding control mechanisms. as young adults, only trans-control animals showed loss of insulin-induced hypophagia, indicating that the mismatch between early and later nutritional environments was relevant. however, the trans group also showed signs of altered appetite signaling mechanisms, suggesting that the early adaptations may have deleterious consequences later in life.
@background effects of emotion regulation difficulties on the tonic and phasic cardiac autonomic response we examined the relationship between tonic--a correlate of self-regulatory functioning--and phasic cardiac vagal activity (indexed by heart rate variability; hrv) during a selective attentional task with varying levels of load. participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on either fearful or neutral face distractors. letter strings consisted of six target letters under low load and one target letter and five nontarget letters under high load. with fearful distractors, lower tonic hrv was associated with phasic hrv suppression, suggesting an autonomic stress response under both low and high load. in contrast, higher tonic hrv was associated with phasic hrv enhancement, suggesting greater self-regulatory effort under low load and an absence of phasic hrv suppression under high load. the current research suggests that tonic cardiac vagal tone is associated with the ability to flexibly adapt autonomic responses.
@background crystal growth of high-quality protein crystals under the presence of an alternant electric field in pulse-wave mode, and a strong magnetic field with radio frequency pulses characterized by x-ray diffraction protein crystallization under a magnetic field is an interesting research topic because a magnetic field may provide a special environment to acquire improved quality protein crystals. because high-quality protein crystals are very useful in high-resolution structure determination using diffraction techniques (x-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction), research using magnetic fields in protein crystallization has attracted substantial interest; some studies have been performed in the past two decades. in this research field, the hardware is especially essential for successful studies because the environment is special and the design and utilization of the research apparatus in such an environment requires special considerations related to the magnetic field. this paper reviews the hardware for protein crystallization (including the magnet systems and the apparatus designed for use in a magnetic field) and progress in this area. future prospects in this field will also be discussed.
@result central injection of a new corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) antagonist, astressin, blocks crf- and stress-related alterations of gastric and colonic motor function. background/aims interleukin 1 beta (il-1 beta) increases the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) in the brain through prostaglandin pathways. because central crf inhibits gastric motor function, the influence and mechanism of action of intracisternal injection of il-1 beta on gastric emptying were investigated.   methods the 20-minute rate of gastric emptying of a nonnutrient test meal was assessed by the phenol red methylcellulose method 30 minutes after injection of human recombinant il-1 beta in conscious rats.   results il-1 beta injected intracisternally (0.01-1 ng) or intravenously (0.01-10 ng) dose-dependently decreased gastric emptying by 10%-82% and 0%-89%, respectively. the median effective dose (ed50) was 30-fold lower when il-1 beta was injected intracisternally (0.1 ng) than intravenously (3 ng). the inhibitory effect of intracisternal il-1 beta had a rapid onset (within 20 minutes) and was long-lasting (6 hours). indomethacin (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) completely prevented the 61% inhibition induced by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng) but had no effect on crf-induced (600 ng) 72% inhibition of gastric emptying. the intracisternal injection of the il-1 receptor antagonist (100 ng) or the crf antagonist [dphe12, [dphe12,nle21,38,c alpha meleu37]crf12-41 (20 micrograms) prevented by 100% and 52%, respectively, the inhibition of gastric emptying evoked by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng). the antagonists alone had no effect on basal gastric emptying.   conclusions il-1 beta acts in the brain to induce a long-lasting inhibition of gastric emptying; il-1 beta action is mediated through central il-1 receptors and prostaglandin- and crf-dependent mechanisms.
@method empirical study to find factors influencing e-filing adoption in india abstract. electronic government, or e‐government, increases the convenience and accessibility of government services and information to citizens. despite the benefits of e‐government – increased government accountability to citizens, greater public access to information and a more efficient, cost‐effective government – the success and acceptance of e‐government initiatives, such as online voting and licence renewal, are contingent upon citizens’ willingness to adopt this innovation. in order to develop ‘citizen‐centred’ e‐government services that provide participants with accessible, relevant information and quality services that are more expedient than traditional ‘brick and mortar’ transactions, government agencies must first understand the factors that influence citizen adoption of this innovation. this study integrates constructs from the technology acceptance model, diffusions of innovation theory and web trust models to form a parsimonious yet comprehensive model of factors that influence citizen adoption of e‐government initiatives. the study was conducted by surveying a broad diversity of citizens at a community event. the findings indicate that perceived ease of use, compatibility and trustworthiness are significant predictors of citizens’ intention to use an e‐government service. implications of this study for research and practice are presented.
@background mix-distribution modeling for overcomplete denoising de-noising with the traditional (orthogonal, maximally-decimated) wavelet transform sometimes exhibits visual artifacts; we attribute some of these—for example, gibbs phenomena in the neighborhood of discontinuities—to the lack of translation invariance of the wavelet basis. one method to suppress such artifacts, termed “cycle spinning” by coifman, is to “average out” the translation dependence. for a range of shifts, one shifts the data (right or left as the case may be), de-noises the shifted data, and then unshifts the de-noised data. doing this for each of a range of shifts, and averaging the several results so obtained, produces a reconstruction subject to far weaker gibbs phenomena than thresholding based de-noising using the traditional orthogonal wavelet transform.
@background psychiatric comorbidities in a community sample of women with fibromyalgia objective traumatic events can result in a set of symptoms including nightmares, recurrent and intrusive recollections, avoidance of thoughts or activities associated with the traumatic event, and symptoms of increased arousal such as insomnia and hypervigilance. these posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd)-like symptoms are frequently observed in persons with chronic pain syndromes. little is known about how these two phenomena interact with one another. the present study evaluated ptsd-like symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (fms) and examined the relation between ptsd-like symptoms and problems associated with fms.   design ninety-three consecutive patients underwent a comprehensive fms evaluation and completed self-report questionnaires measuring ptsd-like symptoms, disability, and psychosocial responses to their pain condition. subjects were divided in two groups based on level of self-reported ptsd-like symptoms.   results approximately 56% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of ptsd-like symptoms (ptsd+). the ptsd+ patients reported significantly greater levels of pain (p < 0.01), emotional distress (p < 0.01), life interference (p < 0.01), and disability (p < 0.01) than did the patients without clinically significant levels of ptsd-like symptoms (ptsd-). over 85% of the ptsd+ patients compared with 50% of the ptsd- patients demonstrated significant disability. based on response to the multidimensional pain inventory, a significantly smaller percentage of ptsd+ patients were classified as adaptive copers (15%) compared with the ptsd- group (48.2%).   conclusions results suggest that ptsd-like symptoms are prevalent in fms patients and may influence adaptation to this chronic illness. clinicians should assess the presence of these symptoms, as the failure to attend to them in treatment may impede successful outcomes.
@background anti-idiotypic antibodies specific to prm monoantibody prevent antibody dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection thrombocytopenia is common in patients with dengue virus (denv) infections. with a focus on understanding the possible mechanism of thrombocytopenia in denv infections we described a direct correlation between activation and depletion of platelets in patients. our data showed a sharp decrease in platelet counts at day 4 of fever in patients. the high denv genome copies in platelets correlated directly with the elevated platelet activation along with increased binding of complement factor c3 and igg on their surface at day 4. recovery in platelet count was observed on day 10 through day 6 and 8 with simultaneous decrease in platelet activation markers. further, our in vitro data supported the above observations describing a concentration-dependent increase in platelet activation by denv serotype-2. the high copy number of denv2 genome in the platelet pellet correlated directly with platelet activation, microparticle generation and clot formation. furthermore the denv2-activated platelets were phagocytosed in large numbers by the monocytes. the denv2-mediated lysis and clearance of platelets were abrogated in presence of platelet activation inhibitor, prostacyclin. these observations collectively suggest that platelet activation status is an important determinant of thrombocytopenia in dengue infections. a careful strategy of inactivation of platelets may rescue them from rapid destruction during denv infections.
@background a versatile assay for rna-binding proteins in living cells. ultraviolet (uv) irradiation can initiate complex formation between proteins and dna or rna and so can be used to study such interactions. however, crosslink formation by standard uv light sources can take up to several hours. more recently, a beam of monochromatic uv light from a laser has been used to initiate crosslinking in nano- and picosecond time intervals. as noted in an earlier tibs article 'the advantages of short pulse times and high-energy fluxes should make this a valuable technique in the future'. in this review we characterize laser-induced crosslinking and explore the applications of this method.
@method nais: neural attentive item similarity model for recommendation we present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. we describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. we give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. we experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
@method a market-based approach to recommender systems we have designed, implemented, deployed and evaluated a large-scale agent-oriented information system that recommends relevant documents to users. our recommender system is now being used across several european institutions. its two key features are a modular design capable of accomodating multiple recommendation methods, and the use of a marketplace to select and rank the best recommendations for the user. as part of our evaluation, we have extensively simulated this marketplace in order to understand its dynamics and validate its suitability for a reeommender system.
@background quantifying cfse label decay in flow cytometry data in most biological studies and processes, cell proliferation and population dynamics play an essential role. due to this ubiquity, a multitude of mathematical models has been developed to describe these processes. while the simplest models only consider the size of the overall populations, others take division numbers and labeling of the cells into account. in this work, we present a modeling and computational framework for proliferating cell populations undergoing symmetric cell division, which incorporates both the discrete division number and continuous label dynamics. thus, it allows for the consideration of division number-dependent parameters as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction with labeling experiments, e.g., performed with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (cfse), and can be shown to be a generalization of most existing models used to describe these data. we prove that under mild assumptions the resulting system of coupled partial differential equations (pdes) can be decomposed into a system of ordinary differential equations (odes) and a set of decoupled pdes, which drastically reduces the computational effort for simulating the model. furthermore, the pdes are solved analytically and the ode system is truncated, which allows for the prediction of the label distribution of complex systems using a low-dimensional system of odes. in addition to modeling the label dynamics, we link the label-induced fluorescence to the measure fluorescence which includes autofluorescence. furthermore, we provide an analytical approximation for the resulting numerically challenging convolution integral. this is illustrated by modeling and simulating a proliferating population with division number-dependent proliferation rate.
@background design and analysis of double-gate mosfets for ultra-low power radio frequency identification (rfid): device and circuit co-design subthreshold region of operation has gained wide research interest for applications requiring ultra low power consumption and medium frequency of operation. double gate mosfets are proved to be better candidates for subthreshold operation due to their near ideal subthreshold slope and negligible gate capacitance. however it is not yet clear whether symmetric (sdg) or asymmetric (adg) dg with options of tied (3t) and independent gates (4t) are optimal for subthreshold circuit design. in this paper, we compare the performance characteristics of sdg and adg circuits with tied(3t) and independent gate(4t) options for the subthreshold logic by applying them to some basic logic gates such as nand, nor gates for the 32nm technology node. we also present the performance comparisons of sdg and adg circuits for subthreshold logic in the presence of supply voltage and temperature variations. we found that 3t adg circuits offer approximately 13–14% better power consumption, 4–5% better speed and 16–18.3% better pdp than 3tsdg based circuits.
@method modifications of machine translation evaluation metrics by using word embeddings a goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. this is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. we propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. the model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. we report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.
@background beneficial effects of qili qiangxin capsule on lung structural remodeling in ischemic heart failure via tgf-β1/smad3 pathway background cytokine activation in the myocardium of deteriorating patients with heart failure who undergo left ventricular assist-device (lvad) implantation has been documented, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. we hypothesized the innate immune system is activated with expression of toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), leading to cytokine activation in these patients.   methods we used quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure tlr4, interleukin-1 (il-1) receptor, il-1 beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) mrna expression in myocardial samples from 36 patients. we compared 18 patients who underwent lvad implantation with 18 patients with less severe heart failure who underwent elective heart transplantation.   results toll-like receptor 4 expression was 1.69-fold greater (p < 0.05) and il-1 receptor expression was 3.64-fold greater (p < 0.0001) in the deteriorating patients who required lvads. myocardial tnf-alpha (1.71-fold, p < 0.05), il-6 (2.57-fold, p < 0.005), and il-1 beta (9.78-fold, p < 0.001) also were increased in the lvad candidates. toll-like receptor 4 expression correlated strongly with il-1 receptor expression (r= 0.75, p < 0.0001) and with il-1 beta expression in individual patients (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001). interleukin-1 receptor expression also correlated with il-1 beta expression (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) within patients. we found no correlation between tlr4 and either tnf-alpha or il-6 expression.   conclusions patients who required lvad support showed evidence of innate immune system activation, indicated by an increase in the key effector molecule tlr4 associated with a specific pattern of cytokine expression in the myocardium.
@background hospitalizations of older patients with human immunodeficiency virus in the united states. objectives: to alert persons in the public and private healthcare professions to the increasing trends in higher proportions of persons aged 50 and older who are newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and who are living with hiv and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).
@background adaptive evolution of the venom-targeted vwf protein in opossums that eat pitvipers the ligand binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (acchor) is localized in the alpha-subunit within a domain containing the tandem cys-192 and -193. by analyzing the binding-site region of acchor from animal species that are resistant to alpha-neurotoxins, we have previously shown that four residues in this region, at positions 187, 189, 194, and 197, differ between animals sensitive (e.g., mouse) and resistant (e.g., mongoose and snake) to alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-btx). in the present study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on a fragment of the mongoose acchor alpha-subunit (residues 122-205) and exchanged residues 187, 189, 194, and 197, either alone or in combination, with those present in the mouse alpha-subunit sequence. only the mongoose fragment in which all four residues were mutated to the mouse ones exhibited alpha-btx binding similar to that of the mouse fragment. the mongoose double mutation in which leu-194 and his-197 were replaced with proline residues, which are present at these positions in the mouse acchor and in all other toxin binders, bound alpha-btx to approximately 60% of the level of binding exhibited by the mouse fragment. in addition, replacement of either pro-194 or -197 in the mouse fragment with serine and histidine, respectively, markedly decreased alpha-btx binding. all other mutations resulted in no or just a small increase in alpha-btx binding. these results have led us to propose two subsites in the binding domain for alpha-btx: the proline subsite, which includes pro-194 and -197 and is critical for alpha-btx binding, and the aromatic subsite, which includes amino acid residues 187 and 189 and determines the extent of alpha-btx binding.
@method eicosapentaenoic acid combined with optimal statin therapy improves endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease endothelial function is thought to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension and heart failure. in the 1990s, high-frequency ultrasonographic imaging of the brachial artery to assess endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation (fmd) was developed. the technique provokes the release of nitric oxide, resulting in vasodilation that can be quantitated as an index of vasomotor function. the noninvasive nature of the technique allows repeated measurements over time to study the effectiveness of various interventions that may affect vascular health. however, despite its widespread use, there are technical and interpretive limitations of this technique. state-of-the-art information is presented and insights are provided into the strengths and limitations of high-resolution ultrasonography of the brachial artery to evaluate vasomotor function, with guidelines for its research application in the study of endothelial physiology.
@method effect of of atp on neurons of the rat intact nodose ganglion the effects of divalent cations on responses to 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐ht), gamma‐aminobutyric acid (gaba) and 1,1‐dimethyl‐4‐phenyl piperazinium (dmpp) were investigated using a sucrose‐gap method to record population responses. in ca‐free medium responses to 5‐ht were enhanced, those to dmpp depressed and those to gaba unchanged. in mg‐free medium responses to 5‐ht were unchanged, while those to dmpp and gaba were depressed. removal of both ca and mg from the superfusion medium caused a small reduction of gaba responses and a large reduction of dmpp responses. responses to 5‐ht were not only greatly potentiated but were changed in character; the depolarizing phase became sigmoid and the dose dependence between quantity of 5‐ht and response magnitude was lost as if 5‐ht were triggering an all‐or‐nothing phenomenon. dose‐‐response relationships for gaba were normal in the large majority of preparations. in about 10% of preparations, supramaximal amounts of gaba or dmpp evoked large responses of a similar character to those evoked by 5‐ht. the large responses, generated by an unknown mechanism, were termed x responses. further reduction in tissue divalent cations by egta (1 mm) caused x responses to be generated spontaneously. ca, mg, mn or co (1 mm) could suppress x responses. dmpp responses, reduced in ca/mg‐free medium, were largely restored by 1 mm‐ca. depression of gaba responses in ca/mg‐free medium could be entirely attributed to the absence of mg, mn being able to substitute for mg. x responses were generated only after equilibration for 1 h with ca/mg‐free medium. attempts to manipulate [ca]i with dinitrophenol or caffeine did not produce the conditions under which x responses were generated. intracellular records of responses to 5‐ht, gaba or dmpp showed that cells with a fibres responded to gaba but not to 5‐ht or dmpp. fifty‐four out of sixty‐seven cells with c fibre axons (80%) were depolarized by 5‐ht, thirty‐seven out of forty‐nine (76%) by dmpp and forty out of fifty‐seven (70%) by gaba. eighteen out of thirty‐eight (47%) c cells were depolarized by all three agents. some c cells were very sensitive to 5‐ht, 10(‐6) m evoking a substantial response. in most, responses to 10(‐5) m‐5‐ht had a slower rate of rise than responses to 10(‐4) or 10(‐3) m‐gaba or dmpp, yet lower 5‐ht concentrations normally elicited x responses in sucrose‐gap experiments whereas gaba or dmpp normally did not.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
@method perceptions of environmental opportunities for physical activity in the european union physically active lifestyles are regularly associated with improved health and quality of life. differences in lifestyles in society can partly be understood through the differences in the social and physical environment. this study examines the relationships between reported physical activity, and the extent of perceived support for physical activity in the physical and policy environment (e.g. facilities, programmes and other opportunities), and in the social environment. the data for the study come from a cross-cultural health policy study called mareps. in total, 3342 adults, 18 years or older, from six countries (belgium, finland, germany, the netherlands, spain, switzerland) were interviewed via telephone. respondents were categorised as active or inactive according to self-reported physical activity. social environmental factors and physical and policy environmental factors were also assessed. the analysis of the data was informed by social cognitive theory, although the study was not originally designed for this purpose. sixty-eight percent of females and 70% of males were active. the proportions of active and inactive varied by countries to a great extent. the strongest independent predictor of being physically active was social environment. those who perceived low social support from their personal environment (i.e. family, friends, school and workplace) were more than twice as likely to be sedentary compared to those who reported high social support from their personal environment. specific knowledge of the programmes and actions for physical activity and sport was also a strong predictor of being active. a supportive physical and policy environment was not associated with participation in physical activity as strongly as had been anticipated. the variation between countries was stronger predictor of being active than the physical and policy environment variables. this study generates the hypotheses and raises the questions that in a preliminary way, there appears to be some relationships between aspects of physical and social environment and physical activity participation. however, future research is needed to refine and clarify this.
@method gene-environment interaction in the etiology of mathematical ability using snp sets the twins early development study (teds) focuses on the early development of the three most common psychological problems in childhood: communication disorders, mild mental impairment and behavior problems. the teds twins were assessed longitudinally at 2, 3, 4 and 7 years of age in order to investigate genetic and environmental contributions to change and continuity in language and cognitive development; it is multivariate in order to examine the origins of comorbidity; and it uses a large sample in order to study abnormal development in the context of normal development. the twins were identified from birth records of twins born in the uk in 1994-96. more than 15,000 pairs of twins have been enrolled in teds and the participating families are representative of the uk. the measures at 2, 3 and 4 years are administered by parents. at 7 years, children are assessed for language and cognitive development using telephone testing, parents and children are interviewed about behavior problems, and teachers also assess behavior problems as well as academic achievement. one set of findings is that the same genes largely contribute to both language and cognitive problems and the same genes affect normal and abnormal development, a result that suggests that general impairment may be a better target for genetic research than specific language impairment independent of nonverbal cognitive problems. dna has been obtained so far for more than 4000 pairs and is being used initially in molecular genetic studies of language problems and hyperactivity.
@background behavior based dependability estimation - estimating the dependability of autonomous mobile systems using predictive filter dependability is widely understood as an integrated concept that consists of different attributes. the set of attributes and requirements of each attribute varies from application to application thus making it very challenging to define dependability for a broad amount of application. the dependability, however, is of great importance when dealing with autonomous or semi-autonomous systems, thus defining dependability for those kind of system is vital. such autonomous mobile system are usually described by their behavior. in this paper a minimum set of attributes for the dependability of autonomous mobile systems is proposed based on a behavioral definition of dependability.
@result lamivudine plus adefovir or entecavir for patients with chronic hepatitis b resistant to lamivudine and adefovir. multi‐drug resistant hepatitis b virus (hbv) has been reported in hepatitis b patients who received sequential antiviral therapy. in vitro studies showed that hbv constructs with mutations resistant to lamivudine and adefovir have marked reduction in sensitivity to combination of lamivudine and adefovir, whereas constructs with mutations resistant to either drug remain sensitive to the other drug. we conducted this study to determine whether mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same hbv genome in vivo and to describe the evolution of these mutations. sera from six patients who had been found to have multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations to lamivudine + adefovir, lamivudine + hepatitis b immunoglobulin (hbig), or lamivudine + entecavir on direct sequencing were cloned after nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). analysis of 215 clones from 11 samples with multi‐drug resistant mutations on direct sequencing showed that 183 (85%) clones had mutations to both therapies on the same genome; 31 clones had lamivudine‐resistant mutants only. clonal analysis of serial samples from three patients showed progressive evolution from all clones with lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only to mixtures of clones that have multi‐drug resistant mutations and clones that have lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only, and ultimately all clones having multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations. in conclusion, mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same viral genome, suggesting that combination therapy directed against mutants resistant to each treatment may not be adequate in suppressing multi‐drug resistant hbv. de novo combination therapy may prevent the emergence of multi‐drug resistant mutants.

@method metamorphic testing for software quality assessment: a study of search engines metamorphic testing (mt) is an effective methodology for testing those so-called ``non-testable'' programs (e.g., scientific programs), where it is sometimes very difficult for testers to know whether the outputs are correct. in metamorphic testing, metamorphic relations (mrs) (which specify how particular changes to the input of the program under test would change the output) play an essential role. however, testers may typically have to obtain mrs manually. in this paper, we propose a search-based approach to automatic inference of polynomial mrs for a program under test. in particular, we use a set of parameters to represent a particular class of mrs, which we refer to as polynomial mrs, and turn the problem of inferring mrs into a problem of searching for suitable values of the parameters. we then dynamically analyze multiple executions of the program, and use particle swarm optimization to solve the search problem. to improve the quality of inferred mrs, we further use mr filtering to remove some inferred mrs. we also conducted three empirical studies to evaluate our approach using four scientific libraries (including 189 scientific functions). from our empirical results, our approach is able to infer many high-quality mrs in acceptable time (i.e., from 9.87 seconds to 1231.16 seconds), which are effective in detecting faults with no false detection.
@method association between maternal depression symptoms across the first eleven years of their child’s life and subsequent offspring suicidal ideation the development of a 10-item self-report scale (epds) to screen for postnatal depression in the community is described. after extensive pilot interviews a validation study was carried out on 84 mothers using the research diagnostic criteria for depressive illness obtained from goldberg's standardised psychiatric interview. the epds was found to have satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, and was also sensitive to change in the severity of depression over time. the scale can be completed in about 5 minutes and has a simple method of scoring. the use of the epds in the secondary prevention of postnatal depression is discussed.
@background highly specific detection of myostatin prodomain by an immunoradiometric sandwich assay in serum of healthy individuals and patients humoral and tumoral factors collectively promote cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting by increasing protein degradation. although several humoral proteins, namely tnfα (tumour necrosis factor α) and il (interleukin)-6, have been shown to induce skeletal muscle wasting, there is a lack of information regarding the tumoral factors that contribute to the atrophy of muscle during cancer cachexia. therefore, in the present study, we have characterized the secretome of c26 colon cancer cells to identify the tumoral factors involved in cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. in the present study, we show that myostatin, a procachectic tgfβ (transforming growth factor β) superfamily member, is abundantly secreted by c26 cells. consistent with myostatin signalling during cachexia, treating differentiated c2c12 myotubes with c26 cm (conditioned medium) resulted in myotubular atrophy due to the up-regulation of muscle-specific e3 ligases, atrogin-1 and murf1 (muscle ring-finger protein 1), and enhanced activity of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. furthermore, the c26 cm also activated actriib (activin receptor type ii b)/smad and nf-κb (nuclear factor κb) signalling, and reduced the activity of the igf-i (insulin-like growth factor 1)/pi3k (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/akt pathway, three salient molecular features of myostatin action in skeletal muscles. antagonists to myostatin prevented c26 cm-induced wasting in muscle cell cultures, further confirming that tumoral myostatin may be a key contributor in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia. finally, we show that treatment with c26 cm induced the autophagy–lysosome pathway and reduced the number of mitochondria in myotubes. these two previously unreported observations were recapitulated in skeletal muscles collected from c26 tumour-bearing mice.
@result quercetin is equally or more effective than resveratrol in attenuating tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes. the facilitative glucose transporter, glut4, mediates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscles, and the participation of glut4 in the pathogenesis of various clinical conditions associated with obesity, visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance has been proposed. glucose uptake by some members of the glut family, mainly glut1, is inhibited by flavonoids, the natural polyphenols present in fruits, vegetables and wine. therefore it is of interest to establish if these polyphenolic compounds present in the diet, known to be effective antioxidants but also endowed with several other biological activities such as protein-tyrosine kinase inhibition, interfere with glut4 function. in the present study, we show that three flavonoids, quercetin, myricetin and catechin-gallate, inhibit the uptake of methylglucose by adipocytes over the concentration range of 10-100 microm. these three flavonoids show a competitive pattern of inhibition, with k(i)=16, 33.5 and 90 microm respectively. in contrast, neither catechin nor gallic acid inhibit methylglucose uptake. to obtain a better understanding of the interaction among glut4 and flavonoids, we have derived a glut4 three-dimensional molecular comparative model, using structural co-ordinates from a glut3 comparative model and a mechanosensitive ion channel [pdb (protein data bank) code 1msl] solved by x-ray diffraction. on the whole, the experimental evidence and computer simulation data favour a transport inhibition mechanism in which flavonoids and glut4 interact directly, rather than by a mechanism related to protein-tyrosine kinase and insulin signalling inhibition. furthermore, the results suggest that glut transporters are involved in flavonoid incorporation into cells.
@method converting redox signaling to apoptotic activities by stress-responsive regulators hsf1 and nrf2 in fenretinide treated cancer cells we describe a powerful approach, component plane presentation integrated self‐organizing map (som), for the analysis of microarray data. this approach allows the display of multi‐dimensional som outputs of microarray data in multiple sample specific presentations, providing distinct advantages in visual inspection of biological significances of genes clustered in each map unit with respect to each rna sample. beneficial potentials of the approach are highlighted by processing microarray data from yeast cells as well as human breast malignancies.
@result dynamics of sleep–wake cyclicity at night across the human lifespan the ontogenesis of sleep was studied in prematures from 32 to 41 weeks of gestational age the characteristics of the eeg, the patterns and rate of respiration, the cardiac rate, body motility comprised of localized and diffuse movements, localized and diffuse jerks, clonic movements and electromyo-graphic activity of the chin, as well as periods of total quietness were observed and correlated with the progressive organization of behavior in these infants. the data obtained at each gestational age, i.e., at 32–34 weeks, 35–37 weeks, and 38–41 weeks, were compared to those obtained in full-term newborns. the relationships between the different events and the features of the eeg and of the respiratory patterns were ascertained and compared to similar data obtained in the full-term newborn. this comparison shows that the premature at 40 weeks of gestational age has not attained a level of organization as high as that of the full-term newborn. an hypothesis suggesting a possible mechanism of this discrepancy is presented.
@method adaptive management in agricultural innovation systems: the interactions between innovation networks and their environment transforum is an innovation program which aims to make a substantial contribution to the transition towards more sustainable development of the dutch agricultural sector. this article describes the scientific foundation and architecture of this program. transforum operates on the basis of five working hypotheses which together constitute one integrated analytical framework. these hypotheses are: (1) sustainable development is a dynamic system property; (2) sustainable development needs system innovation; (3) system innovation is a non-linear learning process; (4) system innovation requires active participation of relevant key players from knowledge institutes, governmental bodies, civil society organisations and the business community; (5) the program requires transdisciplinary collaboration of all players. transforum identifies three new innovation strategies: (1) vital clusters; (2) regional development; (3) international agro-food networks; as alternatives to the current arrangements. innovative projects are organised in these innovation strategies. the aim of the scientific program is threefold: (1) it addresses research questions raised in the innovative projects; (2) it investigates the need for system-innovations and the way in which they can be realized; (3) it designs research projects to test the 5 main working hypotheses of the program. the scientific program is organised in four themes following a cyclic innovation process which is constantly monitored. the cycle starts with people’s preferences and images, followed by studies on which inventions are required to achieve a successful innovation. subsequently, it is investigated how to organize new innovations and transitions and finally, how citizen/consumers behaviour and preferences mobilizes sustainable development, closing the loop.
@method improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
@result reduced cardiac stiffness following exercise is associated with preserved myocardial collagen characteristics in the rat left ventricular (lv) chamber and myocardial wall compliance were investigated in rats with exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. voluntary exercise training was performed on running wheels. after 16 wk of exercise training, cardiac performance was measured in anesthetized open-chest ventilated rats. lv end-diastolic performance was calculated from both short-axis external diameter and long-axis segmental length measurements. exercise-trained rats developed significant lv hypertrophy (1.03 +/- 0.02 g) compared with control rats (0.91 +/- 0.03 g; p < 0.01). the physiological hypertrophy was associated with an increased lv wall thickness-to-internal radius ratio consistent with a concentric geometry. lv end-diastolic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-strain relationship) was decreased in both the short (p < 0.02) and long (p < 0.02) axis of lv as a result of exercise training. the lv end-diastolic chamber stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship) was also decreased in the exercised group (p < 0.05). the decreased chamber stiffness occurred as a consequence of a decrease in the regional myocardial wall elastic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic stress-strain relationship; p < 0.05). thus an increased lv wall thickness as a result of exercise-induced lv hypertrophy is associated with an enhanced ventricular chamber compliance, which in turn is attributed to a decrease in the diastolic stiffness of the myocardial wall.
@background preventive effect of aminoguanidine compared to vitamin e and c on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
@background hon cheung lee as messengers for calcium mobilization adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( naadp ) cyclic adp-ribose and nicotinic acid objective—glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) increases intracellular ca2+ concentrations ([ca2+]i), resulting in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. the molecular mechanism(s) of the glp-1–mediated regulation of [ca2+]i was investigated. research design and methods—glp-1–induced changes in [ca2+]i were measured in β-cells isolated from cd38+/+ and cd38−/− mice. calcium-mobilizing second messengers were identified by measuring levels of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (naadp) and cyclic adp-ribose (adpr), using a cyclic enzymatic assay. to locate naadp- and cyclic adpr–producing enzyme(s), cellular organelles were separated using the sucrose gradient method. results—a glp-1–induced [ca2+]i increase showed a cooperative ca2+ signal, i.e., an initial [ca2+]i rise mediated by the action of naadp that was produced in acidic organelles and a subsequent long-lasting increase of [ca2+]i by the action of cyclic adpr that was produced in plasma membranes and secretory granules. glp-1 sequentially stimulated production of naadp and cyclic adpr in the organelles through protein kinase a and camp-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor ii. furthermore, the results showed that naadp production from acidic organelles governed overall ca2+ signals, including insulin secretion by glp-1, and that in addition to cd38, enzymes capable of synthesizing naadp and/or cyclic adpr were present in β-cells. these observations were supported by the study with cd38−/− β-cells, demonstrating production of naadp, cyclic adpr, and ca2+ signal with normal insulin secretion stimulated by glp-1. conclusions—our findings demonstrate that the glp-1–mediated ca2+ signal for insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells is a cooperative action of naadp and cyclic adpr spatiotemporally formed by multiple enzymes.
@background object tracking using local multiple features and a posterior probability measure template matching is one of the principle techniques in visual tracking. various similarity measures have been developed to find the target in an acquired image by matching with a template. however, mismatching or misidentification may sporadically occur due to the influence of the background pixels included in the designated target model. taking into account the statistical features of a search region, a novel similarity measure is proposed, which can decrease the interference of the background pixels enclosed in the model. it highlights the significant target features and at the same time reduces the influence of the features shared by both the target and the background. it exhibits an excellent monotonic property and a distinct peak-like distribution. this new measure is also demonstrated to have a direct interpretation of posterior probability and is named as posterior probability measure (ppm). the proposed ppm can be obtained through a pixel-wise computation and exhibits suitability for image matching. the pixel-wise computation also enables a fast measure update after a target region has changed, which results in a new adaptive scaling method for tracking a target with a varying size. experiments show that it provides a higher precision in the localization and a discriminatory power superior to the existing similarity measures, such as bhattacharyya coefficient, kullback-leibler divergence, and normalized cross correlation. the effectiveness of the adaptive scaling method is demonstrated in experiments.
@background human papillomavirus knowledge and awareness among vietnamese mothers purpose recent increases in incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the united states have been attributed to human papillomavirus (hpv) infection, but empirical evidence is lacking.   patients and methods hpv status was determined for all 271 oropharyngeal cancers (1984-2004) collected by the three population-based cancer registries in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) residual tissue repositories program by using polymerase chain reaction and genotyping (inno-lipa), hpv16 viral load, and hpv16 mrna expression. trends in hpv prevalence across four calendar periods were estimated by using logistic regression. observed hpv prevalence was reweighted to all oropharyngeal cancers within the cancer registries to account for nonrandom selection and to calculate incidence trends. survival of hpv-positive and hpv-negative patients was compared by using kaplan-meier and multivariable cox regression analyses.   results hpv prevalence in oropharyngeal cancers significantly increased over calendar time regardless of hpv detection assay (p trend < .05). for example, hpv prevalence by inno-lipa increased from 16.3% during 1984 to 1989 to 71.7% during 2000 to 2004. median survival was significantly longer for hpv-positive than for hpv-negative patients (131 v 20 months; log-rank p < .001; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% ci, 0.21 to 0.46). survival significantly increased across calendar periods for hpv-positive (p = .003) but not for hpv-negative patients (p = .18). population-level incidence of hpv-positive oropharyngeal cancers increased by 225% (95% ci, 208% to 242%) from 1988 to 2004 (from 0.8 per 100,000 to 2.6 per 100,000), and incidence for hpv-negative cancers declined by 50% (95% ci, 47% to 53%; from 2.0 per 100,000 to 1.0 per 100,000). if recent incidence trends continue, the annual number of hpv-positive oropharyngeal cancers is expected to surpass the annual number of cervical cancers by the year 2020.   conclusion increases in the population-level incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the united states since 1984 are caused by hpv infection.
@background cadmium induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin and increases expression of c-myc and abcb1a in kidney proximal tubule cells cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
@method cardiorespiratory fitness in breast cancer patients: a call for normative values doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was used as a model to prospectively investigate neuroendocrine changes during the development of left ventricular dysfunction. radionuclide ventriculography, frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability (hrv), and plasma noradrenaline and natriuretic peptide measurements were performed in 27 adult lymphoma patients at baseline and after cumulative doxorubicin doses of 200, 400 and 500 mg/m(2). the left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) decreased from 58.1+/-1.4% to 50.3+/-1.1% (p<0.001) and 49.3+/-1.7% (p<0.001) after cumulative doxorubicin doses of 400 and 500 mg/m(2) respectively. with a doxorubicin dose of up to 400 mg/m(2) there was an increase in sympathetic tone, characterized by a decrease in the normalized high-frequency (hf(nu)) power (p=0.011), and increases in the normalized low-frequency (lf(nu)) power (p=0.011), the lf/hf ratio (p=0.021) and the plasma noradrenaline concentration (p=0.034). the decrease in lvef was correlated with the changes in lf(nu) and hf(nu) power (r=0.540, p=0.012) and lf/hf ratio (r=-0.452, p=0.04). however, after the cumulative doxorubicin dose of 500 mg/m(2) the changes in hrv components and plasma noradrenaline levels returned towards baseline. this was accompanied by increased concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (p=0.004) and brain natriuretic peptide (p=0.021). our findings suggest that doxorubicin-induced left ventricular dysfunction is associated with an early change in sympathovagal balance towards sympathetic predominance. along with further progression of left ventricular dysfunction, there is an attenuation of sympathetic tone, which may be attributable to sympatho-adrenal inhibition by increased secretion of natriuretic peptides.
@background germinal center selection and affinity maturation require dynamic regulation of mtorc1 kinase b cells have a need for speed high-affinity antibodies provide long-lasting protective immunity against many infections. generating such antibodies requires help, in the form of t cells, which interact with antibody-producing b cells. as b cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes, t cells select the cells producing high-affinity antibodies. gitlin et al. show in mice that b cells that receive t cell help transit through the cell cycle more quickly by increasing the speed at which replication forks progress. such a rapid cell cycle transition gives high-affinity b cells a selective advantage. science, this issue p. 643 t cells help select high-affinity antibodies by increasing the speed at which b cells progress through the cell cycle. the germinal center (gc) is a microanatomical compartment wherein high-affinity antibody-producing b cells are selectively expanded. b cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes in the dark zone (dz) of the gc and are then selected by t cells in the light zone (lz) on the basis of affinity. here, we show that t cell help regulates the speed of cell cycle phase transitions and dna replication of gc b cells. genome sequencing and single-molecule analyses revealed that t cell help shortens s phase by regulating replication fork progression, while preserving the relative order of replication origin activation. thus, high-affinity gc b cells are selected by a mechanism that involves prolonged dwell time in the dz where selected cells undergo accelerated cell cycles.
@background hypertension and its association with the severity of chronic periodontitis : a preliminary study chronic periodontitis is a common inflammatory disorder that is being contemplated as a risk factor for atherosclerotic complications. current epidemiological evidence also supports its potential association with increases in blood pressure levels and hypertension prevalence. furthermore, data from cross-sectional studies suggest that in hypertensive subjects periodontitis may enhance the risk and degree of target organ damage. a possible pathogenetic background of an effect of periodontitis on blood pressure should include the systemic generalization of the local oral inflammation, the role of the host immune response, the direct microbial effect on the vascular system and alterations in endothelial function. inversely, the concept of hypertension unfavorably affecting periodontal tissues cannot be excluded. the two conditions share multiple common risk factors that should be readily controlled for when assessing a possible association. thoroughly designed prospective and interventional trials are needed in order to determine the impact of periodontitis on blood pressure regulation and incident hypertension and its integration in the clinical approach of both dental and hypertensive patients.
@result spatial transcriptional profile of pept1 mrna in the yolk sac and small intestine in broiler chickens chick embryos derive nutrients from the yolk during incubation and transition to intestinal absorption of nutrients posthatch. the uptake of nutrients is mediated by a variety of membrane-bound transporter proteins. the objective of this study was to determine the expression profiles of nutrient transporters and digestive enzymes during incubation in the yolk sac membrane (ysm) and embryonic intestine of egg-laying (leghorn) and meat-producing (cobb) chickens derived from 22 to 30 wk (young) and 45 to 50 wk (old) breeder flocks. transporters examined included the peptide transporter pept1, the glutamate/aspartate (eaat3), cationic (cat-1) and neutral (b0at) amino acid transporters, and the fructose (glut5) and glucose (sglt1) transporters. digestive enzymes included aminopeptidase n (apn) and sucrase-isomaltase (si). expression of these genes was assessed by real-time pcr using the absolute quantification method in ysm at embryonic day (e) 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 21 and intestine at e15, 17, 19, 20, and 21. the pept1 and apn gene expression in the ysm increased until e15 and then decreased until e21, whereas expression in the intestine increased from e15 to e21. the b0at showed a similar pattern, with greatest expression in the ysm occurring at e17/e19. the cat1 and glut5 genes showed decreased expression in the ysm and increased expression in the intestine until e17/e19 and then a decrease until e21. expression of sglt1 and eaat3 showed increased gene expression over time in both the intestine and ysm. expression of si showed little to no gene expression in the ysm, whereas the intestine exhibited consistently high levels of gene expression. in ysm and intestine, si expression was greater in leghorn than cobb, whereas cat1 and glut5 expression was greater in cobb than leghorn. expression of the apn, cat1, and si genes was greater in embryos from young flocks than old flocks in ysm and intestine. these results demonstrate that the ysm expresses many of the digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters typically associated with the intestine and that these genes show tissue- and development-specific patterns of expression.
@background incentive human-to-human chat support protocol the rapid growth of decentralized and unstructured peer-topeer (p2p) networks [3, 7] points to a new efficient paradigm for information exchange on the internet. a p2p network may exhibit a power-law topology [5] such that it can propagate queries quickly and, if implemented efficiently [7], it can locate objects in time, where is the number of nodes in the network. however, there are remaining problems with the p2p paradigm which complicates its deployment. freeriding and tragedy of the commons are two major problems. as shown in [1], nearly 70% of gnutella users do not share any file with the p2p community and nearly 50% of all search responses come from the top 1% of content sharing nodes. therefore, nodes that share resources are always congested and the tragedy of the commons [2] occurs. another problem is that many users misreport their connection types so as to discourage others from going to their sites for file download. worse yet, there is no service differentiation between users who do not share any information and users who contribute significantly to the p2p community. the objective of this paper is to design a mechanism that provides incentives for users to share information and offers preferential service to users who contribute to the p2p community. in particular, we address the following questions:
@method serotonin passes through myoendothelial gap junctions to promote pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell differentiation. myoendothelial gap junctions are involved in regulating systemic arterial smooth muscle cell phenotype and function, but their role in the regulation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (pasmc) phenotype is unknown. we therefore investigated in cocultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (paecs) and pasmcs whether myoendothelial gap junctional signaling played a role in paec-dependent regulation of pasmc phenotype. rat paecs and pasmcs were cocultured on opposite sides of a porous transwell membrane that permitted formation of heterotypic cell-cell contacts. immunostaining showed expression of the gap junctional protein connexin 43 (cx43) on projections extending into the membrane from both cell types. dye transfer exhibited functional gap junctional communication from paecs to pasmcs. pasmcs cocultured with paecs had a more contractile-like phenotype (spindle shape and increased expression of the contractile proteins myosin heavy chain, h1-calponin, and α-smooth muscle cell-actin) than pasmcs cocultured with pasmcs or cocultured without direct contact with paecs. transforming growth factor (tgf)-β1 signaling was activated in pasmcs cocultured with paecs, and the pasmc differentiation was inhibited by tgf-β type i receptor blockade. inhibition of gap junctional communication pharmacologically or by knock down of cx43 in paecs blocked tgf-β signaling and pasmc differentiation. these results implicate myoendothelial gap junctions as a gateway for paec-derived signals required for maintaining tgf-β-dependent pasmc differentiation. this study identifies an alternative pathway to paracrine signaling to convey regulatory signals from paecs to pasmcs and raises the possibility that dysregulation of this direct interaction is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertensive pulmonary vascular remodeling.
@method age estimation based on a single network with soft softmax of aging modeling !, model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. it is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. the problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. we argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. we describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. these models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by active contour models (snakes). the key difference is that our active shape models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. we show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. q 199s a&& prrss, in.
@background swimming behavior and velocities of barnacle cyprids in a downwelling flume field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. it is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. however, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. a dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. however, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. the numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. a simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. the implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. the dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. for near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. these hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. the interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off
@method african easterly waves during 2004—analysis using objective techniques abstract the existence of african easterly waves (aews) north of the african easterly jet (aej) core with maximum amplitude at low levels has been confirmed and clarified using radiosonde data and the u.k. meteorological office global model analysis from the hurricane season of 1995. at bamako (12.5°n, 8.0°w) the aews were characterized mainly by maximum amplitudes at the level of the aej (around 700 mb), whereas at dakar (14.7°n, 17.5°w) the waves were characterized by maxima between 850 and 950 mb. the low-level waves to the north of the aej arise in association with baroclinic interactions between the negative meridional potential vorticity (pv) gradients in the jet core and the positive low-level gradient of potential temperature, θ, enhanced by the presence of low-static-stability air north of the aej. these waves follow the positive meridional θ gradients over northern africa in contrast to the jet-level aews that follow the meridional pv gradients at the level of the aej. cross-correlation analysis...
@result d-kefs tower test performance in patients with lateral prefrontal cortex lesions: the importance of error monitoring problem-solving ability was investigated in 25 dsm-iiir schizophrenic (sc) patients using the tower of hanoi (toh) task. their performance was compared to that of: (1) 22 patients with neurosurgical unilateral prefrontal lesions, 11 left (lf) and 10 right hemisphere (rf); (2) 38 patients with unilateral temporal lobectomies, 19 left (lt) and 19 right (rt); and (3) 44 matched control subjects. like the rt and lf group, the schizophrenics were significantly impaired on the toh. the deficit shown by the schizophrenic group was equivalent whether or not the problems to be solved included goal-subgoal conflicts, unlike the lf group who were impaired specifically on these problems. the nature of the sc deficit was also distinct from that of the rt group, in that the problem-solving deficit remained after controlling for the effects of spatial memory performance. this study indicates, therefore, that neither focal frontal nor temporal lobe damage sustained in adult life is a sufficient explanation for the problem-solving deficits found in patients with schizophrenia.
@background word clarity as a metric in sampling keyboard test sets in text entry experiments, memorability is a desired property of the phrases used as stimuli. unfortunately, to date there is no automated method to achieve this effect. as a result, researchers have to use either manually curated english-only phrase sets or sampling procedures that do not guarantee phrases being memorable. in response to this need, we present a novel sampling method based on two core ideas: a multiple regression model over language-independent features, and the statistical analysis of the corpus from which phrases will be drawn. our results show that researchers can finally use a method to successfully curate their own stimuli targeting potentially any language or domain. the source code as well as our phrase sets are publicly available.
@method impact of physical incompatibility on drug mass flow rates: example of furosemide-midazolam incompatibility background: multiaccess infusion sets allow multiple simultaneous infusions but may induce interference in drug delivery resulting from large variations in the delivery rate of potent drugs. in this study, we sought to understand the influence of multiaccess infusion device properties (dead space volume and antireflux valve [arv]) on drug delivery during multi-infusion therapy. methods: infusion sets differing in length, dead space volume, and presence of an arv were assessed. three drugs were infused simultaneously through different access points, and their concentrations were obtained using uv spectrophotometric analysis of the effluent. different infusion configurations were compared by assessing (1) the amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time, (2) the mean amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time during the steady-state infusion (mass flow rate plateau), and (3) flow change efficiency calculated from the ratio of the area under the experimental instant mass flow rate curve to the area corresponding to theoretical instant mass flow rate curve. results: infusion sets with lower dead space volumes offered significantly higher flow change efficiency (53.0% ± 15.4% with a dead space volume equal to 0.046 ml 5 min after the start of infusion) than infusion sets with higher dead space volume (5.6% ± 8.2% with a dead space volume equal to 6.16 ml), whatever the flow rate changes. even in case of large dead space volumes, the presence of an arv significantly increased the mass flow rate plateau (from 92.4% to 99.3% of the theoretical plateau without and with the presence of an arv, respectively). conclusions: multi-infusion therapy induces perturbation in drug delivery. these perturbations (lag time, backflow, and bolus) could be reduced by using infusion sets including very low dead space volume and an arv.
@background the roadmap relapse prevention group counseling toolkit™: counselor adherence and competence outcomes. we evaluated a 2-day training workshop on motivational interviewing (mi) for addiction and mental health clinicians (n = 22). clinicians completed the helpful responses questionnaire (hrq) and taped interactions with a standardized patient (sp). independent, blinded coders rated the tapes using the motivational interviewing skills code (misc). post-training assessment showed significant increase on the hrq and two of four misc summary scores for sp interviews. at 2-month follow-up, means of the hrq and two misc summary scores remained higher than baseline, but declined from post-training. some mi skills improved to a greater degree than others, and a subset of clinicians (> 40%) showed continued improvement at follow-up. results were consistent across interviews with different sps, supporting the use of this assessment method. findings highlight the need for additional research on the use of standardized patients, alternative assessment techniques, and effective methods of technology transfer for mi skill acquisition and retention.
@method identification of targets of cug-bp, elav-like family member 1 (celf1) regulation in embryonic heart muscle microsatellite expansions cause a number of dominantly-inherited neurological diseases. expansions in coding-regions cause protein gain-of-function effects, while non-coding expansions produce toxic rnas that alter rna splicing activities of mbnl and celf proteins. bi-directional expression of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (sca8) ctg cag expansion produces cug expansion rnas (cugexp) from the atxn8os gene and a nearly pure polyglutamine expansion protein encoded by atxn8 cagexp transcripts expressed in the opposite direction. here, we present three lines of evidence that rna gain-of-function plays a significant role in sca8: 1) cugexp transcripts accumulate as ribonuclear inclusions that co-localize with mbnl1 in selected neurons in the brain; 2) loss of mbnl1 enhances motor deficits in sca8 mice; 3) sca8 cugexp transcripts trigger splicing changes and increased expression of the cugbp1-mbnl1 regulated cns target, gaba-a transporter 4 (gat4/gabt4). in vivo optical imaging studies in sca8 mice confirm that gabt4 upregulation is associated with the predicted loss of gabaergic inhibition within the granular cell layer. these data demonstrate that cugexp transcripts dysregulate mbnl/celf regulated pathways in the brain and provide mechanistic insight into the cns effects of other cugexp disorders. moreover, our demonstration that relatively short cugexp transcripts cause rna gain-of-function effects and the growing number of antisense transcripts recently reported in mammalian genomes suggest unrecognized toxic rnas contribute to the pathophysiology of polyglutamine cag ctg disorders.
@background hsp90 is essential under heat stress in the bacterium shewanella oneidensis. salmonellaenterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium (salmonella typhimurium) contamination of pork, is one of the major sources of human salmonellosis. the bacterium is able to persist and hide in asymptomatic carrier animals, generating a reservoir for salmonella transmission to other animals and humans. mechanisms involved in salmonella persistence in pigs remain poorly understood. in the present study, we demonstrate that the salmonellahtpg gene, encoding a homologue of the eukaryotic heat shock protein 90, contributes to salmonella typhimurium persistence in intestine-associated tissues of pigs, but not in the tonsils. htpg does not seem to play an important role during the acute phase of infection. the contribution to persistence was shown to be associated with htpg-dependent salmonella invasion and survival in porcine enterocytes and macrophages. these results reveal the role of htpg as a virulence factor contributing to salmonella persistence in pigs.
@method post-treatment lyme disease syndrome symptomatology and the impact on life functioning: is there something here? evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis were prepared by an expert panel of the infectious diseases society of america. these updated guidelines replace the previous treatment guidelines published in 2000 (clin infect dis 2000; 31[suppl 1]:1-14). the guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have these infections or may be at risk for them. for each of these ixodes tickborne infections, information is provided about prevention, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. tables list the doses and durations of antimicrobial therapy recommended for treatment and prevention of lyme disease and provide a partial list of therapies to be avoided. a definition of post-lyme disease syndrome is proposed.
@method mechanisms of subcutaneous absorption of rituximab in rats the neonatal fc receptor (fcrn) plays an important and well-known role in immunoglobulin g (igg) catabolism; however, its role in the disposition of igg after subcutaneous (sc) administration, including bioavailability, is relatively unknown. to examine the potential effect of fcrn on igg sc bioavailability, we engineered three anti-amyloid β monoclonal antibody (mab) reverse chimeric mouse igg2a (migg2a) fc variants (i253a.h435a, n434h and n434y) with different binding affinities to mouse fcrn (mfcrn) and compared their sc bioavailability to that of the wild-type (wt) mab in mice. our results indicated that the sc bioavailability of migg2a was affected by mfcrn-binding affinity. variant i253a.h435a, which did not bind to mfcrn at either ph 6.0 or ph 7.4, had the lowest bioavailability (41.8%). variant n434y, which had the greatest increase in binding affinity at both ph 6.0 and ph 7.4, had comparable bioavailability to the wt antibody (86.1% vs. 76.3%), whereas variant n434h, which had modestly increased binding affinity at ph 6.0 to mfcrn and affinity comparable to the wt antibody at ph 7.4, had the highest bioavailability (94.7%). a semi-mechanism-based pharmacokinetic model, which described well the observed data with the wt antibody and variant i253a.h435a, is consistent with the hypothesis that the decreased bioavailability of variant i253a.h435a was due to loss of the fcrn-mediated protection from catabolism at the absorption site. together, these data demonstrate that fcrn plays an important role in sc bioavailability of therapeutic igg antibodies.
@background matrix metalloproteinases expressed by astrocytes mediate extracellular amyloid-β peptide catabolism activated macrophages produce several matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of extracellular matrix (ecm)‐degrading enzymes, during wound healing and in other inflammatory states. in response to brain injury, brain microglia become “activated,” in a way similar to peripheral tissue macrophages, a process which includes differentiation and probably invasion and proliferation. little is known about the ecm‐degrading mmps that are secreted by microglia upon activation. thus, it was of interest to determine whether activated microglia secrete mmps. conditioned media samples obtained from cultured microglia that were stimulated with various activating agents were subjected to gelatin‐substrate zymography. microglia constitutively express low levels of a 94‐kda gelatinase (glase) activity. treatment with lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus for 24 hr stimulated the activity of the 94‐kda glase, 4‐20‐fold, in a dose‐dependent manner. addition of infγ inhibited the lps‐stimulated activity of mmp‐9. lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus also stimulated the secretion of il‐6 from microglia in a dose‐dependent manner. the 94‐kda glase activity was ca++ dependent, it was inhibited by 1,10‐phenanthroline, and it was activated by organomercurial compounds. when immunoblots were performed using specific antisera against the 94‐kda gelatinase b (mmp‐9) with untreated and lps‐stimulated conditioned medium samples, a 94‐kda immunopositive band was observed. thus, it appears that the 94‐kda glase is gelatinase b (mmp‐9). these results indicate that activators of peripheral macrophages are potent secretagogues for the mmps in cultured microglia. the ability of activated microglia to secrete mmps suggests that these enzymes may play an important function in the brain parenchyma during inflammatory states. © 1995 wiley‐liss, inc.
@method relating diseases by integrating gene associations and information flow through protein interaction network in our previous publication, a framework for information flow in interaction networks based on random walks with damping was formulated with two fundamental modes: emitting and absorbing. while many other network analysis methods based on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes. in addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier formalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein functions and pathways. however, the directed flow from origins to destinations was induced via a potential function that was heuristic. here, with a theoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier work for directed information flow. this is achieved by constructing a potential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the channel mode. for each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a channel tensor. the entries of the channel tensor at each node can be interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a destination. similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses damping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow. through examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate the versatility and stability of our new framework.
@background increased reactive oxygen species formation and oxidative stress in rheumatoid arthritis abstract this study aims to elucidate plasma oxidant/antioxidant status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). fasting blood samples were obtained from 24 patients with ra and 20 control subjects. antioxidant potential (aop) value, nonenzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (nssa), and malondialdehyde (mda) levels were measured to establish plasma oxidant/antioxidant status in the patient and control groups. patients with ra had lower aop and nssa but higher mda levels than those of the control subjects, which was an indication of reduced antioxidant capacity and oxidant stress in these patients. results suggest that the antioxidant system is impaired and peroxidation reactions are accelerated in patients with ra. we suppose that therapeutic use of some antioxidants may be beneficial in this regard.
@result agroinfiltration reduces aba levels and suppresses pseudomonas syringae-elicited salicylic acid production in nicotiana tabacum plant hormones play important roles in regulating developmental processes and signalling networks involved in plant responses to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. salicylic acid (sa), jasmonates (ja) and ethylene (et) are well known to play crucial roles in plant disease and pest resistance. however, the roles of other hormones such as abscisic acid (aba), auxin, gibberellin (ga), cytokinin (ck) and brassinosteroid (bl) in plant defence are less well known. much progress has been made in understanding plant hormone signalling and plant disease resistance. however, these studies have mostly proceeded independently of each other, and there is limited knowledge regarding interactions between plant hormone-mediated signalling and responses to various pathogens. here, we review the roles of hormones other than sa, ja and et in plant defence and the interactions between hormone-mediated signalling, plant defence and pathogen virulence. we propose that these hormones may influence disease outcomes through their effect on sa or ja signalling.
@background degradation of mixtures of phenolic compounds by arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.

@result lack of character displacement in the male recognition molecule, bindin, in altantic sea urchins of the genus echinometra. bindin is a gamete recognition protein known to control species-specific sperm-egg adhesion and membrane fusion in sea urchins. previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. the present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of echinometra in central america: e. lucunter and e. viridis from the caribbean, and e. vanbrunti from the eastern pacific. the eggs of e. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. as in the indo-west pacific (iwp) echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the iwp species. maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of e. lucunter. we analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the e. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the american echinometra. instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.
@background high performance work systems: the gap between policy and practice in health care reform. objectives this study aimed to build on the increasing evidence of a link between good people management practice, and organizational and patient outcomes in public health care to document the important human resource management practices in our hospitals. methods the design included large scale survey of hospital managers' perceptions of the use of human resource management practices. the questionnaire included human resource management (hrm) measures and additional questions related to the australian hospital accreditation standards. data were collected in december 2003 until april 2004 from a total sample of 92 hospitals/hospital organizations from the state of victoria, australia. the participants were chief executive officers, human resource directors and two other senior managers of the hospital organizations were invited to complete the questionnaire. there were no interventions. the main outcome measure, one-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the perceptions of the three groups of managers' concerning the use of hrm practices. frequency and descriptive statistics were used to determine use of hrm practices. results a 67% response rate enabled us to document human resource management practices in victorian hospitals. the respondents reported limited strategic and organizational hrm. conclusion this study found limited evidence of sophisticated hrm practices among hospitals and hospital organizations in the state of victoria, australia. despite the increasing evidence of a relationship among effective hrm and health-care outcomes, these hospitals reported limited performance management, training and development, and employee empowerment and decision-making. the authors suggest that it is unlikely that attempts to improve patient safety in this sector will be successful until the deficits in hrm are addressed.
@result effect of low-level laser irradiation on the rate and short-term stability of rotational tooth movement in dogs. it has previously been reported that low-energy laser irradiation stimulated the velocity of tooth movement via the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b (rank)/rank ligand and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor/its receptor (c-fms) systems. matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v) beta(3) [alpha(v)beta3] integrin are essential for osteoclastogenesis; therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of low-energy laser irradiation on the expression of mmp-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v)beta3 integrin during experimental tooth movement. fifty male, 6-week-old wistar strain rats were used in the experiment. a total force of 10g was applied to the rat molars to induce tooth movement. a ga-al-as diode laser was used to irradiate the area around the moving tooth and, after 7 days, the amount of tooth movement was measured. to determine the amount of tooth movement, plaster models of the maxillae were made using a silicone impression material before (day 0) and after tooth movement (days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7). the models were scanned using a contact-type three-dimensional (3-d) measurement apparatus. immunohistochemical staining for mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 was performed. intergroup comparisons of the average values were conducted with a mann-whitney u-test for tooth movement and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap), mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3-positive cells. in the laser-irradiated group, the amount of tooth movement was significantly greater than that in the non-irradiated group at the end of the experiment (p < 0.05). cells positively stained with trap, mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 were found to be significantly increased in the irradiated group on days 2-7 compared with those in the non-irradiated group (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy laser irradiation facilitates the velocity of tooth movement and mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 expression in rats.
@background adult age differences in the color stroop test: a comparison between an item-by-item and a blocked version. the literature on interference in the stroop color-word task, covering over 50 years and some 400 studies, is organized and reviewed. in so doing, a set of 18 reliable empirical finding is isolated that must be captured by any successful theory of the stroop effect. existing theoretical positions are summarized and evaluated in view of this critical evidence and the 2 major candidate theories ―relative speed of processing and automaticity of reading― are found to be wanting. it is concluded that recent theories placing the explanatory weight on parallel processing of the irrelevant and the relevant dimensions are likely to be more sucessful than are earlier theories attempting to locate a single bottleneck in attention
@method assessing the effects of native plants on the pollination of an exotic herb, the blueweed echium vulgare (boraginaceae) aims in ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate of total species richness because many rare species are not detected. moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. for individual-based data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area sampled. for sample-based incidence (presence–absence) data, under a bernoulli product model, we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling units. methods the first objective is a problem in interpolation that we address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and coleman rarefaction (poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based rarefaction (bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies. the second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial model), a larger area (poisson model) or a larger number of sampling units (bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic species richness. although published methods exist for many of these objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators under a unified statistical and notational framework. this novel integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. we provide new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based rarefaction and for coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit of biodiversity measurement. we illustrate these methods with datasets for tropical beetles, tropical trees and tropical ants.
@background friends and enemies within: the roles of subgroups, imbalance, and isolates in geographically dispersed teams as organizations operate across greater distances, scholars are increasingly interested in the work of geographically dispersed teams and the technologies that they use to communicate and coordinate their work. however, research has generally not specified the dimensions (spatial, temporal, or configurational) and degrees of team dispersion, nor has it articulated the theoretical connections between those dimensions and important team outcomes. this research essay expands upon previous field and lab studies of dispersed teamwork by presenting a new conceptualization of dispersion as a continuous, multidimensional construct, in which each dimension is theoretically linked with different outcomes. we illustrate this new conceptualization with a series of examples from real dispersed teams and present implications for research regarding technology use.
@method self-regulatory failure and intimate partner violence perpetration. aggressive impulses arise from many factors, but they are usually held in check by social norms for self-control. thus, the proximal cause of aggression is often failure of self-restraint. in five studies, depleted capacity for self-regulation (caused by prior, even irrelevant acts of self-regulation) increased aggressive responding, especially after an insulting provocation. when participants were insulted and their self-regulatory strength was depleted (i.e., after completing previous tasks that required self-regulation), participants were more likely to aggress. when the urge to aggress was relatively weaker (i.e., when participants were not insulted), self-regulatory depletion did not increase aggressive behavior. this effect was moderated by trait self-control: participants low in trait self-control were particularly likely to express intentions of behaving aggressively in response to provocation, whereas participants high in trait self-control did not express intentions of responding aggressively. laboratory, autobiographical memory, and hypothetical responses confirmed the pattern.
@method depressive symptoms in the transition to menopause: the roles of irritability, personality vulnerability, and self-regulation a select group of investigators attended a structured workshop, the stages of reproductive aging workshop (straw), at park city, utah, usa, in july 2001, which addressed the need in women for a staging system as well as the confusing nomenclature for the reproductive years.
@background meanfield modeling of propofol-induced changes in spontaneous eeg rhythms the neuronal mechanisms of general anesthesia are still poorly understood. besides several characteristic features of anesthesia observed in experiments, a prominent effect is the bi-phasic change of power in the observed electroencephalogram (eeg), i.e. the initial increase and subsequent decrease of the eeg-power in several frequency bands while increasing the concentration of the anaesthetic agent. the present work aims to derive analytical conditions for this bi-phasic spectral behavior by the study of a neural population model. this model describes mathematically the effective membrane potential and involves excitatory and inhibitory synapses, excitatory and inhibitory cells, nonlocal spatial interactions and a finite axonal conduction speed. the work derives conditions for synaptic time constants based on experimental results and gives conditions on the resting state stability. further the power spectrum of local field potentials and eeg generated by the neural activity is derived analytically and allow for the detailed study of bi-spectral power changes. we find bi-phasic power changes both in monostable and bistable system regime, affirming the omnipresence of bi-spectral power changes in anesthesia. further the work gives conditions for the strong increase of power in the δ-frequency band for large propofol concentrations as observed in experiments.
@background analysis of the modulated acoustic radiation-force profile for a dual-beam confocal geometry. we describe theoretical principles of an imaging modality that uses the acoustic response of an object to a highly localized dynamic radiation force of an ultrasound field. in this method, named ultrasound-stimulated vibro-acoustography (usva), ultrasound is used to exert a low-frequency (in khz range) force on the object. in response, a portion of the object vibrates sinusoidally in a pattern determined by its viscoelastic properties. the acoustic emission field resulting from object vibration is detected and used to form an image that represents both the ultrasonic and low-frequency (khz range) mechanical characteristics of the object. we report the relation between the emitted acoustic field and the incident ultrasonic pressure field in terms of object parameters. also, we present the point-spread function of the imaging system. the experimental images in this report have a resolution of about 700 microm, high contrast, and high signal-to-noise ratio. usva is sensitive enough to detect object motions on the order of nanometers. possible applications include medical imaging and material evaluation.
@background the impact of pri-mir-218 rs11134527 on the risk and prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. more than 275,100 women die from cervical cancer each year. cervical squamous cell carcinoma (cervical scc), one of the most frequent types of cervical cancers, is associated with high-risk human papilloma virus (hpv), although hpv infection alone may not be enough to induce malignant transformation. micrornas (mirnas), a class of small non-coding rnas, regulate protein-coding gene expression by repressing translation or cleaving rna transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. a growing body of evidence suggests that mirnas contribute to cervical scc progression, development and metastasis. mirna expression signatures in scc (hypopharyngeal scc and esophageal scc) revealed that mir-218 expression was significantly reduced in cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous epithelium, suggesting that mir-218 is a candidate tumor suppressor. the aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of mir-218 in cervical scc and to identify novel mir-218-mediated cancer pathways in cervical scc. restoration of mir-218 significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in both hpv-positive and hpv-negative cervical scc cell lines. these data indicated that mir-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in cervical scc. our in silico analysis showed that mir-218 appeared to be an important modulator of tumor cell processes through suppression of many targets, particularly those involved in focal adhesion signaling pathways. gene expression data indicated that lamb3, a laminin protein known to influence cell differentiation, migration, adhesion, proliferation and survival, was upregulated in cervical scc clinical specimens, and silencing studies demonstrated that lamb3 functioned as an oncogene in cervical scc. the identification of novel tumor-suppressive mir-218-mediated molecular pathways has provided new insights into cervical scc oncogenesis and metastasis.
@method sleep-disordered breathing is a risk factor for delirium after cardiac surgery: a prospective cohort study background and objective:  osa is a common condition associated with cardiovascular (cv) morbidity. it remains underdiagnosed globally in part due to the limited availability and technical requirements of polysomnography (psg). the aim of this study was to test the accuracy of two simple methods for diagnosing osa.
@method synthetic lethals in hiv: ways to avoid drug resistance l-735,524 is a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) protease currently in a phase ii clinical trial. we report here the three-dimensional structure of l-735,524 complexed to hiv-2 protease at 1.9-a resolution, as well as the structure of the native hiv-2 protease at 2.5-a resolution. the structure of hiv-2 protease is found to be essentially identical to that of hiv-1 protease. in the crystal lattice of the hiv-2 protease complexed with l-735,524, the inhibitor is chelated to the active site of the homodimeric enzyme in one orientation. this feature allows an unambiguous assignment of protein-ligand interactions from the electron density map. both fourier and difference fourier maps reveal clearly the closure of the flap domains of the protease upon l-735,524 binding. specific interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitor include the hydroxy group of the hydroxyaminopentane amide moiety of l-735,524 ligating to the carboxyl groups of the essential asp-25 and asp-25' enzymic residues and the amide oxygens of the inhibitor hydrogen bonding to the backbone amide nitrogen of ile-50 and ile-50' via an intervening water molecule. a second bridging water molecule is found between the amide nitrogen n2 of l-735,524 and the carboxyl oxygen of asp-29'. although other hydrogen bonds also add to binding, an equally significant contribution to affinity arises from hydrophobic interactions between the protease and the inhibitor throughout the pseudo-symmetric s1/s1', s2/s2', and s3/s3' regions of the enzyme. except for its pyridine ring, all lipophilic moieties (t-butyl, indanyl, benzyl, and piperidyl) of l-735,524 are rigidly defined in the active site.
@result air quality and hospital outcomes in emergency medical admissions with respiratory disease in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, several episodes of extreme air pollution focused attention on the potential for adverse health effects of air pollution. these included an episode in the meuse valley, belgium, in december 1930 ( 15), an episode in donora, pennsylvania in 1948 (36), and several episodes in london, england (23, 44). the sudden large increases in sickness and death that accompanied such episodes demonstrated that air pollution can adversely affect human health. the increased mortality associated with such episodes provided the first quantitative measure of the adverse effects of air pollution. by the 1970s, a link had been well established between respiratory disease and particulate and/or sulfur-oxide air pollution, but still there remained disagreement as to the level of pollution that would significantly affect human health. in reviewing research published between 1968 and 1977, holland and several other prominent british scientists ( 19) concluded that particulate and related air pollution at high levels pose hazards to human health, but that health effects of particulate pollution at lower concentrations could not be "disentangled" from health effects of other factors. shy (45) responded by asserting that the review by holland et al systematically discounted evidence of pollution-related health effects at contemporary pollution levels. shy, and other reviewers ( 1, 12, 45, 54), contended that the cumulative weight of evidence provided sound reasons to believe that
@background exclusionary interactions among diverse fungi infecting developing seeds of centaurea stoebe. fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
@background the role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
@background common culture conditions for maintenance and cardiomyocyte differentiation of the human embryonic stem cell lines, bg01 and hues-7. this report, first published online on march 3, 2004, discusses the procedures used to develop 17 lines of human embryonic stem cells from the inner cell masses of blastocysts. these cell lines are available to researchers under a material transfer agreement; according to current regulations, the cells cannot be used for research supported by federal funds. these cells are expected to facilitate research on a variety of serious chronic diseases.
@background distinct regions control transcriptional activation of the alpha1(vi) collagen promoter in different tissues of transgenic mice the expression of type vi collagen has been studied in mouse tissues. by northern blotting, the mrna for the alpha 1 (vi) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10.5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. the messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. in 2-month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat were among the most active producers of alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in situ hybridization first identified mrna for alpha 1 (vi) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10.5-day embryos in various locations, including serosae, branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. in several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. this staining pattern was different from that for collagen type i, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. the pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in addition, the results confirmed that type vi collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. this was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. the data show that type vi collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue.
@background socs36e limits stat signaling via cullin2 and a socs-box independent mechanism in the drosophila egg chamber patterns of cell fates generated by morphogens are critically important for normal development; however, the mechanisms by which graded morphogen signals are converted into all-or-none cell fate responses are incompletely understood. in the drosophila ovary, high and sustained levels of the secreted morphogen unpaired (upd) specify the migratory border-cell population by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat). a lower or transient level of stat activity specifies a non-migratory population of follicle cells. here we identify mir-279 as a component of a feedback pathway that further dampens the response in cells with low levels of jak/stat activity. mir-279 directly repressed stat, and loss of mir-279 mimicked stat gain-of-function or loss of apontic (apt), a known feedback inhibitor of stat. apt was essential for mir-279 expression in non-migratory follicle cells, whereas another stat target, ken and barbie (ken), downregulated mir-279 in border cells. mathematical modelling and simulations of this regulatory circuit including mir-279, apt and ken supported key roles for mir-279 and apt in generating threshold responses to the upd gradient.
@background increased rostral anterior cingulate activity following positive mental imagery training in healthy older adults we can imagine looking at ourselves (observer perspective) or through our own eyes (field perspective). cognitive and clinical theories suggest that compared to field perspective, observer perspective imagery reduces emotional intensity, for example, of trauma memories. tests of causality are lacking and less is known about perspective and positive emotion. using contrasting experimental manipulations, participants imagined 100 positive descriptions from either (1) a field perspective or (2) an observer perspective, or (3) thought about their verbal meaning. affect was more positive after field than observer imagery and verbal conditions, with mood deterioration within the latter two. findings are the first to demonstrate causality of imagery perspective on emotion. further, the results demonstrate that imagining positive events from one's own perspective is critical to improving positive affect. treatment implications include promoting field imagery to facilitate a more rose-tinted view of positive events.
@result when are the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty large? many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
@background potential for multiple mechanisms, phenomena and algorithms for synaptic plasticity at single synapses experience-dependent potentiation and depression of synaptic strength has been proposed to subserve learning and memory by changing the gain of signals conveyed between neurons1,2. here we examine synaptic plasticity between individual neocortical layer-5 pyramidal neurons. we show that an increase in the synaptic response, induced by pairing action-potential activity in pre- and postsynaptic neurons, was only observed when synaptic input occurred at low frequencies. this frequency-dependent increase in synaptic responses arises because of a redistribution of the available synaptic efficacy and not because of an increase in the efficacy. redistribution of synaptic efficacy could represent a mechanism to change the content, rather than the gain, of signals conveyed between neurons.
@background modulating the folding of p-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator truncation mutants with pharmacological chaperones the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (cf) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (deltaf508) in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel. the deltaf508 mutation produces defects in folding, stability, and channel gating. to identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in deltaf508-cftr-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of deltaf508-cftr correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated deltaf508-cftr protein. biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved deltaf508-cftr folding at the er and stability at the cell surface. the bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected deltaf508-cftr in deltaf508/deltaf508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive cftr mutant (p574h-cftr) or a dopamine receptor mutant. small-molecule correctors may be useful in the treatment of cf caused by the deltaf508 mutation.
@method a two-stage pretreatment approach to maximise sugar yield and enhance reactive lignin recovery from poplar wood chips. an organosolv process involving extraction with hot aqueous ethanol has been evaluated for bioconversion of hybrid poplar to ethanol. the process resulted in fractionation of poplar chips into a cellulose‐rich solids fraction, an ethanol organosolv lignin (eol) fraction, and a water‐soluble fraction containing hemicellulosic sugars, sugar breakdown products, degraded lignin, and other components. the influence of four independent process variables (temperature, time, catalyst dose, and ethanol concentration) on product yields was analyzed over a broad range using a small composite design and response surface methodology. center point conditions for the composite design (180°c, 60 min, 1.25% h2so4, and 60% ethanol), yielded a solids fraction containing ∼88% of the cellulose present in the untreated poplar. approximately 82% of the total cellulose in the untreated poplar was recovered as monomeric glucose after hydrolysis of the solids fraction for 24 h using a low enzyme loading (20 filter paper units of cellulase/g cellulose); ∼85% was recovered after 48 h hydrolysis. total recovery of xylose (soluble and insoluble) was equivalent to ∼72% of the xylose present in untreated wood. approximately 74% of the lignin in untreated wood was recovered as eol. other cooking conditions resulted in either similar or inferior product yields although the distribution of components between the various fractions differed markedly. data analysis generated regression models that describe process responses for any combination of the four variables. © 2006 wiley periodicals, inc.

@method intermuscular relationship of human muscle fiber type proportions: slow leg muscles predict slow neck muscles biopsies of ventral neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, and longus colli) and dorsal neck muscles (rectus capitis posterior major, obliquus capitis inferior, splenius capitis, and trapezius) were taken from 64 patients who underwent spondylodesis for cervical dysfunction of different etiologies. the muscle fibers were classified histochemically as type i, iia, iib, or iic (transitional or intermediate fibers) according to the ph lability of their myofibrillar atpase. signs of muscle fiber transformations were observed in all muscles investigated, as evidenced by an increased relative amount of type‐iic fibers. the transformations occurred independently of (a) the type of muscle (i.e., more “postural” or more “phasic”), (b) the sex and age of the patient, (c) the type of condition, and (d) the presence of additional neurological deficits. thus, the same pattern of muscular reaction was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as in patients with soft‐tissue injuries of the neck (e.g., “whiplash injury”). in the ventral muscles and the obliquus capitis inferior, the occurrence of transformations correlated strongly with the duration of symptoms; in the ventral muscles the vast majority of transformations were encountered in patients with a shorter history of symptoms, whereas in the obliquus capitis inferior the reverse occurred. in the other dorsal muscles, no correlation with the duration of symptoms was found. muscles in which transformations had ceased displayed, on average, a significantly higher percentage of fast type‐iib fibers than were found in muscles with ongoing transformations. this strongly indicates that the transformations proceeded in the direction from “slow oxidative” to “fast glycolytic”.
@background interstitial f(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-pgf(2α) as a biomarker of oxidative stress after severe human traumatic brain injury. mammalian cells express a transport system known as system xc−, which is an exchange agency specific for anionic forms of cystine and glutamate. system xc− activity is important to maintain both intracellular glutathione levels and the redox balance between cystine and cysteine in the extracellular milieu. we have shown that the cloned cdnas encoding the transporter for system xc− consist of two components, xct and the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen. in the present study, we have investigated the mrna distribution for these components in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. the xct mrna was expressed in the area postrema, subfornical organ, habenular nucleus, hypothalamic area, and ependymal cells of the lateral wall of the third ventricle in the adult mouse brain. a strong signal was also detected in the meninges in both adult and fetal mouse brains. the mrna expression of the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xct mrna was detected. these data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xct functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen to elicit system xc− activity. the expression of system xc− in meninges and some circumventricular organs may suggest that this transporter contributes to the maintenance of the redox state (i.e., cysteine/cystine ratio) in the csf.
@background a quantitative examination of the intellectual profile and evolution of information security from 1965 to 2015 despite increasing awareness of the need to trace the trajectory of innovation system research, so far little attention has been given to quantitative depiction of the evolution of this fast-moving research field. this paper uses citespace to demonstrate visually intellectual structures and developments. the study uses citation analysis to detect and visualize disciplinary distributions, keyword co-word networks and journal cocitation networks, highly cited references, as well as highly cited authors to identify intellectual turning points, pivotal points and emerging trends, in innovation systems system research from 1975 to 2012.
@background macular pigment density at the site of altered fundus autofluorescence purpose to image and quantify the spatial distribution of fundus autofluorescence in normal subjects, to determine its age dependence, and to document the deviation from normal in patients with age-related macular disease.   methods using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (clso), the intensity and spatial distribution of fundus autofluorescence was studied in 33 normal subjects, 97 eyes with drusen only, and 111 eyes with visual loss caused by age-related macular disease.   results fundus autofluorescence intensity in normal subjects was highest at the posterior pole and dipped at the fovea. autofluorescence increased with age at the posterior pole. fundus in eyes with age-related maculopathy showed localized high autofluorescence that did not correspond with drusen. linear pigmentation at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe), whether detached or flat, fluoresced brightly, whereas plaques of melanin did not. areas of low and high levels of autofluorescence were seen in lesions containing choroidal new vessels. in areas of geographic atrophy, autofluorescence was low.   conclusions the spatial distribution of background fundus autofluorescence and the correlation of autofluorescence with age in normal subjects imply that autofluorescence is derived from lipofuscin at the level of the rpe. focal accumulation of autofluorescent material occurs at the level of the rpe in patients with drusen, but the drusen do not show marked increases in autofluorescence. it is likely that melanolipofuscin accounts for the high levels of autofluorescence, corresponding to linear pigmentation at the level of the rpe. low-intensity autofluorescence occurs in the presence of retinal photoreceptor loss, and variable levels over disciform lesions probably relate to variations in metabolic activity of the rpe.
@method fiscal policies and credit regimes: a tvar approach: fiscal policies and credit regimes the problem of testing for linearity and the number of regimes in the context of self-exciting threshold autoregressive (setar) models is reviewed. we describe least-squares methods of estimation and inference. the primary complication is that the testing problem is non-standard, due to the presence of parameters which are only defined under the alternative, so the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics is non-standard. simulation methods to calculate asymptotic and bootstrap distributions are presented. as the sampling distributions are quite sensitive to conditional heteroskedasticity in the error, careful modeling of the conditional variance is necessary for accurate inference on the conditional mean. we illustrate these methods with two applications--annual sunspot means and monthly u.s. industrial production. we find that annual sunspots and monthly industrial production are setar(2) processes. copyright 1999 by blackwell publishers ltd

@result neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) predicts response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and clinical outcome in primary human breast cancer neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) is a small, secreted glycoprotein with proposed functions in cell proliferation, survival and morphogenesis. ngal is expressed in a variety of tumor types including breast carcinomas, but it is not known whether ngal contributes directly to breast cancer progression. this study examines the relationship between ngal expression in breast carcinomas and established clinical prognostic markers as well as clinical outcome. using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing well characterized tumor samples from 207 breast cancer patients, ngal was detected in 68 breast carcinomas in a cytoplasmic location. ngal expression correlated strongly with negative steroid receptor status, her-2/neu overexpression, poor histologic grade, the presence of lymph node metastases and a high ki-67 proliferation index. in univariate survival analysis, ngal expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival and decreased disease-free survival in the entire cohort. in multivariate analysis, ngal remained an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival. in a subset of patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors, ngal was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival. the results show that ngal expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in primary human breast cancer and suggest that ngal detection may provide information for risk assessment and identify a subset of patients requiring more aggressive adjuvant therapy.
@background living close to a person with cancer: a review of the international literature and implications for social work practice the current study examined whether adult children of recently diagnosed breast cancer patients experience heightened general and major stressor-related distress, and identified a potential mediator between these two forms of distress. unique from other stress studies, the current study proposed a novel intrapsychic construct, the extent to which one understands and recognizes his or her thoughts and feelings related to a major stressor, for which we coined the term cognitive and emotional coherence. albeit preliminary, findings supported study hypotheses and argue that this construct may represent an important mediator of distress as well as a pivotal target for psychosocial intervention.
@background a preliminary investigation of cognitive appraisal and cardiovascular reactivity and recovery in arab americans. problem/condition the u.s. population continues to diversify, and certain racial/ethnic minorities are growing at a substantially more rapid pace than the majority population. limited large-scale population-based surveys and surveillance systems are designed to monitor the health status of minority populations. the racial and ethnic approaches to community health (reach) 2010 risk factor survey is conducted annually in minority communities in the united states. the survey focuses on four minority populations (blacks, hispanics, asians/pacific islanders [a/pis], and american indians).   reporting period covered 2001-2002.   description of system telephone (n = 18 communities) and face-to-face (n = 3 communities) interviews were conducted in 21 communities located in 14 states (alabama, california, georgia, illinois, louisiana, massachusetts, michigan, new york, north carolina, oklahoma, south carolina, tennessee, texas, and washington). an average of 1,000 minority residents aged >/=18 years in each community was sampled. interviews were administered in english, spanish, vietnamese, khmer, or mandarin chinese. the median response rate for household screenings was 74.0% for households that were reached and 72.0% for family members interviewed. the self-reported data from the community were compared with data derived from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (brfss) for the metropolitan/micropolitan statistical area (mmsa) or the state where the community was located and compared with national estimates from brfss.   results reported education level and household income were markedly lower in minority communities than the general population living in the comparison mmsa or state. more minorities reported being in fair or poor health, but they did not see a doctor because of the cost. substantial variations were observed in the prevalence of health-risk factors and selected chronic conditions among minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic minority. the median prevalence of obesity among a/pi men and women was 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively, whereas 39.2% and 37.5% of american indian men and women were obese, respectively. cigarette smoking was common in american indian communities, with a median of 42.2% for men and 36.7% for women. compared with the national level, fewer minority adults reported eating >/=5 fruits and vegetables daily and met recommendations for moderate or vigorous leisure-time physical activity. american indian communities had a high prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes. a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was also observed in black communities (32.0% and 10.9%, respectively, for men and 40.4% and 14.3%, respectively, for women). compared with the general u.s. population, a substantially lower percentage of hispanics and a/pis had reported receiving preventive services (e.g., cholesterol screenings; glycosylated hemoglobin tests and foot examinations for patients with diabetes; mammograms and papanicolaou smear tests; and vaccination for influenza and pneumonia among adults aged >/=65 years).   interpretation data from the reach 2010 risk factor survey demonstrate that residents in the minority communities bear greater risks for disease compared with the general population living in the same mmsa or state. substantial variations in the prevalence of risk factors, chronic conditions, and use of preventive services among different minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic population provide opportunities for public health interventions. these variations also indicate that different racial/ethnic populations and different communities should have different priorities in eliminating health disparities.   public health actions the continuous surveillance of health status in minority communities is necessary so that culturally sensitive prevention strategies can be tailored to these communities and program interventions evaluated.
@background demanding innovation : the impact of consumer subsidies on solar panel production costs ∗ this paper estimates demand for residential solar photovoltaic (pv) systems using a new approach to address three empirical challenges that often arise with count data: excess zeros, unobserved heterogeneity, and endogeneity of price. our results imply a price elasticity of demand for solar pv systems of −0.65. counterfactual policy simulations indicate that reducing state financial incentives in half would have led to 9% fewer new installations in connecticut in 2014. calculations suggest a subsidy program cost of $364/tco2 assuming solar displaces natural gas. our poisson hurdle approach holds promise for modeling the demand for many new technologies.
@result model of the perception of smiling virtual character social psychological research demonstrates that the same behavior might lead to different evaluations depending on whether it is shown by a man or a woman. with a view to design decisions with regard to virtual humans it is relevant to test whether this pattern also applies to gendered virtual humans. in a 2×2 between subjects experiment we manipulated the rapport agent's gaze behavior and its gender in order to test whether especially female agents are evaluated more negatively when they do not show gender specific immediacy behavior and avoid gazing at the interaction partner. instead of this interaction effect we found two main effects: gaze avoidance was evaluated negatively and female agents were rated more positively than male agents.
@background continuous mild heat stress induces differentiation of mammalian myoblasts, shifting fiber type from fast to slow. satellite cell proliferation was assessed in low-frequency-stimulated hypothyroid rat fast-twitch muscle by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (brdu) labeling and subsequent staining of labeled muscle nuclei, and by staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna). brdu labeling and pcna staining were highly correlated and increased approximately fourfold at 5 days of stimulation, decayed thereafter, but remained elevated over control in 10- and 20-day stimulated muscles. myogenin mrna was approximately 4-fold elevated at 5 days and 1.5-fold at 10 days. staining for myogenin protein yielded results similar to that for pcna and brdu. furthermore, a detailed examination of the pattern of myogenin staining revealed that the number of myogenin-positive nuclei was elevated in the fast pure iib fiber population at 5 and 10 days of chronic low-frequency stimulation. by 20 days, myogenin staining was observed in transforming fast fibers that coexpressed embryonic and adult myosin heavy chain isoforms. in the slower fiber populations (i.e., iia and i), myogenin-positive transforming fibers that coexpressed embryonic myosin heavy chain, appeared already at 5 days. thus the satellite cell progeny on slower fibers seemed to proliferate less and to fuse earlier to their associated fibers than the satellite cell progeny on fast fibers. we suggest that the increase in muscle nuclei of the fast fibers might be a prerequisite for fast-to-slow fiber type transitions.
@background interlimb coordination in patients with parkinson’s disease: motor learning deficits and the importance of augmented information feedback normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or "open-loop" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or "closed-loop" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. in a previous paper it was suggested that parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. in the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. these results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.
@method importance of mangrove carbon for aquatic food webs in wet–dry tropical estuaries background stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology. key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. methodology by accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. conclusions we outline a framework that builds on recently published bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source r package, siar. the formulation in r will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.

@method control of vertebrate core planar cell polarity protein localization and dynamics by prickle 2 planar polarity decisions in the wing of drosophila involve the assembly of asymmetric protein complexes containing the conserved receptor frizzled. in this study, we analyse the role of the van gogh/strabismus gene in the formation of these complexes and cell polarisation. we find that the strabismus protein becomes asymmetrically localised to the proximal edge of cells. in the absence of strabismus activity, the planar polarity proteins dishevelled and prickle are mislocalised in the cell. we show that strabismus binds directly to dishevelled and prickle and is able to recruit them to membranes. furthermore, we demonstrate that the putative pdz-binding motif at the c terminus of strabismus is not required for its function. we propose a two-step model for assembly of frizzledcontaining asymmetric protein complexes at cell boundaries. first, strabismus acts together with frizzled and the atypical cadherin flamingo to mediate apicolateral recruitment of planar polarity proteins including dishevelled and prickle. in the second phase, dishevelled and prickle are required for these proteins to become asymmetrically distributed on the proximodistal axis.
@method tests for the assessment of sport-specific performance in olympic combat sports: a systematic review with practical recommendations performance testing is one of the most common and important measures used in sports science and physiology. performance tests allow for a controlled simulation of sports and exercise performance for research or applied science purposes. there are three factors that contribute to a good performance test: (i) validity; (ii) reliability; and (iii) sensitivity. a valid protocol is one that resembles the performance that is being simulated as closely as possible. when investigating race-type events, the two most common protocols are time to exhaustion and time trials. time trials have greater validity than time to exhaustion because they provide a good physiological simulation of actual performance and correlate with actual performance. sports such as soccer are more difficult to simulate. while shuttle-running protocols such as the loughborough intermittent shuttle test may simulate physiology of soccer using time to exhaustion or distance covered, it is not a valid measure of soccer performance. there is a need to include measures of skill in such protocols. reliability is the variation of a protocol. research has shown that time-to-exhaustion protocols have a coefficient of variation (cv) of >10%, whereas time trials are more reliable as they have been shown to have a cv of <5%. a sensitive protocol is one that is able to detect small, but important, changes in performance. the difference between finishing first and second in a sporting event is <1%. therefore, it is important to be able to detect small changes with performance protocols. a quantitative value of sensitivity may be accomplished through the signal : noise ratio, where the signal is the percentage improvement in performance and the noise is the cv.
@result cell-cycle synchronization of fibroblasts derived from transgenic cloned cattle ear skin: effects of serum starvation, roscovitine and contact inhibition. synchronization of the cell cycle stages in g0/g1 phase is one of the key factors determining the success of nuclear transplantation. serum deprivation, contact inhibition and chemical inhibitors are widely used methods for this purpose. in this study, cell cycle stages of foetal fibroblasts and cumulus cells were determined using flow cytometry [fluorescence-activated cell scan (facs)]. foetal fibroblasts (in vitro cultured for 72-120 h) and fresh cumulus cells were analysed in experiment 1. fifty to 55% proliferating fibroblasts remained in g0/g1 phase compared with 78% in confluent culture (p <0.05). in contrast to foetal fibroblasts, fresh cumulus cells maintained 90% of the population in the g0/g1 stage. when serum was retrieved from the proliferating fibroblasts from day 1 to day 5 (experiment 2), proportions of g0/g1 cells increased from the initial ratio of 53 to 87% at day 4 of starvation, which was significantly higher than the non-starved proliferating cells (p <0.05). in experiment 3, fibroblasts were treated with aphidicolin (0.1 microg/ml, 6 h), demicolcine (0.5 microg/ml, 10 h), or a combination of these two chemicals to synchronize the cell cycle stages. surprisingly, no differences or significantly lower in the proportions of g0/g1)phase cells were detected (25-50%) compared with the uncontrolled growing cells (53%). these results suggested that fresh cumulus cells rest their cell cycle in g0/g1 stage. serum deprivation became effective in the first 24 h and reached the highest proportions during days 4-5 after deprivation. chemical synchronization of the cell cycle stage of rabbit foetal fibroblasts to g0/g1 phase appeared less effective compared to serum deprivation.
@method methodological aspects of cognitive rehabilitation with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) the effects of saccadic bilateral (horizontal) eye movements on memory for a visual event narrative were investigated. in the study phase, participants were exposed to a set of pictures accompanied by a verbal commentary describing the events depicted in the pictures. next, the participants were asked either misleading or control questions about the depicted event and were then asked to engage in 30s of bilateral vs. vertical vs. no eye movements. finally, recognition memory was tested using the remember-know procedure. it was found that bilateral eye movements increased true memory for the event, increased recollection, and decreased the magnitude of the misinformation effect. the findings are discussed in terms of source monitoring, dual-process theories of memory and the potential neural foundations of such effects.
@background a conserved polϵ binding module in ctf18-rfc is required for s-phase checkpoint activation downstream of mec1 the s phase checkpoint pathway preserves genome stability by protecting defective dna replication forks, but the underlying mechanisms are still understood poorly. previous work with budding yeast suggested that the checkpoint kinases mec1 and rad53 might prevent collapse of the replisome when nucleotide concentrations are limiting, thereby allowing the subsequent resumption of dna synthesis. here we describe a direct analysis of replisome stability in budding yeast cells lacking checkpoint kinases, together with a high-resolution view of replisome progression across the genome. surprisingly, we find that the replisome is stably associated with dna replication forks following replication stress in the absence of mec1 or rad53. a component of the replicative dna helicase is phosphorylated within the replisome in a mec1-dependent manner upon replication stress, and our data indicate that checkpoint kinases control replisome function rather than stability, as part of a multifaceted response that allows cells to survive defects in chromosome replication.
@method on the distribution of edges in random regular graphs we prove that for every constant δ>0 the chromatic number of the random graphg(n, p) withp=n−1/2−δ is asymptotically almost surely concentrated in two consecutive values. this implies that for any β<1/2 and any integer valued functionr(n)≤o(nβ) there exists a functionp(n) such that the chromatic number ofg(n,p(n)) is preciselyr(n) asymptotically almost surely.
@method exclusionary interactions among diverse fungi infecting developing seeds of centaurea stoebe. fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
@background spatio-temporal cellular dynamics of the arabidopsis flagellin receptor reveal activation status-dependent endosomal sorting[c][w] actin and myosin are components of plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic channels between plant cells, but their role in regulating these channels is unclear. here, we investigated the role of myosin in regulating plasmodesmata in a well-studied, simple system comprising single filaments of cells which form stamen hairs in tradescantia virginiana flowers. effects of myosin inhibitors were assessed by analysing cell-to-cell movement of fluorescent tracers microinjected into treated cells. incubation in the myosin inhibitor, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (bdm) or injection of anti-myosin antibodies increased cell–cell transport of fluorescent dextrans, while treatment with the myosin inhibitor n-ethylmaleimide (nem) decreased cell–cell transport. pretreatment with the callose synthesis inhibitor, deoxy-d-glucose (ddg), enhanced transport induced by bdm treatment or injection of myosin antibodies but did not relieve nem-induced reduction in transport. in contrast to the myosin inhibitors, cell-to-cell transport was unaffected by treatment with the actin polymerisation inhibitor, latrunculin b, after controlling for callose synthesis with ddg. transport was increased following azide treatment, and reduced after injection of atp, as in previous studies. we propose that myosin detachment from actin, induced by bdm, opens t. virginiana plasmodesmata whereas the firm attachment of myosin to actin, promoted by nem, closes them.
@method bhlhb2 controls bdnf promoter 4 activity and neuronal excitability drugs of abuse cause activation of the cyclic amp response element binding protein (creb) in the nucleus accumbens (nac). expression of active creb in rat nac medium spiny neurons (msns) increased their excitability, whereas dominant-negative creb had the opposite effect. decreasing excitability of nac msns in vivo by overexpression of potassium channels enhanced locomotor responses to cocaine, suggesting that the increased nac msn excitability caused by creb helped to limit behavioral sensitivity to cocaine.
@method descriptive study of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza during five epidemic seasons (2010–2015) background the global burden of disease attributable to seasonal influenza virus in children is unknown. we aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from lower respiratory infections associated with influenza in children younger than 5 years.   methods we estimated the incidence of influenza episodes, influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infections (alri), and influenza-associated severe alri in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, with data from a systematic review of studies published between jan 1, 1995, and oct 31, 2010, and 16 unpublished population-based studies. we applied these incidence estimates to global population estimates for 2008 to calculate estimates for that year. we estimated possible bounds for influenza-associated alri mortality by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based reports and identifying studies with population-based data for influenza seasonality and monthly alri mortality.   findings we identified 43 suitable studies, with data for around 8 million children. we estimated that, in 2008, 90 million (95% ci 49-162 million) new cases of influenza (data from nine studies), 20 million (13-32 million) cases of influenza-associated alri (13% of all cases of paediatric alri; data from six studies), and 1 million (1-2 million) cases of influenza-associated severe alri (7% of cases of all severe paediatric alri; data from 39 studies) occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years. we estimated there were 28,000-111,500 deaths in children younger than 5 years attributable to influenza-associated alri in 2008, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any one setting.   interpretation influenza is a common pathogen identified in children with alri and results in a substantial burden on health services worldwide. sufficient data to precisely estimate the role of influenza in childhood mortality from alri are not available.   funding who; bill & melinda gates foundation.
@background trends in the hiv epidemic among african american men who have sex with men, san francisco, 2004–2011 understanding infectious disease dynamics and the effect on prevalence and incidence is crucial for public health policies. disease incidence and prevalence are typically not observed directly and increasingly are estimated through the synthesis of indirect information from multiple data sources. we demonstrate how an evidence synthesis approach to the estimation of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) prevalence in england and wales can be extended to infer the underlying hiv incidence. diverse time series of data can be used to obtain yearly “snapshots” (with associated uncertainty) of the proportion of the population in 4 compartments: not at risk, susceptible, hiv positive but undiagnosed, and diagnosed hiv positive. a multistate model for the infection and diagnosis processes is then formulated by expressing the changes in these proportions by a system of differential equations. by parameterizing incidence in terms of prevalence and contact rates, hiv transmission is further modeled. use of additional data or prior information on demographics, risk behavior change and contact parameters allows simultaneous estimation of the transition rates, compartment prevalences, contact rates, and transmission probabilities.
@background pupillary function in early multiple sclerosis there is evidence that the clinical course of multiple sclerosis is age related. the present study evaluated the relationship between age and rate of disability progression in a large hospital‐based cohort of definite cases of multiple sclerosis (n= 1,463). patients were followed every 6 to 12 months for a total period of observation of 11,387.8 person‐years. expanded disability status scale scores increased significantly with increasing current age and longer duration of disease (p=0.007). median times to reach expanded disability status scale scores of 4.0 and 6.0, assessed using an extended kaplan–meier method with age as a categorical time‐varying covariate, were significantly longer among patients aged 20 to 35 years compared with patients aged 36 to 50 and 51 to 65 years (p < 0.0001). significant associations were observed between mean expanded disability status scale scores and age at disease onset, current age, and the interaction of age at disease onset and current age (p < 0.001). current age had a greater effect (59% of variability in the model) on disease severity than did age at disease onset. furthermore, a multiplicative effect on expanded disability status scale score was observed for age at disease onset and current age combined, indicating a faster rate of disease progression in older patients. in conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate the impact of age on rate of disability progression in multiple sclerosis and suggest that an age‐adjusted progression index may be a more relevant criterion for defining differences between multiple sclerosis groups.
@result the interaction of process and domain in prefrontal cortex during inductive reasoning despite the recent interest in the neuroanatomy of inductive reasoning processes, the regional specificity within prefrontal cortex (pfc) for the different mechanisms involved in induction tasks remains to be determined. in this study, we used fmri to investigate the contribution of pfc regions to rule acquisition (rule search and rule discovery) and rule following. twenty-six healthy young adult participants were presented with a series of images of cards, each consisting of a set of circles numbered in sequence with one colored blue. participants had to predict the position of the blue circle on the next card. the rules that had to be acquired pertained to the relationship among succeeding stimuli. responses given by subjects were categorized in a series of phases either tapping rule acquisition (responses given up to and including rule discovery) or rule following (correct responses after rule acquisition). mid-dorsolateral pfc (mid-dlpfc) was active during rule search and remained active until successful rule acquisition. by contrast, rule following was associated with activation in temporal, motor, and medial/anterior prefrontal cortex. moreover, frontopolar cortex (fpc) was active throughout the rule acquisition and rule following phases before a rule became familiar. we attributed activation in mid-dlpfc to hypothesis generation and in fpc to integration of multiple separate inferences. the present study provides evidence that brain activation during inductive reasoning involves a complex network of frontal processes and that different subregions respond during rule acquisition and rule following phases.
@background monitoring response and resistance to the novel arsenical darinaparsin in an aml patient one of the genes associated with both murine and human myeloid leukemia is evi1 (ecotropic viral integration 1 site). evi1 was first identified as a common locus of retroviral integration in myeloid tumors found in akxd mice. the exact mechanism by which evi1 induces leukemogenesis is not clear. studies of the function of evi1 in the bone marrow and in cell lines have shown that the inappropriate expression of evi1 prohibits terminal differentiation of the bone marrow progenitor cells in granulocytes and erythroid cells, but strongly favors hematopoietic differentiation along the megakaryocytic lineage. we summarize recent data showing that evi1 is a complex transcription factor with multiple functions, and this complexity is further demonstrated by the ability of evi1 to interact with coactivators and corepressors and to abrogate cellular response to cytokines.
@result verbal memory and visual perception in early alzheimer’s disease: contribution of new diagnostic tools for new classification criteria the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild alzheimer's disease (ad). the present study investigates the relationships between performance on fcsrt and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural mri in patients with ad. three complementary mri-based analyses (vbm analysis, roi-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with ad to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the fcsrt. with vbm analysis, the total score on the fcsrt was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. in addition, using roi-based analysis, the total recall score on the fcsrt was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. with three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the ca1 field. no correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. in ad, the fcsrt may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the ca1 field of the hippocampus.
@method testing common habitat-based surrogates of invertebrate diversity in a semi-arid rangeland a procedure for the implementation of quality control for laboratorysorting and identification of invertebrate specimens collected in biodiversityresearch is described. the procedure is based on process control sampling, aconcept of statistical process control (spc) used widely in the manufacturingand information technology industries, and adapted to suit the tasks andproducts of biodiversity sorting procedures. the major advantages of processcontrol over other quality control mechanisms are that it is more stringent, andcontinuous. hence, errors are detected and corrected as they occur, avoidingproliferation in the data set. the procedure is also highly interactive,offering the technicians the opportunity to learn as they work. protocols havebeen developed while sorting material collected as part of a study into theimpacts associated with invasion of a habitat (coastal heath) by an exotic weed(bitou bush – chrysanthemoides monilifera) on thecentral coast of new south wales, australia. major findings from the analysis ofmaterial processed include: that errors may have a variety of causes andsubsequent implications for data quality, levels of identification errors can besignificant even at higher taxonomic levels (e.g. sorting insects to order),initial training periods on their own are insufficient to ensure errorminimisation, and even with stringent protocols the ratio of technician tospecialist effort can be maintained at a level of around 5:1. the need forincorporating effective quality control procedures into invertebratebiodiversity data compilations is emphasised.
@result timing matters: long term effects of adversities from prenatal period up to adolescence on adolescents’ cortisol stress response. the trails study background animal models have linked early maternal separation with lifelong changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (hpa) axis activity. although this is paralleled in human studies, this is often in the context of other life adversities, for example, divorce or adoption, and it is not known whether early separation in the absence of these factors has long term effects on the hpa axis.   aims the finnish experience in world war ii created a natural experiment to test whether separation from a father serving in the armed forces or from both parents due to war evacuation are associated with alterations in hpa axis response to psychosocial stress in late adulthood.   method 282 subjects (m=63.5 years, sd=2.5), of whom 85 were non-separated, 129 were separated from their father, and 68 were separated from both their caregivers during wwii, were enlisted to participate in a trier social stress test (tsst), during which we measured salivary cortisol and, for 215 individuals, plasma cortisol and acth concentrations. we used mixed models to study whether parental separation is associated with salivary and plasma cortisol or plasma acth reactivity, and linear regressions to analyse differences in the baseline, or incremental area under the cortisol or acth curves.   results participants separated from their father did not differ significantly from non-separated participants. however, those separated from both parents had higher average salivary cortisol and plasma acth concentrations across all time points compared to the non-separated group. they also had higher salivary cortisol reactivity to the tsst. separated women had higher baselines in plasma cortisol and acth, whereas men had higher reactivity in response to stress during the tsst. participants who had experienced the separation in early childhood were more affected than children separated during infancy or school age.   conclusions separation from parents during childhood may alter an individual's stress physiology much later in adult life.
@background diffusion mri microstructure models with in vivo human brain connectome data: results from a multi‐group comparison this paper compares a range of compartment models for diffusion mri data on in vivo human acquisitions from a standard 60mt/m system (philips 3t achieva) and a unique 300mt/m system (siemens connectom). the key aim is to determine whether both systems support broadly the same models or whether the connectom higher gradient system supports significantly more complex models. a single volunteer underwent 8h of acquisition on each system to provide uniquely wide and dense sampling of the available space of pulsed-gradient spin-echo (pgse) measurements. we select a set of promising models from the wide set of possible three-compartment models for in vivo white matter (wm) that previous work and preliminary experiments suggest as strong candidates, but extend them to fit for compartmental t2 and diffusivity. we focus on the corpus callosum where the wm fibre architecture is simplest and compare their ability to explain the measured data, using akaike's information criterion (aic), and to predict unseen data, using cross-validation. we also compare the stability of parameter estimates in the presence of i) noise, using bootstrapping, and ii) spatial variation, using visual assessment and comparison with anatomical knowledge. broadly similar models emerge from the aic and cross-validation experiments in both data sets. specifically, a three-compartment model consisting of either a bingham distribution of sticks or a cylinder for the intracellular compartment, an anisotropic diffusion tensor (dt) model for the extracellular compartment, as well as an isotropic csf compartment, performs consistently well. however, various other models also perform well and no single model emerges as clear winner. the wm data (with virtually no csf contamination) do not support compartmental t2 but partially support compartmental diffusivity. evaluation of parameter stability favours simpler models than those identified by aic or cross-validation. they suggest that the level of complexity in models underpinning currently popular microstructure imaging techniques such as noddi, charmed, or activeax, where the number of free parameters is about 4 or 5 rather than 10 or 11, may reflect the level of complexity achievable for a useful technique on current systems, although the 300mt/m data may support more complex models.
@background calreticulin localizes to plant intra/extracellular peripheries of highly specialized cells involved in pollen-pistil interactions using a polyclonal antibody raised against calreticulin purified and sequenced from maize, we performed an immunocytological study to characterize putative domain-specific subcellular distributions of endoplasmic reticulum (er)-resident calreticulin in meristematic cells of maize root tip. at the light microscopy level, calreticulin was immunolocalized preferentially at cellular peripheries, in addition to nuclear envelopes and cytoplasmic structures. punctate labelling at the longitudinal walls and continuous labelling at the transverse walls was characteristic. immunogold electron microscopy revealed plasmodesmata as the most prominently labelled cell periphery structure. in order to further probe the er-domain-specific distribution of maize calreticulin at plasmodesmata, root apices were exposed to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. plasmolysis was associated with prominent accumulations of calreticulin at callose-enriched plasmodesmata and pit fields while the contracting protoplasts were depleted of calreticulin. in contrast, other er-resident proteins recognized by hdel peptide and bip antibodies localized exclusively to contracted protoplasts. this finding reveals that, in plasmolysed cells, calreticulin enriched er domains at plasmodesmata and pit fields are depleted of other er-resident proteins containing the hdel retention peptide.
@background swarm algorithms with chaotic jumps applied to noisy optimization problems particle swarm optimization has become a common heuristic technique in the optimization community, with many researchers exploring the concepts, issues, and applications of the algorithm. in spite of this attention, there has as yet been no standard definition representing exactly what is involved in modern implementations of the technique. a standard is defined here which is designed to be a straightforward extension of the original algorithm while taking into account more recent developments that can be expected to improve performance on standard measures. this standard algorithm is intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent pso to the wider optimization community
@method drivers with parkinson’s disease: are the symptoms of pd associated with restricted driving practices? cognitive impairment is common in parkinson's disease (pd) and can occur early in the disease course. no effective screening test exists for detection of early or mild cognitive impairment in pd. we examined the montreal cognitive assessment (moca) as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in pd. the test–retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.79 and the interrater intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81. the correlation coefficient between the moca and a neuropsychologic battery was 0.72. the moca is reliable and valid in the pd population and warrants further study as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction. © 2008 movement disorder society
@method projecting global marine biodiversity impacts under climate change scenarios global climate change is recognized as an important determining factor for the future distributions of marine organisms, notably fishes and invertebrates. shifting of distribution range may affect global marine fisheries and have large socio-economic implications. however, globalscale evaluation of the impact of climate change on marine species is lacking. in this paper, we develop a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict the effect of climate change on the distributions of marine species with emphasis on commercially exploited fishes and invertebrates. first, the model infers, for various species, bioclimate envelopes based on their current distribution. bioclimate envelopes are defined by sea water temperature, bathymetry, habitats and distance from sea ice. secondly, the model predicts the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes induced by changes in climate variables. simultaneously, following the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes, the model simulates movement of relative abundance through changes in population growth, mortality, larval dispersal and adult movement. we test the model with several commercially exploited fish species with widely different biogeography. the model provides reasonable and robust predictions of future distribution ranges of the four species under different scenarios of sea water warming. moreover, the predictions are robust to major model assumptions and parameter uncertainty. using realistic climate change predictions from the noaa/gfdl coupled model, this model will be used to evaluate impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries. introduction there is ample evidence from empirical observations and climate models indicating that mean global temperatures have been increasing over the last 100 years (ipcc 2007). global temperature has increased by over 0.6 oc since 1900 and it may continue to increase at a rate of around 0.2 oc per decade (ipcc 2007). biological responses to this change have been observed in both terrestrial and marine biomes (murawski 1993; hughes 2000; mccarty 2001; parmesan & yohe 2003; perry et al. 2005; hobday et al. 2006). the responses include changes in physiology (e.g. productivity), geographic range and phenology at population, species, community and ecosystem levels (hughes 2000; mccarty 2001). for instance, nearly two-thirds of marine fishes in the north sea shifted in mean latitude or depth or both over 25 years as sea temperature increased (perry et al. 2005). during the last century, annual growth rates for the juveniles of eight long-lived fish species in the southwest pacific increased in shallow waters and decreased in deep waters where ocean warming and cooling occurred, respectively (thresher et al 2007). this agrees with the quantitative model of fish physiology, which predicts increasing growth performance and fecundity in higher latitude and the converse in lower latitude as sea 1 cited as: cheung, w.w.l., lam, v.w.y., pauly, d. 2008. dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict climate-induced changes in distribution of marine fishes and invertebrates, p. 5-50. in: cheung, w.w.l, lam, v.w.y., pauly, d.

@background adaptive clustering for coreference resolution with deterministic rules and web-based language models most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
@background crystal structure and dynamics of a lipid-induced potential desensitized-state of a pentameric ligand-gated channel the nicotinic acetylcholine (ach) receptor converts transiently to an open-channel form when activated by ach released into the synaptic cleft. we describe here the conformational change underlying this event, determined by electron microscopy of ach-sprayed and freeze-trapped postsynaptic membranes. ach binding to the α subunits triggers a concerted rearrangement in the ligand-binding domain, involving an ~ 1‐å outward displacement of the extracellular portion of the β subunit where it interacts with the juxtaposed ends of α-helices shaping the narrow membrane-spanning pore. the β-subunit helices tilt outward to accommodate this displacement, destabilising the arrangement of pore-lining helices, which in the closed channel bend inward symmetrically to form a central hydrophobic gate. straightening and tangential motion of the pore-lining helices effect channel opening by widening the pore asymmetrically and increasing its polarity in the region of the gate. the pore-lining helices of the αγ and δ subunits, by flexing between alternative bent and straight conformations, undergo the greatest movements. this coupled allosteric transition shifts the structure from a tense (closed) state toward a more relaxed (open) state.
@background neuro-inflammatory risk factors for treatment failure in “early second stage” sleeping sickness patients treated with pentamidine the committee of the european concerted action for multiple sclerosis (charcot foundation) organised five workshops to discuss csf analytical standards in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. this consensus report from 12 european countries summarises the results of those workshops. it is hoped that neurologists will confer with their colleagues in clinical chemistry to arrange the best possible local practice. the most sensitive method for the detection of oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands is isoelectric focusing. the same amounts of igg in parallel csf and serum samples are used and oligoclonal bands are revealed with igg specific antibody staining. all laboratories performing isoelectric focusing should check their technique at least annually using “blind” standards for the five different csf and serum patterns. quantitative measurements of igg production in the cns are less sensitive than isoelectric focusing. the preferred method for detection of blood-csf barrier dysfunction is the albumin quotient. the csf albumin or total protein concentrations are less satisfactory. these results must be interpreted with reference to the age of the patient and the local method of determination. cells should be counted. the normal value is no more than 4 cells/microliters. among evolving optional tests, measurement of the combined local synthesis of antibodies against measles, rubella, and/or varicella zoster could represent a significant advance if it offers higher specificity (not sensitivity) for identifying chronic rather than acute inflammation. other tests that may have useful correlations with clinical indices include those for oligoclonal free light chains, igm, iga, or myelin basic protein concentrations.
@background lack of character displacement in the male recognition molecule, bindin, in altantic sea urchins of the genus echinometra. bindin is a gamete recognition protein known to control species-specific sperm-egg adhesion and membrane fusion in sea urchins. previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. the present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of echinometra in central america: e. lucunter and e. viridis from the caribbean, and e. vanbrunti from the eastern pacific. the eggs of e. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. as in the indo-west pacific (iwp) echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the iwp species. maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of e. lucunter. we analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the e. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the american echinometra. instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.
@background extracellular vesicle-packaged mirna release after short-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with increased coagulation elevated levels of fibrinogen are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas low fibrinogen can lead to a bleeding disorder. we investigated whether micrornas (mirnas), known to act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, regulate fibrinogen production. using transfection of a library of 470 annotated human mirna precursor molecules in huh7 hepatoma cells and quantitative measurements of fibrinogen production, we identified 23 mirnas with down-regulating (up to 64% decrease) and 4 with up-regulating effects (up to 129% increase) on fibrinogen production. among the down-regulating mirnas, we investigated the mechanism of action of 3 hsa-mir-29 family members and hsa-mir-409-3p. overexpression of hsa-mir-29 members led to decreased steady-state levels of all fibrinogen gene (fga, fgb, and fgg) transcripts in huh7 cells. luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that this was independent of mirna-fibrinogen 3'-untranslated region interactions. in contrast, overexpression of hsa-mir-409-3p specifically lowered fibrinogen bβ mrna levels, and this effect was dependent on a target site in the fibrinogen bβ mrna 3'-untranslated region. this study adds to the known mechanisms that control fibrinogen production, points toward a potential cause of variable circulating fibrinogen levels, and demonstrates that a screening approach can identify mirnas that regulate clinically important proteins.
@result potential for anthropogenic disturbances to influence evolutionary change in the life history of a threatened salmonid salmonine fishes are commonly subjected to strong, novel selective pressures due to anthropogenic activities and global climate change, often resulting in population extinction. consequently, there is considerable interest in predicting the long‐term evolutionary trajectories of extant populations. knowledge of the genetic architecture of fitness traits is integral to making these predictions. we reviewed the published, peer‐reviewed literature for estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for fitness traits in salmonine fishes with two broad goals in mind: summarization of published data and testing for differences among categorical variables (e.g., species, life history type, experimental conditions). balanced coverage of variables was lacking and estimates for wild populations and behavioral traits were nearly absent. distributions of heritability estimates were skewed toward low values and distributions of genetic correlations toward large, positive values, suggesting that significant potential for evolution of traits exists. furthermore, experimental conditions had a direct effect on h2 estimates, and other variables had more complex effects on h2 and rg estimates, suggesting that available estimates may be insufficient for use in models to predict evolutionary change in wild populations. given this and other inherent complicating factors, making accurate predictions of the evolutionary trajectories of salmonine fishes will be a difficult task.
@background synergism between dexketoprofen and meloxicam in an orofacial formalin test was not modified by opioid antagonists. summarydexketoprofen trometamol is a water-soluble salt of the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) ketoprofen. racemic ketoprofen is used as an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent, and is one of the most potent in vitro inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. this effect is due to the s(+)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen), while the r(−)-enantiomer is devoid of such activity.the pharmacokinetic profile of ketoprofen and its enantiomers was assessed in several animal species and in human volunteers. in humans, the relative bioavailability of oral dexketoprofen trometamol (12.5 and 25mg, respectively) is similar to that of oral racemic ketoprofen (25 and 50mg, respectively), as measured in all cases by the area under the concentration-time curve values for s(+)-ketoprofen. dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the tmax for the s-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/l are reached after administration of dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25mg, respectively.from 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. no r(−)-ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of dexketoprofen [s(+)-ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the s(+)-enantiomer in humans.in animal studies, the anti-inflammatory potency of dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of ketoprofen. similarly, animal studies showed a high analgesic potency for dexketoprofen trometamol. the r(−)-enantiomer demonstrated a much lower potency, its analgesic action being apparent only in conditions where the metabolic bioinversion to the s(+)-enantiomer was significant.the gastric ulcerogenic effects of dexketoprofen at various oral doses (1.5 to 6 mg/kg) in the rat do not differ from those of the corresponding double doses (3 to 12 mg/kg) of racemic ketoprofen. repeated (5-day) oral administration of dexketoprofen as the trometamol salt causes less gastric ulceration than was observed after the acid form of both dexketoprofen and the racemate. in addition, single dose dexketoprofen as the free acid at 10 or 20 mg/kg does not show a significant intestinal ulcerogenic effect in rats, while racemic ketoprofen 20 or 40 mg/kg is clearly ulcerogenic to the small intestine.the analgesic efficacy of oral dexketoprofen trometamol 10 and 20mg is superior to that of placebo and similar to that of ibuprofen 400mg in patients with moderate to severe pain after third molar extraction. the time to onset of pain relief appeared to be shorter in patients treated with dexketoprofen trometamol than in those treated with ibuprofen 400mg. dexketoprofen trometamol was well tolerated, with a reported incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo.
@result tissue-specific responses to loss of transglutaminase 2 we previously used subtractive hybridization to isolate cdnas for genes upregulated in chick hypertrophic chondrocytes (nurminskaya, m., and t.f. linsenmayer. 1996. dev. dyn. 206:260–271). certain of these showed homology with the “a” subunit of human plasma transglutaminase (factor xiiia), a member of a family of enzymes that cross-link a variety of intracellular and matrix molecules. we now have isolated a full-length cdna for this molecule, and confirmed that it is avian factor xiiia. northern and enzymatic analyses confirm that the molecule is upregulated in hypertrophic chondrocytes (as much as eightfold). the enzymatic analyses also show that appreciable transglutaminase activity in the hypertrophic zone becomes externalized into the extracellular matrix. this externalization most likely is effected by cell death and subsequent lysis—effected by the transglutaminase itself. when hypertrophic chondrocytes are transfected with a cdna construct encoding the zymogen of factor xiiia, the cells convert the translated protein to a lower molecular weight form, and they initiate cell death, become permeable to macromolecules and eventually undergo lysis. non-hypertrophic cells transfected with the same construct do not show these degenerative changes. these results suggest that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a novel, tissue-specific cascade of mechanisms that upregulate the synthesis of plasma transglutaminase and activate its zymogen. this produces autocatalytic cell death, externalization of the enzyme, and presumably cross-linking of components within the hypertrophic matrix. these changes may in turn regulate the removal and/or calcification of this hypertrophic matrix, which are its ultimate fates.
@method gtfold: enabling parallel rna secondary structure prediction on multi-core desktops a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of rna secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. to demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5s rrna in both escherichia coli and candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. the percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3% to 86.8% for the e. coli sequence by using modification constraints. for c. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5% both with and without modification data. on average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67% to 76%. this enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. for these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28% to 78%. for the 11 sequences with <6% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84% of known canonical base pairs.
@method regulatory sequences of orthologous petd chloroplast mrnas are highly specific among chlamydomonas species in the green unicellular alga chlamydomonas eugametos, cellular division is readily synchronized by light/dark cycles. under these conditions, light initiates photosynthetic growth in daughter cells and begins the g1 phase. genes whose expression is regulated upon illumination are likely to be important mechanisms controlling cell proliferation. to identify some of those genes, two cdna libraries were prepared with poly(a)+ extracted from cells either stimulated with light for 1 h or held in darkness (quiescent cells) during the same period. to restrict our analysis to those genes that are part of the primary response, cells were incubated in presence of cycloheximide. differential screening of approximately 40 000 clones in each library revealed 44 clones which hybridize preferentially with a [32p] cdna probe derived from rna of light-stimulated cells and 15 clones which react selectively with a [32p] cdna probe synthesized from poly(a)+ rna of quiescent cells. cross-hybridization of these clones identified 4 independent sequences in the light-induced (li) collection and 2 in the uninduced (lr) library. four of these cdnas correspond to mrnas that are positively or negatively regulated upon activation of photosynthesis. one clone represents a mrna that accumulates transitorily at both transitions. finally, li818 cdna identifies a new chlorophyll a/b-binding (cab) gene family whose mrna accumulation is controlled by light and a circadian oscillator. the endogenous timing system controls li818 mrna accumulation so that it precedes the onset of illumination by a few hours. on the other hand, light affects li818 mrna levels independently of active photosynthesis.
@result evaluation of 1-year-old children development in isfahan city and its effective factors using ages and stages questionnaire, in 2014 the number of children at risk for delays in motor and social development (msd) associated with preterm delivery and low birthweight is increasing, but such children are generally not seen as being in need of evaluation. the objective of these analyses was to determine whether there are independent effects of birthweight and gestational age on msd and the magnitude of effects. subjects were a representative sample of 4621 us-born singleton children, aged 2-47 months, examined in the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-94). msd was assessed using an age-appropriate scale. birthweight and gestational age were taken from birth certificates. mexican-american and 'other' race/ethnicity (other than non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black or mexican-american), low parental education level, older maternal age, higher birth order, low birthweight (lbw, <2500 g) and preterm delivery (<37 weeks) were all found to be associated with significant (p < 0.01) delays in msd. three per cent of the infants and children were preterm lbw and 2.2% term lbw (<2500 g, 37-44 weeks). adjusting for socio-demographic factors, preterm lbw children had lower msd scores (-1.5 +/- 0.3 points, p < 0.0001) through early childhood, as did term lbw children (0.8 +/- 0.4 points, p < 0.03). for females, lbw was the most important perinatal predictor of a lowered score (-0.9 +/- 0.3 points compared with normal birthweight, p < 0.04). for males, scores were additionally decreased by -0.1 +/- 0.03 points/week (p=0.001) of early delivery. lbw children had less muscle mass, but adjusting for muscularity did not diminish the effects of birth size on msd. lbw status and preterm delivery are associated independently with small, but measurable, delays in msd through early childhood and should be considered along with other known risk factors for development delays in determining the need for developmental evaluation.
@background the role of fat emulsion therapy in a rodent model of propranolol toxicity: a preliminary study amphotericin b (amb) remains the gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. however, the efficacy is limited, with response rates from 10% to 80%. moreover, amb is toxic, especially for the kidneys. new formulations have been developed in an attempt to improve both efficacy and tolerability. in an attempt to reduce toxicity, a number of investigators have reconstituted amb in a lipid emulsion, but few data are available on efficacy in documented infections. an improvement in immediate and renal tolerance was obtained with equivalent daily dose regimens, but the therapeutic index does not appear to be improved. this approach cannot be recommended at present. three lipid formulations have been developed and are now available in most countries: amb colloidal dispersion (abcd), amb lipid complex (ablc), and liposomal amb (ambisome). the efficacy of abcd on various fungal infections has been assessed in open trials, with a response rate of 49% in aspergillosis, 70% in candidiasis, and 67% in mucormycosis. in two randomized trials comparing abcd with amb in invasive aspergillosis and in persistent febrile neutropenia, the response rates were equivalent. abcd was less nephrotoxic. in contrast, immediate reactions to abcd were as frequent and severe as with amb. these immediate effects are more frequent during the first infusions and lessen as treatment continues. the recommended dose is 3–4 mg/kg/day. ablc appeared to be effective as rescue therapy in various types of invasive mycoses, with a response rate of 42% in aspergillosis, 67% in candidiasis, and 82% in fusariosis. efficacy identical to that of amb was demonstrated in a comparative randomized trial involving patients with invasive candidiasis. general and renal tolerability is improved compared with amb. the recommended dose regimen is 5 mg/kg/day. liposomal amb (ambisome) is the only truly liposomal formulation. the response rates in preliminary trials were 66% in aspergillosis and 81% in candidiasis. several comparative studies have confirmed that this formulation has similar or superior efficacy relative to amb in various fungal infections and also in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. renal and general tolerability is excellent. the optimal dosing remains unclear but is generally between 3 and 5 mg/kg/day. a double‐blind trial comparing the tolerance of liposomal amb and ablc demonstrated that both infusion‐related events and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower for liposomal amb. in sum, the new lipid formulations of amb are effective in various invasive fungal infections. the three formulations exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity compared with conventional amb. large‐scale comparative clinical trials may clarify issues of relative efficacy in various forms of mycotic infections. note
@method gper: a new tool to protect dopaminergic neurons? parkinson’s disease (pd) is characterised by the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurones from the substantia nigra (sn) that leads to the hallmark motor disturbances. animal and human studies suggest a beneficial effect of oestrogen to the nigrostriatal system, and the regulation of neurotrophic factor expression by oestrogens has been suggested as a possible mechanism contributing to that neuroprotective effect. the present study was designed to investigate whether the neuroprotection exerted by 17β‐oestradiol on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones is mediated through the regulation of glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) expression. using an in vivo rat model of pd, we were able to confirm the relevance of 17β‐oestradiol in defending dopaminergic neurones against 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐ohda) toxicity. 17β‐oestradiol, released by micro‐osmotic pumps, implanted 10 days before intrastriatal 6‐ohda injection, prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurones induced by 6‐ohda. 17β‐oestradiol treatment also promoted an increase in gdnf protein levels both in the sn and striatum. to explore the relevance of gdnf increases to 17β‐oestradiol neuroprotection, we analysed, in sn neurone‐glia cultures, the effect of gdnf antibody neutralisation and rna interference‐mediated gdnf knockdown. the results showed that both gdnf neutralisation and gdnf silencing abolished the dopaminergic protection provided by 17β‐oestradiol against 6‐ohda toxicity. taken together, these results strongly identify gdnf as an important player in 17β‐oestradiol‐mediated dopaminergic neuroprotection.
@background gene regulatory evolution during speciation in a songbird genetic changes affecting gene expression contribute to phenotypic divergence; thus, understanding how regulatory networks controlling gene expression change over time is critical for understanding evolution. prior studies of expression differences within and between species have identified properties of regulatory divergence, but technical and biological differences among these studies make it difficult to assess the generality of these properties or to understand how regulatory changes accumulate with divergence time. here, we address these issues by comparing gene expression among strains and species of drosophila with a range of divergence times and use f1 hybrids to examine inheritance patterns and disentangle cis- and trans-regulatory changes. we find that the fixation of compensatory changes has caused the regulation of gene expression to diverge more rapidly than gene expression itself. specifically, we observed that the proportion of genes with evidence of cis-regulatory divergence has increased more rapidly with divergence time than the proportion of genes with evidence of expression differences. surprisingly, the amount of expression divergence explained by cis-regulatory changes did not increase steadily with divergence time, as was previously proposed. rather, one species (drosophila sechellia) showed an excess of cis-regulatory divergence that we argue most likely resulted from positive selection in this lineage. taken together, this work reveals not only the rate at which gene expression evolves, but also the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this evolution.
@background functional analysis of nuclear localization signals in vp1-2 homologues from all herpesvirus subfamilies abstract the herpes simplex virus (hsv) tegument protein vp1-2 is essential for virus entry and assembly. vp1-2 also contains a highly conserved ubiquitin-specific protease (usp) domain within its n-terminal region. despite conservation of the usp and the demonstration that it can act on artificial substrates such as polyubiquitin chains, identification of the relevance of the usp in vivo to levels or function of any substrate remains limited. here we show that hsv vp1-2 usp can act on itself and is important for stability. vp1-2 n-terminal variants encompassing the core usp domain itself were not affected by mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue (c65). however, extending the n-terminal region resulted in protein species requiring usp activity for accumulation. in this context, c65a mutation resulted in a drastic reduction in protein levels which could be stabilized by proteosomal inhibition or by the presence of normal c65. the functional usp domain could increase abundance of unstable variants, indicating action at least in part, in trans. interestingly, full-length variants containing the inactive usp, although unstable when expressed in isolation, were stabilized by virus infection. the catalytically inactive vp1-2 retained complementation activity of a vp1-2-negative virus. furthermore, a recombinant virus expressing a c65a mutant vp1-2 exhibited little difference in single-step growth curves and the kinetics and abundance of vp1-2 or a number of test proteins. despite the absence of a phenotype for these replication parameters, the usp activity of vp1-2 may be required for function, including its own stability, under certain circumstances.
@background production and function of il-12 in islets and beta cells to analyze the function of the th1-promoting cytokine il-12 in vivo, we generated transgenic (tg) mice (rip-il12 mice) whose pancreatic beta cells constitutively express bioactive il-12 or one of its components, p35 or p40. in contrast to non-tg littermates or single-tg rip-p35 and rip-p40 mice, rip-il12 mice developed a marked pancreatic infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, mainly around islets. expression of bioactive il-12 primarily upregulated transcript levels of ifn-inducible protein-10 (ip-10), rantes, ifn-gamma, and tnf-alpha in the pancreas. despite the substantial recruitment of mononuclear cells, no biochemical or clinical disease was evident in the exocrine or endocrine pancreas. coexpression of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv) proteins with il-12 in the beta cells failed to spontaneously activate or expand antigen-specific anti-self/viral t cells in uninfected tg animals. however, when rip-il12 x rip-lcmv tg mice were infected with lcmv, antigen-specific anti-self/viral t cells were induced, which led to an acceleration in the kinetics and severity of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm). thus, the ectopic expression of il-12 does not spontaneously break tolerance and activate antigen-specific t cells in the periphery, but it does worsen ongoing autoimmune disease.
@result growth dynamics of white muscle fibres in relation to somatic growth of larvae of european sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax, l.) two genetically different populations of sea bass, dicentrarchus labrax l., atlantic (atl.) and mediterranean (med.), were subjected to the following incubation/cultivation temperatures (t): 15 °c/natural, 17 °c/natural, 15/19 °c, 17/19 °c (natural t averaging 15 °c and raising gradually). muscle cellularity was measured at different larval stages for each t regime. during the vitelline phase, muscle growth was mainly due to muscle fibre hypertrophy. in med. larvae, higher incubation t (17 °c) increased the area of white and red fibres at hatching, while in atl. larvae there was no significant t effect at this stage. at mouth opening, the area of white fibres increased at 19 °c in atl. larvae (p<0.05), but in med. larvae it was similar for all temperatures. following yolk-sac reabsorption, hypertrophy and hyperplasia increased in both populations. in these stages (20–55 days), both parameters were greater at 19 °c (p<0.05). metamorphosis finished earlier at 19 °c. at this stage, atl. larvae reared at 19 °c showed higher value of total myotomal area than at natural t, while in med. sea bass, larvae reared at 19 °c showed a lower size of the myotome than at 17 °c/natural. in larvae from both populations reared at natural t, incubating t had a positive effect at the end of metamorphosis, thus the total myotomal area were higher at 17 °c/natural than at 15 °c/natural. following metamorphosis, all groups showed a rapid growth, but higher at 19 °c (p<0.05). the results indicate that muscle cellularity was clearly influenced by t, and that both populations had different levels of response. these differences can be apparently associated with their respective genetic background.
@background a sodium channel gene scn9a polymorphism that increases nociceptor excitability inherited erythromelalgia/erythermalgia (iem) is a neuropathy characterized by pain and redness of the extremities that is triggered by warmth. iem has been associated with missense mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel nav1.7, which is preferentially expressed in most nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (drgs) and sympathetic ganglion neurons. several mutations occur in cytoplasmic linkers of nav1.7, with only two mutations in segment 4 (s4) and s6 of domain i. we report here a simplex case with an alanine 863 substitution by proline (a863p) in s5 of domain ii of nav1.7. the functional effect of a863p was investigated by voltage-clamp analysis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and by current-clamp analysis to determine the effects of a863p on firing properties of small drg neurons. activation of mutant channels was shifted by −8 mv, whereas steady-state fast inactivation was shifted by +10 mv, compared with wild-type (wt) channels. there was a marked decrease in the rate of deactivation of mutant channels, and currents elicited by slow ramp depolarizations were 12 times larger than for wt. these results suggested that a863p could render drg neurons hyperexcitable. we tested this hypothesis by studying properties of rat drg neurons transfected with either a863p or wt channels. a863p depolarized resting potential of drg neurons by +6 mv compared with wt channels, reduced the threshold for triggering single action potentials to 63% of that for wt channels, and increased firing frequency of neurons when stimulated with suprathreshold stimuli. thus, a863p mutant channels produce hyperexcitability in drg neurons, which contributes to the pathophysiology of iem.
@background the effect of non-enzymatic glycation of extracellular matrix proteins on axonal regeneration in vitro abstract the pattern of collagenisation in peripheral nerve in diabetic polyneuropathy was examined in nerve biopsy specimens from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy in comparison with organ donor control nerves and disease controls (other neuropathies). there was increased endoneurial collagenisation both in the diabetic polyneuropathy cases and the disease controls, this predominantly involving types i and iii. type ii collagen was not detected in organ donor control nerves or in the diabetic and the disease control nerves. there was a relative increase in type vi collagen in the endoneurium in the diabetic nerves immediately surrounding groups of schwann cells. this was not a feature in the other neuropathies. the quantity of types iv, v and vi collagen was increased around the endoneurial microvessels in the diabetic patients and, to a lesser extent, in those with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (hmsn). increased deposition of types iv and v collagen was observed in the perineurium in the diabetic nerves, the latter being most evident in the innermost lamellae where the amount of laminin was possibly also increased. the diameter of the general endoneurial collagen fibrils was greater in the diabetic nerves, although this was not more than in a disease control (hmsn). the collagen fibrils that were present within the basal laminal tubes that had surrounded degenerated myelinated fibres in the diabetic nerves, and those within the onion bulbs of the hmsn cases, were of the normal endoneurial calibre. the expression of laminin by büngner bands in diabetic neuropathy did not differ from that in disease control nerves, nor were any differences detected for fibronectin. whether the changes observed are important for the impaired regenerative capacity in diabetic neuropathy requires further investigation.
@background mammalian frataxin: an essential function for cellular viability through an interaction with a preformed iscu/nfs1/isd11 iron-sulfur assembly complex frataxin is an essential mitochondrial protein whose reduced expression causes friedreich's ataxia (frda), a lethal neurodegenerative disease. it is believed that frataxin is an iron chaperone that participates in iron metabolism. we have tested this hypothesis using the bacterial frataxin ortholog, cyay, and different biochemical and biophysical techniques. we observe that cyay participates in iron-sulfur (fe-s) cluster assembly as an iron-dependent inhibitor of cluster formation, through binding to the desulfurase iscs. the interaction with iscs involves the iron binding surface of cyay, which is conserved throughout the frataxin family. we propose that frataxins are iron sensors that act as regulators of fe-s cluster formation to fine-tune the quantity of fe-s cluster formed to the concentration of the available acceptors. our observations provide new perspectives for understanding frda and a mechanistic model that rationalizes the available knowledge on frataxin.
@method functional abnormalities of heparan sulfate in mucopolysaccharidosis-i are associated with defective biologic activity of fgf-2 on human multipotent progenitor cells. stem cell localization, conservation, and differentiation is believed to occur in niches in the marrow stromal microenvironment. our recent observation that long-term in vitro human hematopoiesis requires a stromal heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hspg) led us to hypothesize that such hspg may orchestrate the formation of the stem cell niche. we compared the structure and function of hs from m2-10b4, a hematopoiesis-supportive cell line, with hs from a nonsupportive cell line, fhs-173-we. long-term culture-initiating cell (ltc-ic) maintenance was enhanced by pg from supportive cells but not by pg from nonsupportive cells (p <.005). the supportive hs were significantly larger and more highly sulfated than the nonsupportive hs. specifically, supportive hs contained higher 6-o-sulfation on the glucosamine residues. in agreement with these observations, purified 6-o-sulfated heparin and highly 6-o-sulfated bovine kidney hs similarly maintained ltc-ic. in contrast, completely desulfated heparin, n-sulfated heparin, and unmodified heparin did not support ltc-ic maintenance. moreover, the supportive hs promoted ltc-ic maintenance but not differentiation of cd34(+)/hla-dr- cells into colony-forming cells (cfcs) and mature blood cells. the supportive hs but not the nonsupportive hs bound both cytokines and matrix components critical for hematopoiesis, including interleukin-3 (il-3), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (mip-1), and thrombospondin (tsp). significantly more cd34(+) cells adhered directly to immobilized o-sulfated heparin than to n-sulfated or desulfated heparin. thus, hematopoiesis-supportive stromal hspg possessing large, highly 6-o-sulfated hs mediate the juxtaposition of hematopoietic progenitors with stromal cells, specific growth-promoting (il-3) and growth-inhibitory (mip-1 and platelet factor 4 [pf4]) cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins such as tsp. we conclude that the structural specificity of stromal hspg that determines the selective colocalization of cytokines and ecm components leads to the formation of discrete niches, thereby orchestrating the controlled growth and differentiation of stem cells. these findings may have important implications for ex vivo expansion of and gene transfer into primitive hematopoietic progenitors.
@background visual approaches and photography for the study of immediate information space as an ethnographic research method, observation has a long history. the value of observation is that it permits researchers to study people in their native environment in order to understand "things" from their perspective. observation requires the researcher to spend considerable time in the field with the possibility of adopting various roles in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the people being studied. a variety of techniques are used to collect data. gaining access to the group and leaving the field are two important factors that need consideration. other areas of concern involve ethical problems, as well as validity and reliability issues. until recently, few library and information science (lis) studies have included this method; however, observation is gaining favor as lis researchers seek to understand better the role of information in people's everyday lives.
@background effect of probiotic feed additives on broiler chickens health and performance. 1. the effects of a mixture of 12 lactobacillus strains (lc) on the growth performance, abdominal fat deposition, serum lipids and weight of organs of broiler chickens were studied from 1 to 42 d of age. 2. one hundred and thirty-six 1-d-old male broiler chicks were assigned at random to two dietary treatments: a basal diet (control), and a basal diet with 0·1% lc. 3. the supplementation of lc in broiler diets improved the body weight gain and feed conversion rate from 1 to 42 d of age and was effective in reducing abdominal fat deposition but only after 28 d of age. 4. the lc diets reduced serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and triglycerides in broilers from 21 to 42 d of age. however, there was no significant difference in serum high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol between control and lc-fed broilers. there was also no significant difference in the weights of organs of control and lc-fed broilers. 5. the results indicated that the mixture of 12 lactobacillus strains have a hypolipidaemic effect on broilers.
@method optical characterization of two-layered turbid media for non-invasive, absolute oximetry in cerebral and extracerebral tissue we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
@background roles of the traf6 and pellino e3 ligases in myd88 and rankl signaling tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor–associated factor (traf)-6 mediates lys63-linked polyubiquitination for nf-κb activation via its n-terminal ring and zinc finger domains. here we report the crystal structures of traf6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) ubc13. the ring and zinc fingers of traf6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. interaction of traf6 with ubc13 involves direct contacts of the ring and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. unexpectedly, this region of traf6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric c-terminal traf domain. structure-based mutagenesis reveals that traf6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that traf6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length traf6. the mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.
@result human papillomavirus type 8 interferes with a novel c/ebpβ-mediated mechanism of keratinocyte ccl20 chemokine expression and langerhans cell migration most nuclear proteins reside on a specific chromatin site only for seconds or less. the hit-and-run model of transcriptional control maintains that transcription complexes are assembled in a stochastic fashion from freely diffusible proteins; this contrasts to models involving stepwise assembly of stable holo complexes. however, the chances of forming a productive complex improve if the binding of one factor promotes the binding of its interactors. we prove here that in living cells, the glucocorticoid receptor and hmgb1 interact only within chromatin and not in the nucleoplasm and decrease each other's mobility. thus, the formation of a gr-hmgb1-chromatin complex is more likely than one would expect from independent binding to chromatin of gr and hmgb1. remarkably, this complex is potentially stable, and its disassembly is effected by active, atp-consuming processes. we propose that kinetic cooperativity among transcription factors in chromatin binding may be a common feature in transcription and dna transactions.
@result sequential organ failure assessment score for evaluating organ failure and outcome of severe maternal morbidity in obstetric intensive care study objectives to determine the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) and organ failure and to describe the outcomes in critically ill obstetric patients who have been treated in medical icus.   design retrospective review.   setting a multidisciplinary icu at a tertiary-care institution.   methods we collected data on 74 obstetric patients who were admitted consecutively to the icu from january 1991 through december 1998. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii scores were calculated. a p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant.   measurements and results fifty-eight percent of patients were admitted to the icu postpartum. their mean (+/- sd) age was 25.9 +/- 7.0 years, and 64% were african american and 34% were white. fifty percent had preexisting medical conditions. their mean apache ii score was 14.0 +/- 5.9, and their predicted mortality rate was 17.6%. the most common reason for admission was respiratory insufficiency. preeclampsia was present in 38% of patients, and hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome were present in 7% of patients. sirs developed in 59% of patients. patients with sirs had longer icu stays (p = 0.0008). organ failure developed in 65% of patients, and ards developed in 15% of patients. invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 45% of patients, and pulmonary artery catheterization was required in 35% of patients. the in-hospital mortality rate was 2.7%. there were five spontaneous abortions and eight perinatal deaths.   conclusions the most common reason for admission to the icu of critically ill obstetric patients was respiratory failure. despite the severity of illness and the development of sirs and organ failure in most patients, the mortality rate was low.
@background identification of evolutionarily conserved, functional noncoding elements in the promoter region of the sodium channel gene scn8a to identify the transcriptional start sites of the neuronal channel scn8a, we carried out 5'-race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) with rna from human and mouse brain. we recovered four mutually exclusive 5'-untranslated exons (exon 1a to exon 1d) that map to a 1.8-kb region of genomic dna located approximately 70 kb upstream of the first coding exon. the same 5'-untranslated exons are expressed in central, peripheral and sympathetic nervous system and in embryonic and adult brain. a 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing these 5' exons demonstrated promoter activity in transfected mn-1 cells. in transgenic mice, transcription of the 4.8-kb promoter was restricted to brain and spinal cord. the 4.8-kb promoter contains eight consensus sp1-binding sites and two inr sites. a potential nrse/re-1 site is located nearby. two active polyadenylation sites identified by 3'-race are conserved in human, mouse, and chicken scn8a. sequence comparison of human and mouse scn8a identified 12 conserved noncoding elements whose effect on transcription was tested in transfected cells.
@method fate of the 63-kda periplasmic protein of the infectious form of the endonuclear symbiotic bacterium holospora obtusa during the infection process. the symbiotic bacterium holospora obtusa infects the macronucleus of the ciliate paramecium caudatum. after ingestion by its host, an infectious form of holospora with an electron-translucent tip passes through the host digestive vacuole and penetrates the macronuclear envelope with this tip. to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of this process, we raised a monoclonal antibody against the tip-specific 89-kda protein, sequenced this partially, and identified the corresponding complete gene. the deduced protein sequence carries two actin-binding motifs. indirect immunofluorescence microscopy shows that during escape from the host digestive vacuole, the 89-kda proteins translocates from the inside to the outside of the tip. when the bacterium invades the macronucleus, the 89-kda protein is left behind at the entry point of the nuclear envelope. transmission electron microscopy shows the formation of fine fibrous structures that co-localize with the antibody-labeled regions of the bacterium. our findings suggest that the 89-kda protein plays a role in holospora's escape from the host digestive vacuole, the migration through the host cytoplasm, and the invasion into the macronucleus.
@background effects of acute blood pressure elevation on biochemical-metabolic parameters in individuals with hypertensive crisis background the available studies have not fully analyzed the several factors involved in the genesis of hypertension (ht), especially the association among blood pressure, urinary sodium excretion and renal dysfunction.   objective to assess the ht prevalence and risk factors in different age groups in a representative sample of an urban brazilian population.   methods the studied population (1717 adult individuals) was evaluated by age groups: 18 to 39 years; 40 to 49; 50 to 59; 60 to 69 and > 70 years. quantitative variable means and categorical variables of the hypertensive and normotensive groups were compared.   results the adjusted overall prevalence of ht was 25.23%. the prevalence increased with age and was higher in individuals with low educational level. increased body mass index and abdominal waist were positively related to a higher prevalence of ht. there was a significant positive association between ht and urinary sodium excretion. hypertensive individuals presented higher frequency of renal dysfunction, defined as measured creatinine clearance <60 ml/min/m(2). the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 5.6% in the overall population and 14.5% in hypertensive individuals. hypertension was a known condition to 74.4% of the hypertensive individuals. among treated hypertensive individuals, 52.4% achieved controlled blood pressure and only 34.3% of the overall hypertensive patients (treated or not) had blood pressure controlled.   conclusion this population-based is unique by gathering different demographic, epidemiologic and risk factors involved in the genesis of hypertension in a single sample assessment with a population calculation, which might be extrapolated to other hypertensive populations.
@background a prospective, population-based study of androstenedione, estrogens, and prostatic cancer. plasma testosterone, androstenedione, oestradiol-17beta, follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) were not significantly different in patients with prostatic cancer, with benign prostatic hyperplasia or in patients without prostatic disease. plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly lower in the patients with benign disease than those with prostatic carcinoma. endocrine therapy in the form of stilboestrol administration significantly decreased plasma levels of testosterone, oestradiol-17beta, fsh and lh within 7 days of the treatment. after 7 days therapy prolactin levels increased significantly in all patients studied. changes in growth hormone concentrations were more varied in response to stilboestrol, being elevated in several patients and remaining unchanged in others. treatment of a few prostatic carcinoma patients who were receiving stilboestrol therapy with cb154, an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, brought an immediate decrease in prolactin levels which was was sustained. plasma testosterone, androstenedione and growth hormone were unchanged in these patients but a significant decrease in plasma oestradiol-17beta was noted in two patients during cb154 administration.
@background interaction between science and technology in the field of fuel cells based on patent paper analysis we examine the influence of faculty patenting activity on the rate, quality, and content of public research outputs in a panel dataset spanning the careers of 3,862 academic life scientists. using inverse probability of treatment weights (iptw) to account for the dynamics of self-selection into patenting, we find that patenting has a positive effect on the rate of publication of journal articles, but no effect on the quality of these publications. using several measures of the "patentability" of the content of research papers, we also find that patenters may be shifting their research focus to questions of commercial interest. we conclude that the often-voiced concern that patenting in academe has a nefarious effect on public research output is, at least in its simplest form, misplaced.
@method omnigraph: rich representation and graph kernel learning after presenting a novel o(n3) parsing algorithm for dependency grammar, we develop three contrasting ways to stochasticize it. we propose (a) a lexical affinity model where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words fluctuate randomly in their selectional preferences, and (c) a generative model where the speaker fleshes out each word's syntactic and conceptual structure without regard to the implications for the hearer. we also give preliminary empirical results from evaluating the three models' parsing performance on annotated wall street journal training text (derived from the penn treebank). in these results, the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equally well at assigning part-of-speech tags.
@method a de and pso based hybrid algorithm for dynamic optimization problems evolutionary algorithms (eas) are widely used to deal with optimization problems in dynamic environments (de) [3]. when using eas to solve de problems, we are usually interested in the algorithm's ability to adapt and recover from the changes. one of the main problems facing an evolutionary method when solving de problems is the loss of genetic diversity.in this paper, we investigate the use of evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods (emos) for single-objective de problems. for that purpose, we introduce an artificial second objective with the aim to maintain useful diversity in the population. six different artificial objectives are examined and compared.all the results will be compared against a traditional ga and the random immigrants algorithm[4]. nsga2 is employed as the evolutionary multi-objective technique.
@background control of prepotent responses by the superior medial frontal cortex intelligent behavior depends on the ability to suppress inappropriate actions and resolve interference between competing responses. recent clinical and neuroimaging evidence has demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal, parietal, and premotor areas during behaviors that emphasize conflict and inhibition. it remains unclear, however, whether discrete subregions within this network are crucial for overseeing more specific inhibitory demands. here we probed the functional specialization of human prefrontal cortex by combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) with integrated behavioral measures of response inhibition (stop-signal task) and response competition (flanker task). participants undertook a combined stop-signal/flanker task after rtms of the inferior frontal gyrus (ifg) or dorsal premotor cortex (dpm) in each hemisphere. stimulation of the right ifg impaired stop-signal inhibition under conditions of heightened response competition but did not influence the ability to suppress a competing response. in contrast, stimulation of the right dpm facilitated execution but had no effect on inhibition. neither of these results was observed during rtms of corresponding left-hemisphere regions. overall, our findings are consistent with existing evidence that the right ifg is crucial for inhibitory control. the observed double dissociation of neurodisruptive effects between the right ifg and right dpm further implies that response inhibition and execution rely on distinct neural processes despite activating a common cortical network.
@background mortality outcomes of low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer in urban china: a decision analysis and implications for practice background the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. the advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (ct) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose ct detects many tumors at early stages. the national lung screening trial (nlst) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose ct could reduce mortality from lung cancer.   methods from august 2002 through april 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 u.s. medical centers. participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose ct (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through december 31, 2009.   results the rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. the rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose ct and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. a total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose ct group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. the incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose ct group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.03 to 1.23). there were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose ct group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose ct screening of 20.0% (95% ci, 6.8 to 26.7; p=0.004). the rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose ct group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% ci, 1.2 to 13.6; p=0.02).   conclusions screening with the use of low-dose ct reduces mortality from lung cancer.

@result the right hemisphere of sleeping infant perceives sentential prosody we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to characterize cortical activation associated with sentence processing, thereby elucidating where in the brain auditory and visual inputs of words converge during sentence comprehension. within one scanning session, subjects performed three types of tasks with different linguistic components from perception to sentence comprehension: nonword (n(av); auditory and visual), phrase (p; either auditory or visual), and sentence (s; either auditory or visual) tasks. in a comparison of the p and n(av) tasks, the angular and supramarginal gyri showed bilateral activation, whereas the inferior and middle frontal gyri showed left-lateralized activation. a comparison of the s and p tasks, together with a conjunction analysis, revealed a ventral region of the left inferior frontal gyrus (f3t/f3o), which was sentence-processing selective and modality-independent. these results unequivocally demonstrated that the left f3t/f3o is involved in the selection and integration of semantic information that are separable from lexico-semantic processing.
@method standardization and km : evaluating knowledge quality if research is like a football game, then the first thing new players can expect to do is to learn some of the rules of the game and then to become skilled in playing the game according to these rules. a well-defined set of rules is a great advantage to novices and to seasoned players. in doing quantitative research, the rules are clear. to researchers trained in these methods, it may therefore come as a surprise to find that there exists a variation of the research game in which there are no fixed rules but only general principles. the position of the goal posts, for example, may be different for different games and may even be moved in the course of a game. some novices may see this as presenting the opportunity for a glorious free-for-all, releasing them from the constraints of the quantitative research game. in the midst of their new-found freedom, they may then find themselves accosted by experienced players who seem to have, after all, a definite set of rules. on being challenged, experienced players may then explain that, while there are only general principles, these are interpreted in a quite specific way depending on the particular context within which the game is being played. 'context' becomes the bugbear for the novice. the novice may even have to learn that, before booting the ball through the goal posts, the player has to take account of where the ball is coming from, where it wants to go and what meaning it, the ball, attaches to the experience of being kicked! freedom readily gives way to frustration and incomprehension. happily, there are some brave researchers who set about the task of making the rules of qualitative research explicit to novices and to experienced players. the three books reviewed here fall into that category. they all take on a different task. the collection of articles brought together in one edition by janice morse is not about the rules but about some exciting games that have been played. together the articles demonstrate not only the pleasures of the qualitative research game, but also its contribution to a fine, detailed understanding of important health prob-
@method genome-wide identification and characterization of a dehydrin gene family in poplar (populus trichocarpa) the algorithm described in this paper discovers one or more motifs in a collection of dna or protein sequences by using the technique of expectation maximization to fit a two-component finite mixture model to the set of sequences. multiple motifs are found by fitting a mixture model to the data, probabilistically erasing the occurrences of the motif thus found, and repeating the process to find successive motifs. the algorithm requires only a set of unaligned sequences and a number specifying the width of the motifs as input. it returns a model of each motif and a threshold which together can be used as a bayes-optimal classifier for searching for occurrences of the motif in other databases. the algorithm estimates how many times each motif occurs in each sequence in the dataset and outputs an alignment of the occurrences of the motif. the algorithm is capable of discovering several different motifs with differing numbers of occurrences in a single dataset.
@method a multi-kernel framework for inductive semi-supervised learning multiple kernel learning aims at simultaneously learning a kernel and the associated predictor in supervised learning settings. for the support vector machine, an efficient and general multiple kernel learning (mkl) algorithm, based on semi-infinite linear progamming, has been recently proposed. this approach has opened new perspectives since it makes the mkl approach tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. however, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. in this paper, we address the mkl problem through an adaptive 2-norm regularization formulation that encourages sparse kernel combinations. apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard svm optimization problem, where the kernel is defined as a linear combination of multiple kernels. we propose an algorithm, named simplemkl, for solving this mkl problem and provide a new insight on mkl algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. furthermore, we show how simplemkl can be applied beyond binary classification, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classification) or multiclass classification. experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and that its efficiency compares favorably to other mkl algorithms. finally, we illustrate the usefulness of mkl for some regressors based on wavelet kernels and on some model selection problems related to multiclass classification problems. a simplemkl toolbox is available at http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakotom/code/mklindex.html 1 ha l-0 02 18 33 8, v er si on 1 26 j an 2 00 8
@method evaluating molecular mechanical potentials for helical peptides and proteins we study atomic models of the thermodynamics of the structural transition of peptides that form α-helices. the effect of sequence variation on α-helix formation for alanine-rich peptides, ac-ala21- methyl amide (a21) and ac-a5 (aaara)3a-methyl amide (fs peptide), is investigated by atomic simulation studies of the thermodynamics of the helix-coil transition in explicit water. the simulations show that the guanidinium group in the arg side chains in the fs peptide interacts with the carbonyl group four amino acids upstream in the chain and desolvates backbone hydrogen bonds. this desolvation can be directly correlated with a higher probability of hydrogen bond formation. we find that fs has higher helical content than a21 at all temperatures. a small modification in the amber force field reproduces the experimental helical content and helix-coil transition temperatures for the fs peptide.

@method a coupled deformable model for tracking myocardial borders from real-time echocardiography using an incompressibility constraint this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
@background exploratory survey of patients’ needs and perceptions of psychosocial oncology today only half of those diagnosed with cancer will die of the disease, leaving enormous room for psychosocial interventions to improve the psychological or functional status of those coping with the disease. therefore, social workers in oncology must be current with empirical research. in an effort to integrate current research into social work practice, we reviewed empirical studies with sound research designs to answer the following questions: (1) what portion of cancer patients are likely to need social work services? (2) what types of services do social workers provide to meet these needs? and (3) who is likely to be (or not to be) the recipient of these services. does intervention research include diverse (non-traditional, non-white and non-middle class) clients? the results show about one third of patients will be judged at high-risk for psychosocial problems but that only 15-25% of those who are diagnosed with cancer will eventually use psychosocial oncology services. some have mainly instrumental, concrete needs, and others will use psychosocial counseling. a review of the inclusion of minorities and non-traditional, non-middle-class groups, shows that they are not adequately represented in current intervention research in psychosocial oncology. methods for enlarging their access and participation are suggested.
@result identification and prediction of distress trajectories in the first year after a breast cancer diagnosis. depression is a significant problem for some breast cancer survivors after the end of treatment. this study assessed depression using the ces‐d for 84 breast cancer patients at the conclusion of radiation treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post‐treatment. based on the pattern of ces‐d scores, patients were divided into five groups: (1) stay depressed (scores above clinical cutoff for depression at all timepoints); (2) recover (above threshold at baseline, but below at follow‐up); (3) become depressed (below threshold at baseline, but above at follow‐up); (4) never depressed (below threshold at all times); and (5) vacillate (none of the above patterns). this study examined the relationships between depression groups and a variety of medical, demographic, and psychological measures, including anxiety and quality of life (qol). number of children at home significantly distinguished the groups, with the become depressed group having more children and the vacillate group having fewer children. anxiety levels were different among the groups, with recover and never depressed groups having consistently lower anxiety scores. qol scores also distinguished the groups in that never depressed patients demonstrated better qol than all other groups. the findings have implications for understanding resilience in cancer patients. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
@background phylogenetic and syntenic data support a single horizontal transference to a trypanosoma ancestor of a prokaryotic proline racemase implicated in parasite evasion from host defences lymphocyte polyclonal activation is a generalized mechanism of immune evasion among pathogens. in a mouse model of trypanosoma cruzi infection (american trypanosomiasis), reduced levels of polyclonal lymphocyte responses correlate with resistance to infection and cardiopathy. we report here the characterization of a parasite protein with b-cell mitogenic properties in culture supernatants of infective forms, the cloning of the corresponding gene and the analysis of the biological properties of its product. we characterized the protein as a co-factor-independent proline racemase, and show that its expression as a cytoplasmic and/or membrane-associated protein is life-stage specific. inhibition studies indicate that availability of the racemase active site is necessary for mitogenic activity. this is the first report to our knowledge of a eukaryotic amino acid racemase gene. our findings have potential consequences for the development of new immune therapies and drug design against pathogens.
@background adaptive clustering for coreference resolution with deterministic rules and web-based language models most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
@background investigation of metabolites accumulation in medical plant gentiana rigescens during different growing stage using lc-ms/ms and ft-ir a method based on hplc with diode array detector (dad) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (esi-ms) was established for the simultaneous determination of 5-hmf and its derivatives, including a new 5-hmf derivative, in rehmanniae radix preparata. validation parameters, such as linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, recovery, accuracy, and precision, were successfully obtained. in addition, the efficiencies of diverse extraction methods were compared for the development of a standard analytical method. the verified method was successfully applied to the quantitative determination of four representative metabolites in eighteen r. radix preparata samples from korea and china. additionally, the increase in the amount of 5-hmf derivatives was monitored during the processing of three dried r. radix samples. the results showed that a newly isolated diglycosylated 5-hmf derivative, 5-(α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-galactopyranosyloxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde, appeared in concentrations comparable to that of 5-hmf, suggesting its potential to serve as a marker compound in r. radix preparata.
@result green liquor dregs effect on kraft mill secondary sludge composting. two-phase olive mill waste (tpomw) is a semisolid sludge generated during the extraction of olive oil by the two-phase centrifugation system. among all the available disposal options, composting is gaining interest as a sustainable strategy to recycle tpomw for agricultural purposes. the quality of compost for agronomical use depends on the degree of organic matter stabilization, but despite several studies on the topic, there is not a single method available which alone can give a certain indication of compost stability. in addition, information on the biological and biochemical properties, including the enzymatic activity (ea) of compost, is rare. the aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of some enzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid-phosphatase, alkaline-phosphatase, urease and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (fda)) as parameters to evaluate organic matter stability during the composting of tpomw. these enzymatic indices were also compared to conventional stability indices. for this purpose two composting piles were prepared by mixing tpomw with sheep manure and grape stalks in different proportions, with forced aeration and occasional turnings. the composting of tpomw followed the common pattern reported previously for this kind of material with a reduction of 40-50% of organic matter, a gradual increase in ph, disappearance of phytotoxicity and formation of humic-like c. all ea increased during composting except acid-phosphatase. significant correlations were found between ea and some important conventional stability indices indicating that ea can be a simple and reliable tool to determine the degree of stability of tpomw composts.
@background late neoproterozoic dokhan volcanics, north eastern desert, egypt: geochemistry and petrogenesis willis, k.m., stern, r.j. and clauer, n., 1988. age and geochemistry of late precambrian sediments of the hammamat series from the northeastern desert of egypt. precambrian res., 42: 173-187. late precambrian crustal evolution in the northeastern desert of egypt culminated in a major episode of strong extension, accompanied by bimodal igneous activity and deposition of clastic sediments in restricted terrigenous basins. these sediments, known as the hammamat series, record the uncovering of the evolving crust of the region. we have undertaken petrographic, geochemical, and rb-sr and k-ar geochronologic studies of hammamat samples collected along a single traverse. the lower half of a 400 m thick section consists of coarse detritus shed from nearby ensimatic terranes, while the upper half was derived from rapid reworking of bimodal igneous rocks similar to those of the dokhan volcanics and pink granites, units that are preserved within the region. rb-sr whole-rock analyses give an 8-point isochron age of 585 +_ 15 ma with an initial stsr/~sr of 0.70323 ± 0.00013, interpreted to approximate closely the time of sedimentation. this is very similar to the k-ar ages of the coarser clay fractions (2-0.5 #m) (588-567 ma). this result is consistent with stratigraphic considerations and other geochronological studies indicating that hammamat deposition occurred at ~ 590 ma. rb-sr analyses of leached and unleached size fractions indicate thermal resetting at 524 +_ 17 ma accompanied or followed by fluxing of a radiogenic sr-rich pore fluid (stsr/s~sr =0.7124). this is further indicated by k-ar ages of the 0.2-0.5 ttm size fraction of 542-532 ma.
@background imaging modalities in the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy. abstract objective. to evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ceus) and compare it to ultrasound (us) and 64-slice-ct (64-ct) for diagnosing, staging and evaluation of resectability of pancreatic cancer. material and methods. us, ceus and 64-ct were performed in 49 consecutive patients with pancreatic head tumors and with suspected cancer. after evaluation 44 patients had pancreatic head adenocarcinoma and 5 had chronic pancreatitis, all confirmed by histology. results. the sensitivity of us, ceus and 64-ct for diagnosing malignant pancreatic head tumors was 89%, 86% and 93%, respectively, and the overall accuracy was 82%, 86% and 88% respectively. there was no significant difference in the malignant tumor size measurement between us and ceus (p = 0.3619) or between us and 64-ct (p = 0.2129), but a significant difference was seen in the size measured by ceus and 64-ct (p = 0.0197). the ceus measurements on the tumor size were smaller. the overall accuracy for m staging of the patients who had surgery for adenocarcinoma was 86% and 90% for us + ceus and 64-ct, respectively. by performing the ceus and 64-ct we additionally found, respectively, 35% and 45% non-resectable patients of a group of patients, who were considered resectable on the primary radiological image material. conclusions. ceus may be a useful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic head tumors. for the assessment of resectability ceus did not prove useful. however, ceus seemed very useful as an additional instrument in the detection of non-resectable patients already considered resectable on primary radiological image material.
@method online convolutional sparse coding with sample-dependent dictionary in recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. recent activity in this field concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a pre-specified set of linear transforms, or by adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. both these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. in this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. we present a new method – the k-svd algorithm – generalizing the k-means clustering process. k-svd is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary, and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. the update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. the k-svd algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, focuss, or matching pursuit). we analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results on both synthetic tests and in applications on real image data.
@background interferons accelerate decay of replication-competent nucleocapsids of hepatitis b virus hepatocytes are extensively used in studies of gene regulation but cannot be maintained in long-term culture as replicating, differentiated cells while remaining nontumorigenic. we have derived two hepatocyte lines from livers of transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor alpha, a potent hepatocyte mitogen, which overcome these limitations. the transgenic hepatocytes were maintained for > or = 2 months in serum-supplemented primary culture and gave rise to cell lines, of which two (aml12 and aml14) have been cultured for > 1.5 years (> 80 passages). both lines have typical hepatocyte features such as peroxisomes and bile canalicular-like structures, do not grow in soft agar, and are nontumorigenic in nude mice. like normal hepatocytes, aml cells express high levels of mrna for serum (albumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin) and gap junction (connexins 26 and 32) proteins, secrete albumin, and contain solely isozyme 5 of lactate dehydrogenase. after extensive passaging, aml12 cells continue to strongly coexpress hepatocyte connexin mrnas but do not display nonparenchymal cell markers. although mrna levels for some serum proteins progressively fall, high expression in late aml12 cultures may be regained by passage in serum-free medium. the aml14 line loses expression of both differentiated markers and transgene mrna with extended passaging, and hepatocytic traits are only partially restored by passage in serum-free medium. these differentiated, nontumorigenic cell lines should serve as models in which to study hepatocyte growth and differentiation.
@result combination therapy with sulfasalazine and valproic acid promotes human glioblastoma cell death through imbalance of the intracellular oxidative response temozolomide (tmz) is an oral alkylating agent that has been widely used in the treatment of refractory glioma, although inherent and acquired resistance to this drug is common. the clinical use of valproic acid (vpa) as an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug has been reported primarily for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder and less commonly for major depression. vpa is also used in the treatment of glioma-associated seizures with or without intracranial operation. in this study, we evaluated the potential synergistic effect of tmz and vpa in human glioma cell lines. compared with the use of tmz or vpa alone, concurrent treatment with both drugs synergistically induced apoptosis in u87mg cells as evidenced by p53 and bax expression, mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, reactive oxygen species production, and glutathione depletion. this synergistic effect correlated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor and corresponded with reduced heme oxygenase-1 and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression. pretreatment with n-acetylcysteine partially recovered the apoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination treatment. the same degree of synergism is also seen in p53-mutant hs683 cells, which indicates that p53 may not play a major role in the increased proapoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination. in conclusion, vpa enhanced the apoptotic effect of tmz, possibly through a redox regulation mechanism. the tmz/vpa combination may be effective for treating glioma cancer and may be a powerful agent against malignant glioma. this drug combination should be further explored in the clinical setting.
@background socs36e limits stat signaling via cullin2 and a socs-box independent mechanism in the drosophila egg chamber patterns of cell fates generated by morphogens are critically important for normal development; however, the mechanisms by which graded morphogen signals are converted into all-or-none cell fate responses are incompletely understood. in the drosophila ovary, high and sustained levels of the secreted morphogen unpaired (upd) specify the migratory border-cell population by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat). a lower or transient level of stat activity specifies a non-migratory population of follicle cells. here we identify mir-279 as a component of a feedback pathway that further dampens the response in cells with low levels of jak/stat activity. mir-279 directly repressed stat, and loss of mir-279 mimicked stat gain-of-function or loss of apontic (apt), a known feedback inhibitor of stat. apt was essential for mir-279 expression in non-migratory follicle cells, whereas another stat target, ken and barbie (ken), downregulated mir-279 in border cells. mathematical modelling and simulations of this regulatory circuit including mir-279, apt and ken supported key roles for mir-279 and apt in generating threshold responses to the upd gradient.
@method real life experience with alemtuzumab treatment of patients with lower-risk mds and a hypocellular bone marrow immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to induce sustained hematological responses in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (mds). in particular, antithymocyte globulin (atg), a polyclonal immunoglobulin induces hematological responses in up to 60% of mds patients. we report herein on the results of a retrospective multicenter study on the use of atg in the treatment of 96 patients with mds. patients were evaluated for duration of response to atg, as well as survival after administration of atg. the median age of the cohort was 54.7 years (range: 19–75 years), with a median follow-up of 33.8 months (range: 0.8–133 months). a total of 40 patients (42%) achieved a hematological response, of which 30 patients (75%) had a durable hematological response lasting a median duration of 31.5 months (range: 6–92 months). on multivariate analysis, both low international prognostic scoring system (ipss) and bone marrow (bm) hypocellularity were independent predictive factors for improved response to atg (ipss int-2/high: odds ratio (or) 0.08, p=0.018 and bm normo/hypercellularity: or 0.49, p=0.012). in addition, ipss was the sole predictor of overall survival, with int-2/high risk patients having a significantly poorer survival outcome (or 0.08, p<0.01). in conclusion, this study identifies bm hypocellularity and a low ipss as important factors predicting response to atg.
@background perioperative complications after surgical treatment in degenerative adult de novo scoliosis the purpose of this study was to document the diagnostic findings in a group of adult patients presenting with both scoliosis and pain. fifty-five adults were evaluated by medical history, physical examination, radiography, myelography followed by computed tomography, discography followed by computed tomography, and single- and dual-photon densitometry. curves were 49% adult degenerative onset, 44% idiopathic. the older degenerative patients had myelographic defects most commonly within the primary curve and multiple abnormal, not necessarily painful, discs throughout the lumbar spine on discography. the idiopathic group had myelographic defects most commonly in a compensatory lumbar or lumbosacral curve. on discography, all idiopathic patients had at least one abnormal, painful disc, and 88% had their pain reproduced. pain-producing pathology was frequently identified in areas that would not have been included in the fusion area according to accepted rules for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
@background adolescents, adults and rewards: comparing motivational neurocircuitry recruitment using fmri adolescence is a developmental period that entails substantial changes in affective and incentive-seeking behavior relative to both childhood and adulthood, including a heightened propensity to engage in risky behaviors and experience persistent negative and labile mood states. this review discusses the emotional and incentive-driven behavioral changes in adolescents and their associated neural mechanisms, focusing on the dynamic interactions between the amygdala, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex. common behavioral changes during adolescence may be associated with a heightened responsiveness to incentives and emotional cues while the capacity to effectively engage in cognitive and emotion regulation is still relatively immature. we highlight empirical work in humans and animals that addresses the interactions between these neural systems in adolescents relative to children and adults, and propose a neurobiological model that may account for the nonlinear changes in adolescent behavior. finally, we discuss other influences that may contribute to exaggerated reward and emotion processing associated with adolescence, including hormonal fluctuations and the role of the social environment.
@method multiple rrna operons are essential for efficient cell growth and sporulation as well as outgrowth in bacillus subtilis. rna was extracted from dormant and germinating bacillus subtilis 168 spores (intact spores and chemically decoated spores) by using rapid rupture followed by acid–phenol extraction. spore germination progress was monitored by assaying colony forming ability before and after heat shock and by reading the optical density at 600 nm. the purity, yield, and composition of the extracted rna were determined spectrophotometrically from the ratio of absorption at 260 nm to that at 280 nm; in a 2100 bioanalyzer, giving the rna yield/108 spores or cells and the distribution pattern of rrna components. the method reported here for the extraction of rna from dormant spores, as well as during different phases of germination and outgrowth, has proven to be fast, efficient and simple to handle. rna of a high purity was obtained from dormant spores and during all phases of germination and growth. there was a significant increase in rna yield during the transition from dormant spores to germination and subsequent outgrowth. chemically decoated spores were retarded in germination and outgrowth compared with intact spores, and less rna was extracted; however, the differences were not significant. this method for rna isolation of dormant, germinating, and outgrowing bacterial endospores is a valuable prerequisite for gene expression studies, especially in studies on the responses of spores to hostile environmental conditions.

@method compression of deep neural networks for image instance retrieval evidence is mounting that convnets are the best representation learning method for recognition. in the common scenario, a convnet is trained on a large labeled dataset and the feed-forward units activation, at a certain layer of the network, is used as a generic representation of an input image. recent studies have shown this form of representation to be astoundingly effective for a wide range of recognition tasks. this paper thoroughly investigates the transferability of such representations w.r.t. several factors. it includes parameters for training the network such as its architecture and parameters of feature extraction. we further show that different visual recognition tasks can be categorically ordered based on their distance from the source task. we then show interesting results indicating a clear correlation between the performance of tasks and their distance from the source task conditioned on proposed factors. furthermore, by optimizing these factors, we achieve state-of-the-art performances on 16 visual recognition tasks.
@background straight sinus thrombosis during neurosurgical operation the basal ganglia and thalamus are paired deep gray matter structures that may be involved by a wide variety of disease entities. the basal ganglia are highly metabolically active and are symmetrically affected in toxic poisoning, metabolic abnormalities, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. both the basal ganglia and thalamus may be affected by other systemic or metabolic disease, degenerative disease, and vascular conditions. focal flavivirus infections, toxoplasmosis, and primary central nervous system lymphoma may also involve both deep gray matter structures. the thalamus is more typically affected alone by focal conditions than by systemic disease. radiologists may detect bilateral abnormalities of the basal ganglia and thalamus in different acute and chronic clinical situations, and although magnetic resonance (mr) imaging is the modality of choice for evaluation, the correct diagnosis can be made only by taking all relevant clinical and laboratory information into account. the neuroimaging diagnosis is influenced not only by detection of specific mr imaging features such as restricted diffusion and the presence of hemorrhage, but also by detection of abnormalities involving other parts of the brain, especially the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and white matter. judicious use of confirmatory neuroimaging investigations, especially diffusion-weighted imaging, mr angiography, mr venography, and mr spectroscopy during the same examination, may help improve characterization of these abnormalities and help narrow the differential diagnosis.
@method a simple hierarchical pooling data structure for loop closure this paper presents a mathematical definition of the "probability-weighted amount of information" (pwi), a measure of specificity of terms in documents that is based on an information-theoretic view of retrieval events. the proposed pwi is expressed as a product of the occurrence probabilities of terms and their amounts of information, and corresponds well with the conventional term frequency-inverse document frequency measures that are commonly used in today's information retrieval systems. the mathematical definition of the pwi is shown, together with some illustrative examples of the calculation.
@method mining bucket order-preserving submatrices in gene expression data subspace clustering has attracted great attention due to its capability of finding salient patterns in high dimensional data. order preserving subspace clusters have been proven to be important in high throughput gene expression analysis, since functionally related genes are often co-expressed under a set of experimental conditions. such co-expression patterns can be represented by consistent orderings of attributes. existing order preserving cluster models require all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order without deviation. however, real data are noisy due to measurement technology limitation and experimental variability which prohibits these strict models from revealing true clusters corrupted by noise. in this paper, we study the problem of revealing the order preserving clusters in the presence of noise. we propose a noise-tolerant model called approximate order preserving cluster (aopc). instead of requiring all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order, we require that (1) at least a certain fraction of the objects have identical attribute order; (2) other objects in the cluster may deviate from the consensus order by up to a certain fraction of attributes. we also propose an algorithm to mine aopc. experiments on gene expression data demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm.
@background rate of thyroglossal duct remnant visualization after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and its impact on clinical outcome of radioactive iodine (i-131) ablation objective the purpose of this study was to determine the incremental value of (131)i spect/ct over traditional planar imaging of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.   materials and methods fifty-six planar and spect/ct scans were obtained for 53 patients. forty-eight scans were diagnostic (131)i studies before first radioiodine therapy, four were diagnostic (131)i studies with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation, and four scans were posttherapy (131)i studies. two nuclear physicians interpreted central neck and distant activity on planar scans and reviewed spect/ct images to assess the incremental diagnostic value with respect to localization and characterization of focal activity and to evaluate reader confidence. one of the readers was unblinded and had access to clinical, imaging, histologic, and biochemical information.   results planar scans depicted 130 neck foci and 17 distant foci. at spect/ct these foci were further characterized as thyroglossal duct and thyroid bed remnant (n = 98), cervical nodal metastasis or local residual disease (n = 26), physiologic activity (n = 11), and distant metastasis (n = 12). interobserver disagreement occurred on eight of 147 foci (5%). because of superior lesion localization and additional anatomic information derived from the low-dose ct component, incremental diagnostic value with spect/ct over planar imaging was found for 70 of 147 foci (47.6%), including 53 of 130 neck foci (40.8%) and all 17 (100%) distant foci. reader confidence increased regarding 104 of 147 foci (70.7%).   conclusion iodine-131 spect/ct is useful for accurate evaluation of regional and distant activity in characterization of foci as residual thyroid tissue or nodal, pulmonary, or osseous metastasis. suspected physiologic mimics of disease can be confirmed with increased reader confidence.
@background physical exposure of sign language interpreters: baseline measures and reliability analysis the objectives of this study were (a) to determine errors in wrist angle measurements from a commercially available biaxial electrogoniometer and (b) to develop a calibration routine in order to correct for these errors. goniometric measurements were collected simultaneously with true angular data using a fixture that allowed wrist movement in one plane while restricting motion in the orthogonal plane. these data were collected in two sets of trials: flexion/extension with radial/ulnar deviation restricted, and radial/ulnar deviation with flexion/extension restricted. during these trials, we studied discrete 30° increments of forearm rotation. the results showed the expected cross talk and zero drift errors during forearm rotation. the application of mathematical equations that describe the effect of goniometer twist resulted in significant error reduction for most forearm rotations. the calibration technique employs both a slope and a displacement transformation to improve the accuracy of angular data. the calibration technique may be used on data collected in the field if forearm rotation is measured simultaneously with the goniometer data.
@method arachidonic acid-induced apoptosis in rat hepatoma as-30d cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species. arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
@background improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
@method intestinal stem cells in gi physiology and disease comparison of effects of a selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor versus a 5-ht 4 receptor agonist on in vivo neurogenesis at the rectal anastomosis in rats moderate rectal distension elicits recto-rectal reflex contractions and simultaneous recto-internal anal sphincter reflex relaxations that together comprise the defecation reflex. both reflexes are controlled by 1) pelvic nerves, 2) lumbar colonic nerves, and 3) enteric nervous system. the aim of the present study was to explore a novel approach to repairing the defecation reflex dysfunction by using the plasticity of enteric nervous pathways. experiments were performed in anesthetized guinea pigs with ethyl carbamate. the rectum 30 mm oral from the anal verge was transected without damage to extrinsic nerves, and subsequent end-to-end one-layer anastomosis was performed. recovery of the defecation reflex and associated reflex pathways were evaluated. eight weeks after sectioning of intrinsic reflex nerve pathways in the rectum, the defecation reflex recovered to the control level, accompanied with regeneration of reflex pathways. the 5-ht(4)-receptor agonist mosapride (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the recovered defecation reflex 8 wk after surgery. two weeks after local treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf: 10(-6) g/ml) at the rectal anastomotic site, the recto-internal anal sphincter reflex relaxations recovered and some bundles of fine nerve fibers were shown to interconnect the oral and anal ends of the myenteric plexus. these results suggested a possibility for repairing the anal dysfunction by promoting regeneration of the reflex pathways in the enteric nervous system with local application of bdnf.
@background extrapair paternity rates vary with latitude and elevation in emberizid sparrows comprehensive, accurate paternity assignment is critical to answering numerous questions in evolutionary ecology. yet, most studies of species with extra‐pair paternity (epp) fail to assign sires to all offspring. common limitations include incomplete and biased sampling of offspring and males, particularly with respect to male location and social status, potentially biasing estimated patterns of paternity. studies that achieve comprehensive sampling and paternity assignment are therefore required. accordingly, we genotyped virtually all males and >99% of 6‐day‐old offspring over 16 years in a song sparrow (melospiza melodia) population and used three complementary statistical methodologies to attempt complete paternity assignment for all 2207 offspring. assignments were highly consistent across maximum likelihood methods that used solely genotype data, and heuristic and integrated bayesian analyses that included data describing individual locations. sires were assigned to >99% of all genotyped offspring with ≥95% confidence, revealing an epp rate of c. 28%. extra‐pair sires primarily occupied territories neighbouring their extra‐pair offspring; spatial location was therefore highly informative for paternity assignment. epp was biased towards paired territorial males, although unpaired territorial and floater males sired c. 13% of extra‐pair offspring. failing to sample and include unpaired males as candidate sires would therefore substantially reduce assignment rates. these analyses demonstrate the integration of genetic and ecological information to achieve comprehensive paternity assignment and direct biological insight, illustrate the potential biases that common forms of incomplete sampling could have on estimated patterns of epp, and provide an essential basis for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of epp.
@background expression and function of s100a8/a9 (calprotectin) in human typhoid fever and the murine salmonella model the discovery of toll-like receptors (tlrs) as components that recognize conserved structures in pathogens has greatly advanced understanding of how the body senses pathogen invasion, triggers innate immune responses and primes antigen-specific adaptive immunity. although tlrs are critical for host defense, it has become apparent that loss of negative regulation of tlr signaling, as well as recognition of self molecules by tlrs, are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. furthermore, it is now clear that the interaction between tlrs and recently identified cytosolic innate immune sensors is crucial for mounting effective immune responses. here we describe the recent advances that have been made by research into the role of tlr biology in host defense and disease.
@background cytoplasmic translocation, aggregation, and cleavage of tdp-43 by enteroviral proteases modulate viral pathogenesis ubiquitin-positive, tau- and α-synuclein–negative inclusions are hallmarks of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. although the identity of the ubiquitinated protein specific to either disorder was unknown, we showed that tdp-43 is the major disease protein in both disorders. pathologic tdp-43 was hyper-phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved to generate c-terminal fragments and was recovered only from affected central nervous system regions, including hippocampus, neocortex, and spinal cord. tdp-43 represents the common pathologic substrate linking these neurodegenerative disorders.
@result fibronectin stimulates human sperm capacitation through the cyclic amp/protein kinase a pathway. signal transduction pathways regulate various aspects of mammalian sperm function. when human sperm were incubated in a medium supporting capacitation, proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. this phosphorylation was inhibited by genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. phosphorylation was also reduced when sperm were incubated either in the presence of increasing concentrations of extracellular ca2+ or in a medium containing the ca2+ ionophore a23187. this ca2+-induced dephosphorylation was calmodulin-dependent, suggesting that calcineurin was involved. in this regard, the calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin inhibited the ca2+ ionophore-induced dephosphorylation. a limited number of mr 80,000-105,000 polypeptides were the most prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins present in human sperm. unlike mouse sperm, which contains a tyrosine-phosphorylated isoform of hexokinase, a phosphotyrosine-containing hexokinase in human sperm was not detected. most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were triton x-100-insoluble and were localized to the principal piece of the flagellum, the region where the cytoskeletal fibrous sheath is found. prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of mr 82,000 and 97,000 were identified as the human homologues of mouse sperm akap82, the major fibrous sheath protein, and pro-akap82, its precursor polypeptide, respectively. these proteins are a kinase anchor proteins, polypeptides that sequester protein kinase a to subcellular locations. taken together, these results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation may be part of a signal transduction cascade(s) regulating events pertaining to capacitation and/or motility in mammalian sperm and that an interrelationship between tyrosine kinase and camp signaling pathways exists in these cells.
@background molecular regulation of alternative polyadenylation (apa) within the drosophila nervous system cleavage factor i(m) (cfi(m)) is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic mrna 3' processing machinery that functions in sequence-specific poly(a) site recognition through the collaboration of a 25 kda subunit containing a nudix domain and a larger subunit of 59, 68, or 72 kda containing an rna recognition motif (rrm). our previous work demonstrated that cfi(m)25 is both necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific binding of the poly(a) site upstream element ugua. here, we report the crystal structure of cfi(m)25 complexed with the rrm domain of cfi(m)68 and rna. the cfi(m)25 dimer is clasped on opposite sides by two cfi(m)68 rrm domains. each cfi(m)25 subunit binds one ugua element specifically. biochemical analysis indicates that the cfi(m)68 rrms serve to enhance rna binding and facilitate rna looping. the intrinsic ability of cfi(m) to direct rna looping may provide a mechanism for its function in the regulation of alternative poly(a) site selection.
@background evidence for source–sink dynamics in a regional population of arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii plesius) nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
@background up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase stimulates human glioma xenograft growth and angiogenesis. angiogenesis is the process in which new vessels emerge from existing endothelial lined vessels. this is distinct from the process of vasculogenesis in that the endothelial cells arise by proliferation from existing vessels rather than differentiating from stem cells. angiogenesis is an invasive process that requires proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, as well as synthesis of new matrix components. during embryonic development, both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis contribute to formation of the circulatory system. in the adult, with the single exception of the reproductive cycle in women, angiogenesis is initiated only in response to a pathologic condition, such as inflammation or hypoxia. the angiogenic response is critical for progression of wound healing and rheumatoid arthritis. angiogenesis is also a prerequisite for tumor growth and metastasis formation. therefore, understanding the cellular events involved in angiogenesis and the molecular regulation of these events has enormous clinical implications. this understanding is providing novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer.
@background heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in paediatrics: clinical characteristics, therapy and outcomes we report on four children with heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia type ii. in three patients, therapy with unfractionated heparin was associated with development of cardiac thrombi or with thrombosis progression up to the inferior vena cava or with aggravation of peripheral arterial occlusion. in the fourth child, the disease was recognized early on, and no complication occurred. heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia type ii was confirmed by heparin‐induced platelet activation assay and/or heparin/platelet factor 4‐elisa. concomitant elevated antiphospholipid antibodies were seen in all patients. danaparoid sodium applied at a dosage of between 1.2 and 7.1 u/kg/h stopped the disease progression in each patient. three children had a clinical recovery with partial recanalization, but for the child with peripheral arterial occlusion disease, amputation of some of the toes became necessary.
@background health effects on children’s willingness to compete this paper introduces a three-item "cognitive reflection test" (crt) as a simple measure of one type of cognitive ability—the ability or disposition to reflect on a question and resist reporting the first response that comes to mind. the author will show that crt scores are predictive of the types of choices that feature prominently in tests of decision-making theories, like expected utility theory and prospect theory. indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability—an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. the author examines the relation between crt scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. the crt scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive "style." the crt scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences. the final section addresses the interpretation of correlations between cognitive abilities and decision-making characteristics.
@method weakly supervised 3d reconstruction with adversarial constraint inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve robust 3d reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture that we call the 3d recurrent reconstruction neural network (3d-r2n2). the network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3d shapes from a large collection of synthetic data [13]. our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3d occupancy grid. unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and (ii) enables the 3d reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional sfm/slam methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).
@result local and global contributions to hemodynamic activity in mouse cortex potential contributions of concurrently acquired pupil dilation data to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) experiments were examined. sixteen healthy participants completed a working memory task (digit sorting) during measurement of pupil dilation outside the fmri environment and during concurrent 3t fmri assessment. pupil dilation increased parametrically with task difficulty inside and outside the scanner, on a similar time course, suggesting that task demand was similar in both environments. the time course of pupil dilation during digit sorting was similar to the time course of the fmri signal in the middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that middle-frontal gyrus activity indexed the engagement working memory processes. incorporating individual differences in pupil dilation improved the sensitivity and specificity of general linear modeling analyses of activity in the middle frontal gyrus, above and beyond standard analytic techniques. results suggest concurrent pupil dilation during fmri assessment can help to (1) specify whether task demand is the same inside and outside the fmri environment, (2) resolve the extent to which fmri signals reflect different aspects of event-related designs, and (3) explain variation in fmri data due to individual differences in information processing.
@background new causally ordered delivery protocol using information of immediate predecessor messages between brokers and subscribers with the sharp increase in heterogeneity and distribution of elements in wide-area networks, more flexible, efficient and autonomous approaches for management and information distribution are needed. this paper proposes a novel approach, based on gossip protocols and firefly synchronisation theory, for the management policy distribution and synchronisation over a number of nodes in an application level active network (alan). the work is presented in the context of the ist project android (active network distributed open infrastructure development), which is developing an autonomous policy-based management system for alan. the preliminary simulation results suggest that with the appropriately optimised parameters, the algorithms developed are scalable, can work effectively in a realistic random network, and allow the policy updates to be distributed efficiently throughout the active network with a lower latency than other similar types of gossip protocols.
@method dendritic cell-based immunotherapy. immunotherapies for human autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases are proliferating rapidly, and with these changes comes the opportunity to monitor patients for immune responses to therapy based on early surrogate markers for clinical responses. class ii tetramers have the potential to serve as these sorts of markers for immune monitoring, and thereby assist with patient management, therapy selection, and improved outcomes. however, important issues of tcr avidity require resolution, because much is still unknown regarding location, quantitation, and characterization of the human t cell response. opportunities for application of tetramer technologies in the near future will enable both clinical progress and the development of new insights into human cd4+ t cell biology in vivo.
@method establishing a professional profile of community health workers: results from a national study of roles, activities and training the community health worker model is recognized nationally as a means to address glaring inequities in the burden of adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups in the united states. this study explored arizona chw involvement in advocacy beyond the individual patient level into the realm of advocating for community level change as a mechanism to reduce the structural underpinnings of health disparities. a survey of chws in arizona found that chws advocate at local, state and federal political levels as well as within health and social service agencies and business. characteristics significantly associated with advocacy include employment in a not for profit organization, previous leadership training, and a work environment that allows flexible work hours and the autonomy to start new projects at work. intrinsic characteristics of chws associated with advocacy include their belief that they can influence community decisions, self perception that they are leaders in the community, and knowledge of who to talk to in their community to make change. community-level advocacy has been identified as a core chw function and has the potential to address structural issues such as poverty, employment, housing, and discrimination. agencies utilizing the chw model could encourage community advocacy by providing a flexible working environment, ongoing leadership training, and opportunities to collaborate with both veteran chws and local community leaders. further research is needed to understand the nature and impact of chw community advocacy activities on both systems change and health outcomes.
@result delineating the genetic heterogeneity of oca in hungarian patients oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a rare genetic disorder of melanin synthesis that results in hypopigmented hair, skin, and eyes. there are four types of oca caused by mutations in tyr (oca‐1), oca2 (oca‐2), tyrp1 (oca‐3), or slc45a2 (oca‐4). here we report 22 novel mutations in the oca genes; 14 from a cohort of 61 patients seen as part of the nih oca natural history study and eight from a prior study at the university of minnesota. we also include a comprehensive list of almost 600 previously reported oca mutations along with ethnicity information, carrier frequencies, and in silico pathogenicity predictions as a supplement. in addition to discussing the clinical and molecular features of oca, we address the cases of apparent missing heritability. in our cohort, 26% of patients did not have two mutations in a single oca gene. we demonstrate the utility of multiple detection methods to reveal mutations missed by sanger sequencing. finally, we review the tyr p.r402q temperature‐sensitive variant and confirm its association with cases of albinism with only one identifiable tyr mutation.
@background what is the value of b-type natriuretic peptide testing for diagnosis, prognosis or monitoring of critically ill adult patients in intensive care? objective:the role of plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) in critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema is controversial. we postulated that a low bnp level would exclude cardiac dysfunction as the principal cause of pulmonary edema and therefore help in the diagnosis of acute lung injury. design:a retrospective derivation cohort was followed by a prospective validation cohort of consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema admitted to three intensive care units. bnp was measured within 24 hrs from onset. critical care experts blinded to bnp results integrated clinical data with the course of disease and response to therapy and served as the reference standard. setting:three intensive care units at the tertiary center. patients:consecutive critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema. interventions:none. measurements and main results:in a derivation cohort of 84 patients, a bnp threshold of ≤250 pg/ml had a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 48% for the diagnosis of acute lung injury. high specificity of bnp (90%, likelihood ratio of 3.9) was confirmed in a validation cohort of 120 consecutive patients, 52 (43%) of whom had acute lung injury. notably, 32% of patients with acute lung injury had concomitant cardiac dysfunction. the median time from the onset of pulmonary edema to bnp testing was 3 hrs. the accuracy of bnp (area under receiver operator curve, 0.71) was comparable with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (area under receiver operator curve, 0.66) and superior to ejection fraction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.60) in subgroups of patients in whom these tests were performed. the accuracy of bnp improved when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded (area under receiver operator curve, 0.82). conclusion:when measured early after the onset of acute pulmonary edema, a bnp level of <250 pg/ml supports the diagnosis of acute lung injury. the high rate of cardiac and renal dysfunction in critically ill patients limits the discriminative role of bnp. no level of bnp could completely exclude cardiac dysfunction.
@result changes in health status for persons with wrist or hand impairments receiving occupational therapy or physical therapy. study design effect of clinical specialization was studied in a retrospective analysis of a commercial outcomes database.   objective to assess effectiveness of care as measured by changes in health status and efficiency as measured by visits, duration of treatment episode, and net revenue between patients treated by clinicians with and without orthopaedic clinical specialist certification (ocs).   background clinical specialization is becoming common in physical therapy, but there are no studies to support improved efficiency or effectiveness with advanced practitioner competencies.   methods and measures a total of 258 adults treated in practices participating in the focus on therapeutic outcomes process during 1996 comprised the data set. seven physical therapists with ocs treated 129 patients (clinical specialist group). these patients were matched to 129 patients not treated by physical therapists with ocs (comparison group) randomly chosen from the aggregate data set. all patients completed a standardized health status questionnaire at initial evaluation and discharge. standardized response means (srms) were calculated to measure change during treatment.   results therapists with ocs were more efficient than therapists without ocs, using fewer visits (9.1 +/- 6.7 vs 11.2 +/- 7.4) for less estimated cost ($949 +/- $736 vs $1238 +/- $1227) during the same treatment duration (35.9 +/- 48.3 vs 35.4 +/- 25.6 days) and performed fewer treatment procedures. overall, there was no difference in effectiveness as measured by change in health status, that is, unit of functional improvement per episode (0.89 +/- 1.0 srm for clinical specialists compared with 0.88 +/- 1.0 srm for comparison group). the ocs group had better value (unit of functional improvement per estimated dollar) and utilization (unit of functional improvement per visit) for the constructs of physical functioning (value: 1.31 +/- 2.7 vs 0.78 +/- 1.8; utilization: 1.25 +/- 2.2 vs 0.76 +/- 1.6) and role physical (value: 1.26 +/- 2.9 vs 0.44 +/- 3.5; utilization: 1.11 +/- 1.9 vs 0.51 +/- 2.3) (srms for ocs group vs comparison group, respectively).   conclusions our data support the conclusion that physical therapists with ocs are more efficient compared with clinicians without ocs. study limitations in design, small sample size, and low number of clinicians are discussed.
@background women’s disempowerment and preference for risky skin whitening products: experimental evidence from india according to the ‘doing well by doing good’ proposition, firms have a corporate social responsibility to achieve some larger social goals, and can do so without a financial sacrifice. this paper empirically tests this proposition by examining in depth the case of ‘fair & lovely,’ a skin whitening cream, marketed by unilever in many countries in asia and africa, and, in particular, india. fair & lovely is indeed doing well; it is a profitable and fast growing brand. it is, however, not doing good, and we demonstrate its negative implications for public welfare. we conclude with thoughts on how to reconcile this divergence between private profits and public welfare.
@result enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (esbls) colonization as a risk factor for developing esbl infections in pediatric cardiac surgery patients: “retrospective cohort study” introduction the incidence of multidrug resistant microorganisms worldwide is increasing. the aim of the study was to present institutional experience with the multidrug resistant microorganism colonization patterns observed in children with congenital heart diseases hospitalized in a hybrid pediatric cardiac surgery center. material and methods microbiological samples were routinely collected in all children admitted to our department. all microbiological samples were analyzed with regard to multidrug resistant microorganisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), gram-negative rods producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), multidrug resistant gram-negative rods (mdr-gnrs), carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (kpc), carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (crab) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (crpa). results in 30 (9%) swabs ‘alert’ pathogens from the above group of listed microorganisms were found. all positive swabs were isolated in 19 (16.1%) children. multidrug resistant pathogen colonization was statistically significantly more often observed in children admitted from other medical facilities than in children admitted from home (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.0089). in the group of children younger than 6 months ‘alert’ pathogen were more often observed than in older children (34.1% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). conclusions preoperative multidrug resistant pathogen screening in children admitted and referred for congenital heart disease procedures may be of great importance since many of these patients are colonized with resistant bacteria. knowledge of the patient's microbiome is important in local epidemiological control along with tailoring the most effective preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for each patient. the impact of preoperative screening on postoperative infections and other complications requires further analysis.
@background inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding: autoradiographic localization in rat brain protein kinase c is a calcium- and phospholipid-stimulated enzyme present in high concentration in the brain. phorbol esters are potent tumor promoters that bind to specific receptors with high affinity. several lines of evidence indicate that the phorbol ester receptor is identical to protein kinase c. to determine the distribution of protein kinase c, we have localized phorbol ester receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography, using [3h]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3h]pdbu) and have performed a variety of lesions to assess the nature of the cellular elements possessing the binding sites. the [3h]pdbu binding sites in the rat brain are discretely localized and primarily associated with neurons. evidence is presented for localization to intrinsic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, terminals of the striatonigral projection, a projection to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and to dendrites of purkinje cells.
@result cases of typhoid fever in copenhagen region: a retrospective study of presentation and relapse we reviewed 232 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary-care hospital under the care of an infectious diseases unit for management of febrile illness acquired overseas. a total of 53% presented to hospital within 1 week of return and 96% within 6 months. malaria was the most common diagnosis (27% of patients), followed by respiratory tract infection (24%), gastroenteritis (14%), dengue fever (8%), and bacterial pneumonia (6%). pretravel vaccination may have prevented a number of admissions, including influenza (n=11), typhoid fever (n=8) and hepatitis a (n=6). compared to those who had not traveled to africa, those who had were 6 times more likely to present with falciparum than nonfalciparum malaria. an itinerary that included asia was associated with a 13-fold increased risk of dengue, but a lower risk of malaria. palpable splenomegaly was associated with an 8-fold risk of malaria and hepatomegaly with a 4-fold risk of malaria. as a cause of fever, bacterial pneumonia was > or =5 times more likely in those who were aged >40 years.
@background cascade bioassay evidence for the existence of urothelium-derived inhibitory factor in guinea pig urinary bladder 1 the effect of adenosine 5′‐triphosphate (atp) on the free cytosolic ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) as measured with the fluorescent ca2+‐indicator fura‐2, and on force was investigated in the intact smooth muscle strips of the mouse urinary bladder. 2 atp elicited, when exogenously applied, a large increase of [ca2+]i with limited force development resulting in a marked ca2+‐force dissociation. 3 release of endogenous neurotransmitters by transmural electrical stimulation (tes) for 30 s induced a steady increase of [ca2+]i and a peak contraction, followed within 15 s by a relaxation. 4 in carbachol‐prestimulated preparations, atp elicited an initial rise of [ca2+]i followed by a return to the initial precontraction ca2+‐level. force in contrast presented a biphasic pattern, i.e. an initial contraction was followed by a sustained relaxation. 5 in the k+‐depolarized precontracted preparation, atp elicited a slight initial rise of [ca2+]i. the partial relaxation of the force during depolarization was not preceded by a transient contraction. 6 the atp‐induced relaxation of the k+‐prestimulated preparations was not inhibited by 8‐phenyltheophylline, a potent p1‐purinoceptor antagonist. 7 the order of potency for relaxation of the atp analogues was 2‐mesatp>atp>βγme‐atp, which is characteristic for p2y‐purinoceptors. 8 these results indicate that, besides its activating effect, atp also relaxes the mouse urinary bladder. it is suggested that the relaxant effect, mediated through p2y‐purinoceptors, is mainly responsible for the low contractile potency of atp in the bladder.
@method after sandy hook elementary: a year in the gun control debate on twitter this paper describes our approach for the detecting stance in tweets task (semeval-2016 task 6). we utilized recent advances in short text categorization using deep learning to create word-level and character-level models. the choice between word-level and character-level models in each particular case was informed through validation performance. our final system is a combination of classifiers using word-level or character-level models. we also employed novel data augmentation techniques to expand and diversify our training dataset, thus making our system more robust. our system achieved a macro-average precision, recall and f1-scores of 0.67, 0.61 and 0.635 respectively.
@background new causally ordered delivery protocol using information of immediate predecessor messages between brokers and subscribers with the sharp increase in heterogeneity and distribution of elements in wide-area networks, more flexible, efficient and autonomous approaches for management and information distribution are needed. this paper proposes a novel approach, based on gossip protocols and firefly synchronisation theory, for the management policy distribution and synchronisation over a number of nodes in an application level active network (alan). the work is presented in the context of the ist project android (active network distributed open infrastructure development), which is developing an autonomous policy-based management system for alan. the preliminary simulation results suggest that with the appropriately optimised parameters, the algorithms developed are scalable, can work effectively in a realistic random network, and allow the policy updates to be distributed efficiently throughout the active network with a lower latency than other similar types of gossip protocols.
@background exploiting the dram microarchitecture to increase memory-level parallelism modern drams have multiple banks to serve multiple memory requests in parallel. however, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of off-chip memory. adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low cost approach. to this end, we propose three new mechanisms that overlap the latencies of different requests that go to the same bank. the key observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern dram bank is implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently while sharing few global peripheral structures. our proposed mechanisms (salp-1, salp-2, and masa) mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. salp-1 requires no changes to the existing dram structure and only needs reinterpretation of some dram timing parameters. salp-2 and masa require only modest changes (<;0.15% area overhead) to the dram peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the dram core. evaluations show that all our schemes significantly improve performance for both single-core systems and multi-core systems. our schemes also interact positively with application-aware memory request scheduling in multi-core systems.
@background the tig 1 histone deacetylase complex regulates infectious growth in the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae antifungal defensins, msdef1 and mtdef4, from medicago spp., inhibit the growth of fusarium graminearum, which causes head blight disease in cereals. in order to determine the signalling cascades that are modulated by these defensins, we have isolated several insertional mutants of f. graminearum that exhibit hypersensitivity to msdef1, but not to mtdef4. the molecular characterization of two of these mutants, designated enhanced sensitivity to defensin (esd), has revealed that the mgv1 and gpmk1 map kinase signalling cascades play a major role in regulating sensitivity of f. graminearum to msdef1, but not to mtdef4. the hog1 map kinase signalling cascade, which is responsible for adaptation of this fungus to hyperosmotic stress, does not participate in the fungal response to these defensins. significantly, the esd mutants also exhibit hypersensitivity to other tested defensins and are highly compromised in their pathogenesis on wheat heads and tomato fruits. the studies reported here for the first time implicate two map kinase signalling cascades in a plant defensin‐mediated alteration of fungal growth. based on our findings, we propose that specific map kinase signalling cascades are essential for protection of a fungal pathogen from the antimicrobial proteins of its host plant.
@result the thoracic anatomy of the male and female winter moth nyssiodes lefuarius (lepidoptera: geometridae) and evolutionary changes in the thorax of moths and butterflies in order to facilitate the study of the evolution of female flightlessness among the geometrid subfamily ennominae (lepidoptera, geometridae), we carried out a phylogenetic analysis based on a morphological data matrix, and dna sequences. we used seven nuclear gene fragments, elongation factor 1alpha (ef-1alpha), wingless (wgl), isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), ribosomal protein s5 (rps5) and segments d1 and d2 of the 28s rrna gene, and one mitochondrial gene fragment, cytochrome oxidase subunit i (coi). sampling included 55 species of ennominae covering all tribes with flightless females of the holarctic boreal zone, and some other geometrids used as outgroups. our results clearly confirmed that ennominae (including alsophila of the traditional subfamily alsophilinae) is a monophyletic group, as well as supported the previously established morphology-based division of ennominae into "ennomine" and "boarmiine" groups of genera. a number of taxonomic ambiguities were resolved but the monophyly of the traditionally recognised tribe bistonini, comprising a number of flightless species, remained ambiguous. bistonini is thus suggested to be subsumed to the tribe boarmiini in the broad sense. indeed, an analysis of timing of divergence suggested that boarmiini s. lat. rapidly diversified in the late oligocene/early miocene. within the ennominae, seven independent origins of female flightlessness were revealed facilitating phylogenetic comparative analyses to be performed in search of causes and consequences of this phenomenon. the present phylogenetic hypothesis supports the conclusions of the "adaptive story", a hypothesis of the sequence of evolutionary events leading to flightlessness, we have presented earlier (snäll et al., 2007). in particular, in the "boarmiine" group, the tribe boarmiini s. lat. clearly represents a group of geometrids in which female flightlessness has evolved more frequently than in any other tribes, suggesting that this clade has likely been predisposed to evolutionary events leading to the manifestation of female flightlessness. the ancestor of the wing-reduced ennominae has likely been a winged but slow flying forest moth feeding polyphagously on deciduous trees.
@background rab8 directs furrow ingression and membrane addition during epithelial formation in drosophila melanogaster cellularization of the drosophila embryo is a specialized form of cytokinesis that results in the formation of a polarized epithelium. the mechanisms of membrane growth during cytokinesis are largely unknown. it is also unclear whether membrane growth and polarization represent distinct processes that occur simultaneously or whether growth of the membrane is involved in the emergence of polarity. using a combination of surface labeling and particles tracking techniques, we monitored the dynamics of marked membrane regions during cellularization. we find that the major source of membrane is intracellular, rather than in the form of a plasma membrane reservoir. depolymerization of microtubules inhibits the export of a newly synthesized transmembrane protein from the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and simultaneously blocks membrane growth. membrane insertion occurs in a defined sequence at specific sites, first apical, then apical–lateral. diffusion of the membrane appears insufficient to compete with the massive local insertion of new membrane. we thus identify a tightly regulated scheme of polarized membrane insertion during cellularization. we propose that such a mechanism could participate in the progressive emergence of apical–basal polarity.
@background what is the value of b-type natriuretic peptide testing for diagnosis, prognosis or monitoring of critically ill adult patients in intensive care? objective:the role of plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) in critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema is controversial. we postulated that a low bnp level would exclude cardiac dysfunction as the principal cause of pulmonary edema and therefore help in the diagnosis of acute lung injury. design:a retrospective derivation cohort was followed by a prospective validation cohort of consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema admitted to three intensive care units. bnp was measured within 24 hrs from onset. critical care experts blinded to bnp results integrated clinical data with the course of disease and response to therapy and served as the reference standard. setting:three intensive care units at the tertiary center. patients:consecutive critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema. interventions:none. measurements and main results:in a derivation cohort of 84 patients, a bnp threshold of ≤250 pg/ml had a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 48% for the diagnosis of acute lung injury. high specificity of bnp (90%, likelihood ratio of 3.9) was confirmed in a validation cohort of 120 consecutive patients, 52 (43%) of whom had acute lung injury. notably, 32% of patients with acute lung injury had concomitant cardiac dysfunction. the median time from the onset of pulmonary edema to bnp testing was 3 hrs. the accuracy of bnp (area under receiver operator curve, 0.71) was comparable with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (area under receiver operator curve, 0.66) and superior to ejection fraction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.60) in subgroups of patients in whom these tests were performed. the accuracy of bnp improved when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded (area under receiver operator curve, 0.82). conclusion:when measured early after the onset of acute pulmonary edema, a bnp level of <250 pg/ml supports the diagnosis of acute lung injury. the high rate of cardiac and renal dysfunction in critically ill patients limits the discriminative role of bnp. no level of bnp could completely exclude cardiac dysfunction.
@method direct and indirect determinants of the patient global assessment in rheumatoid arthritis: differences by level of disease activity a structure for representation of patient outcome is presented, together with a method for outcome measurement and validation of the technique in rheumatoid arthritis. the paradigm represents outcome by five separate dimensions: death, discomfort, disability, drug (therapeutic) toxicity, and dollar cost. each dimension represents an outcome directly related to patient welfare. quantitation of these outcome dimensions may be performed at interview or by patient questionnaire. with standardized, validated questions, similar scores are achieved by both methods. the questionnaire technique is preferred since it is inexpensive and does not require interobserver validation. these techniques appear extremely useful for evaluation of long term outcome of patients with rheumatic diseases.
@background evaluating seroprevalence to circumsporozoite protein to estimate exposure to three species of plasmodium in the brazilian amazon the persistence of malarial antibodies was evaluated in subjects living in a rural community (in minas gerais state, brazil) briefly exposed to a plasmodium vivax malaria outbreak outside of the area in which malaria was endemic. transmission was interrupted by treatment of all patients and their relatives and/or neighbors, although the latter had neither symptoms nor blood parasites. antibodies to p. vivax antigens (recombinant proteins from sporozoites [rpvcs] and from blood stages [rpv200]) were measured in parallel by elisa with sera collected at two time points after transmission. anti-rpvcs igg antibodies were positive in approximately 40% and 20% of the subjects 8 months and 7 years after exposure, respectively. anti-rpv200 igg was first detected in 61% of the subjects who had had malarial symptoms and remained positive in 47% after 7 years. among the prophylactically treated group, anti-rpv200 igg was detected in only 28% after 8 months. the levels of both antibodies decreased with time in all positive subjects.
@background the influence of image resolution on the positron emission tomographic measurement of caudate glucose consumption the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of variations in the size of regions of interest (rois) on values of caudate glucose consumption [regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rcmrglc)] assessed by pet. in addition, we tried to establish the influence of roi size on levels of significance assessing differences in mean caudate glucose consumption between two groups of subjects. for this purpose, rcmrglc was measured using [18f]fluorodeoxyglucose and the pc-4096 pet camera with an in-plane resolution of 7.1 mm in 12 normal subjects and 12 subjects with early huntington disease. caudate rcmrglc was histographically determined using 10 different roi widths ranging from 2 mm, corresponding to the peak value of caudate rcmrglc, to 20 mm. the increase in roi width from 2 to 20 mm led to a significant decrease of caudate rcmrglc by ∼66% in the normal subjects and in the patients. the student t value assessing the differences in mean caudate rcmrglc between the two groups decreased gradually from 5.61 for an roi width of 2 mm to 3.78 for an roi width of 20 mm. this corresponds to a worsening of the level of significance from 10–5 to 10–3, i.e., by a factor of 100. these data show that (given the resolution of presently used pet cameras) the selection of peak values of caudate rcmrglc is the best way to discriminate between groups of subjects supposed to differ with respect to caudate rcmrglc.
@result limit theorems for multifractal products of geometric stationary processes in various fields, such as teletraffic and economics, measured time series have been reported to adhere to multifractal scaling. classical cascading measures possess multifractal scaling, but their increments form a nonstationary process. to overcome this problem, we introduce a construction of random multifractal measures based on iterative multiplication of stationary stochastic processes, a special form of t-martingales. we study the ℒ2-convergence, nondegeneracy, and continuity of the limit process. establishing a power law for its moments, we obtain a formula for the multifractal spectrum and hint at how to prove the full formalism.
@result characterization of rat intestinal microsomal udp-glucuronosyltransferase activity toward mycophenolic acid gastrointestinal surgery was used in order to determine the role of normal food components, bile and pancreatic secretion in the control of mucosal glucuronide synthesis. furthermore a few rats were treated either intragastrically or intraperitoneally with phenobarbitone. both the rate of o-aminophenyl glucuronide synthesis in slices and the activity of udp glucuronyltransferase in mucosal extracts were studied. in partial jejunectomies no changes were found in glucuronide synthesis when compared with the controls, but in jejunal thiry-vella loops and in duodenal and jejunal blind sacs the glucuronide synthesis rate was significantly lower. in gastro-jejunostomized rats a transient increase in the glucuronide synthesis rate was noted in the gastro-jejunostomy area. phenobarbitone administration did not increase the small intestinal udp glucuronyltransferase activity when administered either intraperitoneally or intragastrically. the results indicate that the chyme factors are of importance in the control of glucuronide synthesis in the small intestine of the rat, but that phenobarbitone has no effect.
@background ubiquitin-specific protease 5 is required for the efficient repair of dna double-strand breaks mutations in brca1 are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. brca1 participates in the dna damage response and acts as a ubiquitin ligase. however, its regulation remains poorly understood. here we report that brca1 is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) in response to genotoxic stress, and co-localizes at sites of dna damage with sumo1, sumo2/3 and the sumo-conjugating enzyme ubc9. pias sumo e3 ligases co-localize with and modulate sumo modification of brca1, and are required for brca1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells. in vitro sumo modification of the brca1/bard1 heterodimer greatly increases its ligase activity, identifying it as a sumo-regulated ubiquitin ligase (srubl). further, pias sumo ligases are required for complete accumulation of double-stranded dna (dsdna) damage-repair proteins subsequent to rnf8 accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair. these data demonstrate that the sumoylation pathway plays a significant role in mammalian dna damage response.

@background why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing? humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. for example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. this superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. these models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. a review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. the neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. the hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [r.c. miall, neural computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. by implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.
@method a multi-component prime-boost vaccination regimen with a consensus momp antigen enhances chlamydia trachomatis clearance the majority of vaccine candidates in clinical development are highly purified proteins and peptides relying on adjuvants to enhance and/or direct immune responses. despite the acknowledged need for novel adjuvants, there are still very few adjuvants in licensed human vaccines. a vast number of adjuvants have been tested pre-clinically using different experimental conditions, rendering it impossible to directly compare their activity. we performed a head-to-head comparison of five different adjuvants alum, mf59®, gla-se, ic31® and caf01 in mice and combined these with antigens from m. tuberculosis, influenza, and chlamydia to test immune-profiles and efficacy in infection models using standardized protocols. regardless of antigen, each adjuvant had a unique immunological signature suggesting that the adjuvants have potential for different disease targets. alum increased antibody titers; mf59® induced strong antibody and il-5 responses; gla-se induced antibodies and th1; caf01 showed a mixed th1/th17 profile and ic31® induced strong th1 responses. mf59® and gla-se were strong inducers of influenza hi titers while caf01, gla-se and ic31® enhanced protection to tb and chlamydia. importantly, this is the first extensive attempt to categorize clinical-grade adjuvants based on their immune profiles and protective efficacy to inform a rational development of next generation vaccines for human use.
@background relation between clinical depression risk and physical activity and time spent watching television in older women: a 10-year prospective follow-up study. background: a growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, but there are limited data on black women.purpose: the objective was to evaluate the association between leisure time physical activity and depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.methods: participants included 35,224 women ages 21 to 69 from the blackwomen’s health study, a follow-up study of african american women in which data are collected biennially by mail questionnaire.women answered questions on past and current exercise levels at baseline (1995) and follow-up (1997). the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) was used to measure depressive symptoms in 1999. women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded. we used multivariate logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms (ces-d score <= 16) with control for potential confounders.results: adult vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (or = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.71−0.82) relative to never active women; the or was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% ci = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% ci = 0.77-0.91). although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (body mass index <= 30).conclusions: leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.
@background in ̄ uence of age and predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s on prognosis following complete resection for non-small cell lung carcinoma for men participating in the multiple risk factor intervention trial, the authors evaluated the relation between the baseline forced expiratory volume in one second and lung cancer mortality among smokers between the third and tenth years of follow-up (1973-1974 to 1984). this measure of ventilatory function was a powerful predictor of lung cancer deaths, with rates that increased from 3.02 per 1,000 person-years in the lowest quintile of forced expiratory volume to 0.43 in the highest quintile. this relation was not weakened by adjustments for smoking dose, including number of cigarettes smoked per day, tar and nicotine content, duration of smoking, or age at onset of smoking. nor was forced expiratory volume related to time between its determination and lung cancer death. if these observations can be verified in other studies, the forced expiratory volume in one second may identify smokers at very high risk of lung cancer and, hence, in need of more aggressive preventive approaches.
@background interlimb coordination in patients with parkinson’s disease: motor learning deficits and the importance of augmented information feedback normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or "open-loop" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or "closed-loop" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. in a previous paper it was suggested that parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. in the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. these results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.
@background ccl18 as an independent favorable prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer. cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in the control of many infectious diseases, necessitating the need for adjuvants that can augment cellular immune responses elicited by vaccines. it is well established that protection against one such disease, malaria, requires strong cd8+ t cell responses targeted against the liver stages of the causative agent, plasmodium spp. in this report we show that the dendritic cell-specific chemokine, dendritic cell-derived cc chemokine 1 (dc-ck1), which is produced in humans and acts on naive lymphocytes, can enhance ag-specific cd8+ t cell responses when coadministered with either irradiated plasmodium yoelii sporozoites or a recombinant adenovirus expressing the p. yoelii circumsporozoite protein in mice. we further show that these enhanced t cell responses result in increased protection to malaria in immunized mice challenged with live p. yoelii sporozoites, revealing an adjuvant activity for dc-ck1. dc-ck1 appears to act preferentially on naive mouse lymphocytes, and its adjuvant effect requires il-12, but not ifn-γ or cd40. overall, our results show for the first time an in vivo role for dc-ck1 in the establishment of primary t cell responses and indicate the potential of this chemokine as an adjuvant for vaccines against malaria as well as other diseases in which cellular immune responses are important.

@result hiv entry in macrophages is dependent on intact lipid rafts rice mutant database (rmd, ) is an archive for collecting, managing and searching information of the t-dna insertion mutants generated by an enhancer trap system. we have generated ∼129 000 rice mutant (enhancer trap) lines that are now being gathered in the database. information collected in rmd includes mutant phenotypes, reporter-gene expression patterns, flanking sequences of t-dna insertional sites, seed availability and others, and can be searched by respective id, keyword, nucleotide sequence or protein sequence on the website. this database is both a mutant collection for identifying novel genes and regulatory elements and a pattern line collection for ectopic expression of target gene in specific tissue or at specific growth stage.
@background analysis of epigenetic factors in mouse embryonic neural stem cells exposed to hyperglycemia maternal diabetes causes congenital malformations in various organs including the neural tube in fetuses. in this study, we have analyzed the differential gene expression profiling in the cranial neural tube of embryos from diabetic and control mice by using the oligonucleotide microarray. expression patterns of genes and proteins that are differentially expressed in the cranial neural tube were further examined by the real‐time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. proliferation index and apoptosis were examined by brdu (5‐bromo‐2‐deoxyuridine) labeling and tunel (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick‐end labeling) assay, respectively. embryos (e11.5) of diabetic pregnancies displayed distortion in neuroepithelia of the cranial neural tube. microarray analysis revealed that a total of 390 genes exhibited more than twofold changes in expression level in the cranial neural tube of embryos from diabetic mice. several genes involving apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons in the cranial neural tube were differentially expressed in embryos of diabetic pregnancy. in addition, maternal diabetes perturbed the development of choroid plexus and ventricular systems and reduced the production of proteins such as ttr and igf2 in the developing brain, indicating that these changes could impair the survival and proliferation of neuroepithelial cells and neurogenesis in embryos of diabetic mice. it is concluded that altered expression of a variety of genes involved in brain development is associated with cranial neural tube dysmorphogenesis that may subsequently contribute to intellectual impairment of the offspring of a diabetic mother. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
@background temporal effect of alcohol consumption on reactivity of pial arterioles: role of oxygen radicals. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ethanol exposure on responses of cerebral arterioles in vivo. rats were fed liquid diets with or without ethanol for 2-3 mo. using intravital microscopy, we measured diameter of cerebral arterioles in non-ethanol- and ethanol-fed rats in response to acetylcholine, histamine, adp, the thromboxane analogue (u-46619), and nitroglycerin. in non-ethanol-fed rats, acetylcholine, histamine, and adp produced dose-related dilatation of cerebral arterioles. in ethanol-fed rats, however, acetylcholine produced vasoconstriction, and vasodilatation in response to histamine and adp was impaired. dilatation of cerebral arterioles in response to nitroglycerin and vasoconstriction in response to the thromboxane analogue (u-46619) were similar in non-ethanol-fed and ethanol-fed rats. thus these findings suggest that chronic ethanol exposure impairs responses of cerebral arterioles to agonists, which produce dilatation via the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor. we speculate that impaired vasodilatation coupled with preservation of vasoconstriction in ethanol-fed rats may have important implications for the pathogenesis of stroke during chronic alcohol ingestion.
@background peripheral nerve morphogenesis induced by scaffold micropatterning. this report describes a new approach for fabricating microchannels within three‐dimensional electrospun constructs. these key features serve to mimic the fascicular architecture and fibrous extracellular matrix found in native nerve. both electrospun fibers and multi‐channeled structure nerve guides have become areas of increasing interest for their beneficial roles in nerve repair. however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a guide that incorporates both. multiple parallel channels provide a greater number of defined paths and increased surface area compared to cylindrical guides. additionally, the fibrous nature of electrospun fibers permits better mass transport than solid‐walled constructs. the flexible fabrication scheme allows tailoring of nerve guide parameters such as channel diameters ranging from 33 to 176 µm and various wall thicknesses. channel and fiber structures were assessed by optical and electron microscope images. geometric calculations estimated a porosity of over 85% for these guides with 16% or less from the channels. in vitro culture with schwann cells demonstrated cellular infiltration into channels with restricted migration between fibers. finally, cell proliferation and survival throughout the guide indicates that this design warrants future in vivo examination. biotechnol. bioeng. 2012; 109:1571–1582. © 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.
@method polo-like kinase-1 controls aurora a destruction by activating apc/c-cdh1 we show that human cdc14a phosphatase interacts with interphase centrosomes, and that this interaction is independent of microtubules and cdc14a phosphatase activity, but requires active nuclear export. disrupting the nuclear export signal (nes) led to cdc14a being localized in nucleoli, which in unperturbed cells selectively contain cdc14b (ref. 1). conditional overproduction of cdc14a, but not its phosphatase-dead or nes-deficient mutants, or cdc14b, resulted in premature centrosome splitting and formation of supernumerary mitotic spindles. in contrast, downregulation of endogenous cdc14a by short inhibitory rna duplexes (sirna) induced mitotic defects including impaired centrosome separation and failure to undergo productive cytokinesis. consequently, both overexpression and downregulation of cdc14a caused aberrant chromosome partitioning into daughter cells. these results indicate that cdc14a is a physiological regulator of the centrosome duplication cycle, which, when disrupted, can lead to genomic instability in mammalian cells.
@method the calcium channel blocker verapamil inhibits oxidative stress response in candida albicans abstract the ability of the major systemic fungal pathogen of humans, candida albicans, to sense and respond to reactive oxygen species (ros), such as h2o2 generated by the host immune system, is required for survival in the host. however, the intracellular signaling mechanisms underlying such responses are poorly understood. here, we show that thioredoxin (trx1), in addition to its antioxidant activity, plays a central role in coordinating the response of c. albicans to ros by regulating multiple pathways. in particular, trx1 function is important for h2o2-induced phosphorylation of the hog1 stress-activated protein kinase and to reverse h2o2-induced oxidation and activation of the ap-1 like transcription factor cap1. furthermore, trx1 regulates h2o2-induced hyperpolarized bud growth in a mechanism that involves activation of the rad53 checkpoint kinase. consistent with its key roles in responses to ros, cells lacking trx1 displayed significantly attenuated virulence in a murine model of c. albicans systemic infection. collectively, our data indicate that trx1 has a multifaceted role in h2o2 signaling and promotes c. albicans survival in the host.
@background platypus globin genes and flanking loci suggest a new insertional model for beta-globin evolution in birds and mammals we have explored the evolution of the alpha-globin gene family by comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses of mammalian alpha-globin genes. our analyses reveal the existence of a new alpha-globin gene lineage in mammals that is related to the alpha(d)-globin genes of birds, squamates and turtles. the gene is located in the middle of the alpha-globin gene cluster of a marsupial, sminthopsis macroura and of humans. it exists in a wide variety of additional mammals, including pigs, cows, cats, and dogs, but is a pseudogene in american marsupials. evolutionary analyses suggest that the gene has generally evolved under purifying selection, indicative of a functional gene. the presence of mrna products in humans, pigs, and cows also suggest that the gene is expressed and likely to be functional. the analyses support the hypothesis that the alpha(d)-globin gene lineage has an ancient evolutionary origin that predates the divergence of amniotes. the structural similarity of alpha-globin gene clusters of marsupials and humans suggest that an eight gene cluster (5'-zeta2-zeta1-alpha(d)-alpha3-alpha2-alpha1-theta-omega-3'), including seven alpha-like genes and one beta-like globin gene (omega-globin) existed in the common ancestor of all marsupial and eutherian mammals. this basic structure has remained relatively stable in marsupials and in the lineage leading to humans, although omega-globin has been lost from the alpha-globin gene cluster of humans.
@background regularized lda based on separable scatter matrices for classification of spatio-spectral eeg patterns linear discriminant analysis (lda) is a well-known scheme for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of labeled data in a vector space. lda has been extended to two-dimensional lda (2dlda), which is an iterative algorithm for data in matrix representation. in this paper, we propose non-iterative algorithms for 2dlda. experimental results show that the non-iterative algorithms achieve competitive recognition rates with the iterative 2dlda, while they are computationally more efficient than the iterative 2dlda
@background intervertebral disc herniation in adolescents. study design. the authors examined a case series of patients under the age of 18 years treated for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. objectives. to evaluate postoperative and long-term results of surgery in patients younger than 18 years. summary of background data. there are only a few series, with controversial results, available on the surgical treatment of disc herniation in growing patients. methods. between 1975 and 1991, a consecutive series of 129 patients 9–18 years of age (average age, 16.2 years) underwent surgery for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. low back pain associated with leg pain was the main clinical symptom in 106 subjects (82%), back pain in 17 (13%), and leg pain in 6 (5%). results. short-term results were excellent or good for 123 cases (95%), with complete pain relief in 97 (75%) and moderate but incomplete relief in 26 (20%). a total of 98 (76%) long-term responses obtained at a mean follow-up of 12.4 years revealed excellent outcomes in 40% of the cases, good in 47%, and poor in 13%. ten patients (10%) underwent reintervention after 9 years on average (2 fusions and 8 re-explorations for herniated disc). conclusions. results have confirmed a tendency for outcomes to deteriorate between the short-term and long-term follow-up in young patients treated by discectomy: this tendency and the rate of reintervention (10%) confirmed the need for long-term follow-up of children and adolescents treated for disc herniation.
@background elevated plasma adiponectin and decreased plasma homocysteine and asymmetric dimethylarginine in children with type 1 diabetes adiponectin, also referred to as acrp30, adipoq, and gbp28, is a plasma protein exclusively produced by adipose tissue and a possible insulin-sensitizing agent (1–6). serum adiponectin levels are negatively correlated to bmi in healthy individuals and decreased in type 2 diabetic patients (1–6). however, serum adiponectin levels in type 1 diabetes have not been elucidated.  we examined the serum adiponectin concentrations in 46 type 1 diabetic patients (21 males and 25 females) and compared them with those of bmi-matched healthy control subjects (17 males and 19 females). mean age was 33 ± 3 and 33 ± 4 years, bmi was 19.8 ± 0.5 and 19.9 ± 0.6 kg/m2, hba1c level was 9.7± 0.7 and 10.4 ± 0.6%, duration of diabetes was 3.2 ± 0.9 and 3.4 ± 1.3 years, and urinary c-peptide excretion was 18.4 ± 4.3 and 18.0 ± 2.4 μg/day in male and …
@result assessing inhibitory control in early‐stage alzheimer's and parkinson's disease using the hayling sentence completion test successful communication requires speakers to consider their listeners׳ perspectives. little is known about how this ability changes in alzheimer׳s disease (ad) although such knowledge could reveal the cognitive mechanisms fundamental to perspective-taking ability, and reveal which cognitive deficits are fundamental to communication disorders in ad. patients with mild to moderate ad and age and education matched controls were tested in a communicative perspective-taking task, and on measures of executive control, general cognitive functioning, and lexical retrieval. patients׳ ability to perform the perspective-taking task was significantly correlated with performance on measures of general cognitive functioning, visual scanning and construction, response conflict and attention. measures of lexical retrieval tended not to be correlated with performance on the communication task with one exception: semantic but not letter fluency predicted a derived score of perspective-taking ability. these findings broaden our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective taking, and suggest that impairments in perspective taking in ad occur during utterance planning, and at a relatively early processing stage which involves rapid visual scanning and problem solving, rather than during retrieval of lexical items needed to speak. more broadly, these data reveal executive function and semantic deficits, but not problems with lexical retrieval, as more fundamental to the basis of cognitive changes associated with ad.
@background signal processing using singular spectrum analysis for nonlinear system identification support vector machines is a powerful methodology for solving problems in nonlinear classification, function estimation and density estimation which has also led recently to many new developments in kernel based learning in general. in these methods one solves convex optimization problems, typically quadratic programs. we focus on least squares support vector machines which are reformulations to standard svms that lead to solving linear kkt systems. least squares support vector machines are closely related to regularization networks and gaussian processes but additionally emphasize and exploit primaldual interpretations from optimization theory. in view of interior point algorithms such ls-svm kkt systems can be considered as a core problem. where needed the obtained solutions can be robustified and/or sparsified. as an alternative to a top-down choice of the cost function, methods from robust statistics are employed in a bottom-up fashion for further improving the estimates. we explain the natural links between ls-svm classifiers and kernel fisher discriminant analysis. the framework is further extended towards unsupervised learning by considering pca analysis and its kernel version as a one-class modelling problem. this leads to new primal-dual support vector machine formulations for kernel pca and kernel canonical correlation analysis. furthermore, ls-svm formulations are mentioned towards recurrent networks and control, thereby extending the methods from static to dynamic problems. in general, support vector machines may pose heavy computational challenges for large data sets. for this purpose, we propose a method of fixed size ls-svm where the estimation is done in the primal space in relation to a nyström sampling with active selection of support vectors and we discuss extensions to committee networks. the methods will be illustrated by several benchmark and real-life applications.
@background signal and noise in p300 recordings to visual stimuli to examine the topographic relationship of p3(00) between the visual and auditory modalities, especially to examine whether there are any modality-specific hemispheric differences of p3 in normal adults. methods: the p3s were recorded from the same 41 normal right-handed males between the ages of 20 and 33 in both a typical auditory oddball task and a visual oddball paradigm with novel stimuli, with an extensive set of 61 scalp electrodes. in addition to the visual comparison and quantitative assessment of current source density (csd) maps between the two modalities, canonical correlation analyses on the p3 raw amplitudes and examination of interaction effects of modality × location on both raw and normalized p3 data were performed. results: the canonical correlation between modalities was generally high, especially at the left parietal brain region. there were no significant hemispheric effects in anterior brain but significant left-greater- than-right hemispheric effects in posterior brain regions in both modalities; modality-specific hemispheric effect was observed only at the parietal region. strong surface current density activities were observed in the midline parietal-occipital area, and left and right boundary areas of temporal and inferior frontal region. conclusions: the topographic similarities between p3s recorded in the visual and auditory modality outnumber the differences. combining data from csd assessments and profile analysis of p3 topography support the hypothesis of multiple generators of p3 that are differentially active in processing stimuli from different sensory modalities and are not symmetrically distributed between the two hemispheres.
@background running time analysis of the ($$1+1$$1+1)-ea for onemax and leadingones under bit-wise noise a combination tow and pressure relief valve for use in a hydraulic fluid circuit used in a hydraulically driven wide area lawn mower. the valve includes a cylindrical valve body having a hexagonal head. a slideable valve tip with a shank and a valve head has its shank slidably mounted within the valve body. the valve tip is biased by a spring to move in a direction away from the hex head. in operation, the valve is inserted into a suitable chamber placed in series with a bypass passage. the valve tends to block the bypass passage under steady state conditions. when a surge in hydraulic pressure occurs, as would occur in response to operator input or at startup, the hydraulic fluid overcomes the bias of the spring and urges the valve tip away from the otherwise blocked orifice which links the bypass passage to the chamber. opening the orifice tends to diminish the magnitude of the pressure peak and helps eliminate jerky starts of the mower. the spring eventually overcomes the reduced hydraulic fluid pressure and returns the head of the valve tip into a sealed relationship with the bypass passage orifice. a shoulder nut permits the valve to be secured at a fixed position within the chamber. varying the position of the valve within the chamber permits adjustment of the absolute value of the peak pressure which will be reached within the bypass passage. loosening the valve further permits its use as a tow valve, so that the associated mower can be moved without skidding of the mower tires or actually starting the mower engine. closing the valve further permits maximum operating pressure availability for larger and heavier equipment.
@method an efficient mixed-mode bist technique a new design methodology for a pattern generator is proposed, formulated in the context of on-chip bist. the design methodology is circuit-specific and uses synthesis techniques to design bist generators. the pattern generator consists of two components: a pseudorandom pattern generator (like an lfsr or, preferably, a glfsr) and a combinational logic to map the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. this combinational logic is synthesized to produce a given set of target patterns by mapping the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. it is shown that, for a particular cut, an area-efficient combinational logic block can be designed/synthesized to achieve 100 (or almost 100) percent single stuck-at fault coverage using a small number of test the this method is significantly different from weighted pattern generation and can guarantee testing of all hard-to-detect faults without expensive test point insertion. experimental results on common benchmark netlists demonstrate that the fault coverage of the proposed pattern generator is significantly higher compared to conventional pattern generation techniques. the design technique for the logic mapper is unique and can be used effectively to improve existing pattern generators for combinational logic and scan-based bist structures.
@background genome-wide identification, classification and expression analysis of ghmp genes family in arabidopsis thaliana kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of sugars, called here sugar kinases, can be divided into at least three distinct nonhomologous families. the first is the hexokinase family, which contains many prokaryotic and eukaryotic sugar kinases with diverse specificities, including a new member, rhamnokinase from salmonella typhimurium. the three‐dimensional structure of hexokinase is known and can be used to build models of functionally important regions of other kinases in this family. the second is the ribokinase family, of unknown three‐dimensional structure, and comprises pro‐ and eukaryotic ribokinases, bacterial fructokinases, the minor 6‐phosphofructokinase 2 from escherichia coli, 6‐phosphotagatokinase, 1‐phosphofructokinase, and, possibly, inosine‐guanosine kinase. the third family, also of unknown three‐dimensional structure, contains several bacterial and yeast galactokinases and eukaryotic mevalonate and phosphomevalonate kinases and may have a substrate binding region in common with homoserine kinases.
@background extended effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary mortality in vienna air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants. the former include nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and sulphur dioxide (so2). the latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points—for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (pm10) or ,2.5 mm (pm2.5). because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. why should cardiologists care about ambient air? it has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the meuse valley fog of 1930 or the london smog of 1952. these episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. however, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs. maı̂tre et al. gathered the available epidemiological evidence on the association between coronary disease and air pollution at current ambient concentrations. from both biological and public health perspectives, one should distinguish between acute and long-term effects of air pollution.
@background epifluorescent direct counts of bacteria and viruses from topsoil of various desert dust storm regions. charles darwin, like others before him, collected aeolian dust over the atlantic ocean and sent it to christian gottfried ehrenberg in berlin. ehrenberg's collection is now housed in the museum of natural history and contains specimens that were gathered at the onset of the industrial revolution. geochemical analyses of this resource indicated that dust collected over the atlantic in 1838 originated from the western sahara, while molecular-microbiological methods demonstrated the presence of many viable microbes. older samples sent to ehrenberg from barbados almost two centuries ago also contained numbers of cultivable bacteria and fungi. many diverse ascomycetes, and eubacteria were found. scanning electron microscopy and cultivation suggested that bacillus megaterium, a common soil bacterium, was attached to historic sand grains, and it was inoculated onto dry sand along with a non-spore-forming control, the gram-negative soil bacterium rhizobium sp. ngr234. on sand b. megaterium quickly developed spores, which survived for extended periods and even though the numbers of ngr234 steadily declined, they were still considerable after months of incubation. thus, microbes that adhere to saharan dust can live for centuries and easily survive transport across the atlantic.
@background weight loss maintenance in african american women: a systematic review of the behavioral lifestyle intervention literature context behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common.   objective to compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group.   design, setting, and participants two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% african american, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred august 2003-july 2004 and randomization, february-december 2004. data collection was completed in june 2007.   interventions after the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. main outcome changes in weight from randomization.   results mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. during the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. after randomization, weight regain occurred. participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; p = .001). at 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% ci, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; p = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% ci, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; p = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% ci, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; p = .04). at 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% ci -2.1 to -0.3; p = .008). effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight.   conclusions the majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00054925.
@background quantitative characterization of functional anatomical contributions to cognitive control under uncertainty tasks involving conflict between stimulus dimensions have been shown to activate dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas. it has been proposed that the dorsal anterior cingulate is involved a domain general process of monitoring conflict, while prefrontal areas are involved in resolving conflict. we examine three tasks that all require people to respond based on one stimulus dimension while ignoring another conflicting dimension, but which vary in the source of conflict. one of the tasks uses language stimuli (stroop effect) and two use nonlanguage spatial conflicts appropriate for children and nonhuman animals. in experiment 1, 12 participants were studied with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while performing each of the three tasks. reaction times for each of the three tasks were significantly longer in the incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition, demonstrating that each task elicits a conflict. by studying the same people in the same session, we test the hypothesis that conflict activates a similar brain network in the three tasks. significant activations were found in the anterior cingulate and left prefrontal cortex for all three conflict tasks. within these regions, the conflict component demonstrated evidence for significant common activation across the three tasks, although the peak activation point and spatial extent were not identical. other areas demonstrated activation unique to each task. experiments 2-4 provide behavioral evidence indicating considerable independence between conflict operations involved in the tasks. the behavioral and fmri results taken together seem to argue against a single unified network for processing conflict, but instead support either distinct networks for each conflict task or a single network that monitors conflict with different sites used to resolve the conflict.
@background exploiting partial reconfiguration through pcie for a microphone array network emulator the use of microphone arrays for sound-source localization is a well-researched topic. the response of such sensor arrays is dependent on the quantity of microphones operating on the array. a higher number of microphones, however, increase the computational demand, making real-time response challenging. in this paper, we present a filter-and-sum based architecture and several acceleration techniques to provide accurate sound-source localization in real-time. experiments demonstrate how an accurate sound-source localization is obtained in a couple of milliseconds, independently of the number of microphones. finally, we also propose different strategies to further accelerate the sound-source localization while offering increased angular resolution.
@method results of osteochondral autologous transplantation in the knee purpose the purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of mosaic-type osteochondral autologous transplantation (oat) and microfracture (mf) procedures for the treatment of the articular cartilage defects of the knee joint in young active athletes.   type of study prospective randomized clinical study.   methods between 1998 and 2002, a total of 60 athletes with a mean age of 24.3 years (range, 15 to 40 years) and with a symptomatic lesion of the articular cartilage in the knee were randomized to undergo either an oat or an mf procedure. only those athletes playing in competitive sports at regional or national levels were included in the study. fifty-seven athletes (95%) were available for a follow-up. there were 28 athletes in the oat group and 29 athletes in the mf group. the mean duration of symptoms was 21.32 +/- 5.57 months and the mean follow-up was 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months), and none of the athletes had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. patients were evaluated using modified hospital for special surgery (hss) and international cartilage repair society (icrs) scores, radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (mri), and clinical assessment. an independent observer performed a follow-up examination after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. at 12.4 months postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histologic evaluation was carried out. a radiologist and a pathologist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment, did the radiologic and histologic evaluations.   results after 37.1 months, both groups had significant clinical improvement (p < .05). according to the modified hss and icrs scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after oat compared with 52% for the mf procedure (p < .001). at 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery, the hss and icrs showed statistically significantly better results in the oat group (p = .03; p = .006; p = .006). younger athletes did better in both groups. no serious complications were reported. there was 1 failure in the oat group and 9 in the mf group. the icrs cartilage repair assessment for macroscopic evaluation during arthroscopy at 12.4 months showed excellent or good repairs in 84% after oat and in 57% after mf. biopsy specimens were obtained from 58% of the patients and histologic evaluation of repair showed better scores (according to icrs) for the oat group (p < .05). mri evaluation showed excellent or good repairs in 94% after oat compared with 49% after mf. twenty-six (93%) oat patients and 15 (52%) mf patients returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4 to 8 months). others showed a decline in sports activity level.   conclusions at an average of 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months) follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in young active athletes under the age of 40 has shown significant superiority of oat over mf for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. we found that only 52% of mf athletes could return to sports at the preinjury level. limitations of our study included a small number of athletes and a relatively short (3-year) follow-up. a long-term follow-up is needed to assess the durability of articular cartilage repair using these methods in young active athletes.   level of evidence level i, therapeutic study, randomized controlled trial, significant difference (a).
@background joint position sense during a reaching task improves at targets located closer to the head but is unaffected by instruction our understanding of age-related declines in upper limb proprioceptive abilities is limited. furthermore, the extent to which physical activity might ameliorate age-related changes in proprioception is not known. upper limb proprioceptive acuity was examined in young and older (active and sedentary) right-handed adults using a wrist-position-matching task that varied in terms of processing demands. older individuals were also classified according to their participation in tasks specific to the upper limb. errors were greater for older than younger individuals. older sedentary adults showed greater errors and performed movements less smoothly than older active adults. the nonspecific group showed greater errors and longer movement times than the upper-limb-specific group. in older adults, decreased ability to perceive limb position may be related to a sedentary lifestyle and declines associated with memory and transfer of proprioceptive information. performing tasks specific to the upper limbs may reduce age-related declines in proprioception.
@background behavioural mechanisms of invasion and displacement in pacific island geckos (hemidactylus) since the age of exploration began, there has been a drastic breaching of biogeographic barriers that previously had isolated the continental biotas for millions of years. we explore the nature of these recent biotic exchanges and their consequences on evolutionary processes. the direct evidence of evolutionary consequences of the biotic rearrangements is of variable quality, but the results of trajectories are becoming clear as the number of studies increases. there are examples of invasive species altering the evolutionary pathway of native species by competitive exclusion, niche displacement, hybridization, introgression, predation, and ultimately extinction. invaders themselves evolve in response to their interactions with natives, as well as in response to the new abiotic environment. flexibility in behavior, and mutualistic interactions, can aid in the success of invaders in their new environment.
@background μ-opioid receptors: correlation of agonist efficacy for signalling with ability to activate internalization we investigated the ability of the activated μ‐opioid receptor (mor) to differentiate between myristoylated gαi1 and gαoa type g proteins, and the maximal activity of a range of synthetic and endogenous agonists to activate each g protein. membranes from hek293 cells stably expressing transfected mor were chaotrope extracted to denature endogenous g‐proteins and reconstituted with specific purified g‐proteins. the g subunits were generated in bacteria and were demonstrated to be recognised equivalently to bovine brain purified g protein by cb1 cannabinoid receptors. the ability of agonists to catalyse the mor‐dependent gdp/[35s]gtps exchange was then compared for gαi1 and gαoa. activation of mor by damgo produced a high‐affinity saturable interaction for gαoa (km=20±1 nm) but a low‐affinity interaction with gαi1 (km=116±12 nm). damgo, met‐enkephalin and leucine‐enkephalin displayed maximal g activation among the agonists evaluated. endomorphins 1 and 2, methadone and β‐endorphin activated both g to more than 75% of the maximal response, whereas fentanyl partially activated both g‐proteins. buprenorphine and morphine demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the maximal activities between gαi1 and gαoa. interestingly, damgo, morphine, endomorphins 1 and 2, displayed significant differences in the potencies for the activation of the two g. differences in maximal activity and potency, for gαi1 versus gαoa, are both indicative of agonist selective activation of g‐proteins in response to mor activation. these findings may provide a starting point for the design of drugs that demonstrate greater selectivity between these two g‐proteins and therefore produce a more limited range of effects.
@background obesity exacerbates sepsis-induced oxidative damage in organs there is strong evidence indicating that excess adiposity negatively impacts immune function and host defence in obese individuals. this is a review of research findings concerning the impact of obesity on the immune response to infection, including a discussion of possible mechanisms. obesity is characterised by a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. the impact of these metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related comorbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decade. however, relatively little is known of how the immune system and host defence are influenced by the pro-inflammatory and excess energy milieu of the obese. epidemiological data suggest obese human subjects are at greater risk for nosocomial infections, especially following surgery. additionally, the significance of altered immunity in obese human subjects is emphasised by recent studies reporting obesity to be an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality following infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) virus. rodent models offer important insight into how metabolic abnormalities associated with excess body weight can impair immunity. however, more research is necessary to understand the specific aspects of immunity that are impaired and what factors are contributing to reduced immunocompetence in the obese. additionally, special consideration of how infection in this at-risk population is managed is required, given that this population may not respond optimally to antimicrobial drugs and vaccination. obesity impacts millions globally, and greater understanding of its associated physiological disturbances is a key public health concern.
@method the application of spatio-temporal feature and multi-sensor in home medical devices the aim of this paper is to address recognition of natural human actions in diverse and realistic video settings. this challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. we evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. we present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear svms. the method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard kth action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. we finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results.
@method impact of antiretroviral pressure on selection of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope sequences in vitro. it has been reported that the addition of a potential n-linked glycosylation site (pngs) to the gp120 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) envelope glycoprotein provides protection against neutralizing antibodies (nabs) by acting as a 'glycan shield'. in this study, we induced insertion of a pngs into the v2 region of hiv-1(bal) with the kd-247 anti-v3 neutralizing monoclonal antibody. in the presence of kd-247 (200 microg ml(-1)) at passage five, viruses with 3 aa mutations in the c2 (t240s and i283t) and v3 (t319a) regions expanded from pre-existing variants. after six passages with kd-247 (>300 microg ml(-1)), a pngs emerged in the v2 region in addition to c2 (t240s) and v3 mutations (r315k and f317l). a variant with a pngs insertion in v2, but no v3 mutations was sensitive to kd-247, whereas a clone with a v2 pngs insertion and mutations in v3 demonstrated a high level of resistance to kd-247. replication kinetic analysis revealed that the f317l mutation in v3 played a compensatory role for fitness-loss caused by the pngs insertion in v2. the evading hiv-1 variant did not revert back to the wild-type virus after 14 passages without kd-247. these findings demonstrate that the virus with fitness-loss mutations can replicate equally as well as the wild-type virus to acquire some key mutations in the v3 stem and the c2 region, and the compensated variants containing pngs do not revert back to the ancestral virus even in the absence of nab.
@method assessment of genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships based on ribosomal dna repeat unit length variation and internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences in chickpea (cicer arietinum) cultivars and its wild species molecular phylogeny based on internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences was studied to resolve the taxonomic contradiction in vigna and its relation to phaseolus. the its region of the 18s-26s nuclear ribosomal dna repeat was sequenced for 29 vigna species, selected from five of the nine subgenera, and 9 species of phaseolus. the length of its-1 ranged from 187 to 243 bp and 217 to 290 bp, and that of its-2 from 187 to 219 bp and 225 to 243 bp, within vigna and phaseolus species, respectively. phylogenies derived from its sequences based on maximum-parsimony and neighbor-joining methods gave trees essentially of similar topology. the its phylogeny was generally congruent with recent classifications based largely on morphological, biochemical, cytogenetical, and palynological features, except that subgenus plectotropis of neotropical origin was revealed to be closely related to subgenus vigna instead of forming a link between african (subgenus vigna) and asiatic (subgenus ceratotropis) vignas, and subgenus sigmoidotropis, featuring morphological characters of both vigna and phaseolus, was placed as the sister group to the phaseolus taxa. the its sequences were shown to be useful for identifying wild progenitors of v. mungo, v. radiata, v. umbellata, and v. unguiculata and for clarifying taxonomy-related problems in many previously controversial cases. this study also affirms that v. umbellata and v. angularis are the diploid progenitors of the only tetraploid species (v. glabrescens) known in the genus.
@method species diversity and functional assessment of macroinvertebrate communities in austrian rivers an exact expression is given for the jackknife estimate of the number of species in a community and for the variance of this number when quadrat sampling procedures are used. the jackknife estimate is a function of the number of species that occur in one and only one quadrat. the variance of the number of species can be constructed, as can approximate two-sided confidence intervals. the behavior of the jackknife estimate, as affected by quadrat size, sample size and sampling area, is investigated by simulation.
@method exclusionary interactions among diverse fungi infecting developing seeds of centaurea stoebe. fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
@background polyanalgesic consensus conference—2012: recommendations to reduce morbidity and mortality in intrathecal drug delivery in the treatment of chronic pain objectives:the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal narcotics pump (itnp) as an alternative treatment for patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis (cp). itnp offers the advantages of reversibility, lower total narcotic dose, and the pancreas remaining intact.methods:thirteen patients (8 female, 5 male), with mean age 40.6 years (s.d. 9.6 years), who had experienced intractable upper abdominal pain from cp were reviewed. each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). they were offered itnp after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. etiologies of cp included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).results:the median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to itnp was 6 years (2–22 years). the median follow-up time after itnp was 29 months (range, 7–94 months). the itnp was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5–94 months). seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). there were no deaths. the mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (p<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (p<0.01). the median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after itnp were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5 mg per day (range, 67.5–1,320) and 40 mg per day (range, 0–1,680), respectively (p<0.01). two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. one patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. therefore, the overall success rate of itnp based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). the major complications of itnp were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).conclusions:this study shows the many risks and benefits of itnp. a longer follow-up is awaited; such pumps appear to be one alternative to aggressive surgical intervention. failed itnp trials leave other options open. therapeutic trials directly comparing pancreatectomy, itnp, and implanted nerve stimulators are of interest.
@result multiple mechanisms for processing reward uncertainty in the primate basal forebrain it has been suggested that the basal forebrain (bf) exerts strong influences on the formation of memory and behavior. however, what information is used for the memory-behavior formation is unclear. we found that a population of neurons in the medial bf (medial septum and diagonal band of broca) of macaque monkeys encodes a unique combination of information: reward uncertainty, expected reward value, anticipation of punishment, and unexpected reward and punishment. the results were obtained while the monkeys were expecting (often with uncertainty) a rewarding or punishing outcome during a pavlovian procedure, or unexpectedly received an outcome outside the procedure. in vivo anterograde tracing using manganese-enhanced mri suggested that the major recipient of these signals is the intermediate hippocampal formation. based on these findings, we hypothesize that the medial bf identifies various contexts and outcomes that are critical for memory processing in the hippocampal formation.
@method the addition of bicalutamide 150 mg to radiotherapy significantly improves overall survival in men with locally advanced prostate cancer to evaluate, in the ongoing early prostate cancer (epc) trial programme, the efficacy and tolerability of bicalutamide 150 mg once daily in addition to standard care for localized or locally advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
@background sex-dependent responses to increased parental effort in the pied flycatcher a fundamental premise of life‐history theory is that organisms that increase current reproductive investment suffer increased mortality. possibly the most studied life‐history phenotypic relationship is the trade‐off between parental effort and survival. however, evidence supporting this trade‐off is equivocal. here, we conducted a meta‐analysis to test the generality of this tenet. using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. our results suggest that the trade‐off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life‐history trade‐offs.
@method increased glutathione biosynthesis plays a role in nickel tolerance in thlaspi nickel hyperaccumulators copper tolerance among arabidopsis ecotypes is inversely correlated with long-term k(+) leakage and positively correlated with short-term k(+) leakage (a. murphy, l. taiz [1997] new phytol 136: 211-222). to probe the mechanism of the early phase of k(+) efflux, we tested various channel blockers on copper and peroxide-induced k(+) efflux from seedling roots. the k(+) channel blockers tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-aminopyridine (4-ap) both inhibited short-term copper-induced k(+) efflux. in contrast, peroxide-induced k(+) efflux was insensitive to both tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-ap. copper-induced lipid peroxidation exhibited a lag time of 4 h, while peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation began immediately. these results suggest that short-term copper-induced k(+) efflux is mediated by channels, while peroxide-induced k(+) efflux represents leakage through nonspecific lesions in the lipid bilayer. tracer studies with (86)rb(+) confirmed that copper promotes k(+) efflux rather than inhibiting k(+) uptake. short-term k(+) release is electroneutral, since electrophysiological measurements indicated that copper does not cause membrane depolarization. short-term k(+) efflux was accompanied by citrate release, and copper increased total citrate levels. since citrate efflux was blocked by 4-ap, k(+) appears to serve as a counterion during copper-induced citrate efflux. as copper but not aluminum selectively induces citrate production and release, it is proposed that copper may inhibit a cytosolic form of aconitase.
@method semi-supervised learning with committees: exploiting unlabeled data using ensemble learning algorithms this paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. this is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.we introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of expectation-maximization (em) and a naive bayes classifier. the algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. it then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. this basic em procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. however these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. we present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%.
@method weight optimization for discourse-level smt we collected a corpus of parallel text in 11 languages from the proceedings of the european parliament, which are published on the web1. this corpus has found widespread use in the nlp community. here, we focus on its acquisition and its application as training data for statistical machine translation (smt). we trained smt systems for 110 language pairs, which reveal interesting clues into the challenges ahead.
@background the effect of non-enzymatic glycation of extracellular matrix proteins on axonal regeneration in vitro abstract the pattern of collagenisation in peripheral nerve in diabetic polyneuropathy was examined in nerve biopsy specimens from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy in comparison with organ donor control nerves and disease controls (other neuropathies). there was increased endoneurial collagenisation both in the diabetic polyneuropathy cases and the disease controls, this predominantly involving types i and iii. type ii collagen was not detected in organ donor control nerves or in the diabetic and the disease control nerves. there was a relative increase in type vi collagen in the endoneurium in the diabetic nerves immediately surrounding groups of schwann cells. this was not a feature in the other neuropathies. the quantity of types iv, v and vi collagen was increased around the endoneurial microvessels in the diabetic patients and, to a lesser extent, in those with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (hmsn). increased deposition of types iv and v collagen was observed in the perineurium in the diabetic nerves, the latter being most evident in the innermost lamellae where the amount of laminin was possibly also increased. the diameter of the general endoneurial collagen fibrils was greater in the diabetic nerves, although this was not more than in a disease control (hmsn). the collagen fibrils that were present within the basal laminal tubes that had surrounded degenerated myelinated fibres in the diabetic nerves, and those within the onion bulbs of the hmsn cases, were of the normal endoneurial calibre. the expression of laminin by büngner bands in diabetic neuropathy did not differ from that in disease control nerves, nor were any differences detected for fibronectin. whether the changes observed are important for the impaired regenerative capacity in diabetic neuropathy requires further investigation.
@background kin effects on energy allocation in group-living ground squirrels. since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
@method a search for snca 3′ utr variants identified snp rs356165 as a determinant of disease risk and onset age in parkinson’s disease few detailed clinico-pathological correlations of parkinson's disease have been published. the pathological findings in 100 patients diagnosed prospectively by a group of consultant neurologists as having idiopathic parkinson's disease are reported. seventy six had nigral lewy bodies, and in all of these lewy bodies were also found in the cerebral cortex. in 24 cases without lewy bodies, diagnoses included progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, alzheimer's disease, alzheimer-type pathology, and basal ganglia vascular disease. the retrospective application of recommended diagnostic criteria improved the diagnostic accuracy to 82%. these observations call into question current concepts of parkinson's disease as a single distinct morbid entity.
@method identification of human ikk-2 inhibitors of natural origin (part i): modeling of the ikk-2 kinase domain, virtual screening and activity assays we have recently identified bms-345541 (1) as a highly selective and potent inhibitor of ikk-2 (ic50 = 0.30 microm), which however was considerably less potent against ikk-1 (ic50 = 4.0 microm). in order to further explore the sar around the imidazoquinoxaline tricyclic structure of 1, we prepared a series of tetracyclic analogues (7, 13, and 18). the synthesis and biological activities of these potent ikk inhibitors are described.
@background are public and private r&d investments complements or substitutes? economic interest in innovation policy largely arises from the fundamental importance of innovation to social welfare and from inefficiencies in innovation in a competitive market environment. as a result, a wide variety of public innovation policies are used in practice. this study reviews the economic justifications for public innovation policies and compares the existing policy tools, paying particular attention to the finnish innovation policy environment.
@background inflammatory cells, microglia and mhc class ii antigen-positive cells in the spinal cord of lewis rats with acute and chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (cns), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen cd45, many cells were coisolated that were mrc ox42+ (complement receptor 3/cd11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of cd45 and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules. most cells from normal cns, in contrast, lay within this latter, cd45low population. from previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated cd45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating cd45, cd4, and mhc class i molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of mhc class ii molecules. a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed cns provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. in normal cns, a very small population of blood-derived cd45high-expressing cells are present; most mhc class ii expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.
@result bifactor modeling and the estimation of model-based reliability in the wais-iv the present study examined the factor structure of the wechsler adult intelligence scale--fourth edition (wais-iv; d. wechsler, 2008a) standardization sample using exploratory factor analysis, multiple factor extraction criteria, and higher order exploratory factor analysis (j. schmid & j. m. leiman, 1957) not included in the wais-iv technical and interpretation manual (d. wechsler, 2008b). results indicated that the wais-iv subtests were properly associated with the theoretically proposed first-order factors, but all but one factor-extraction criterion recommended extraction of one or two factors. hierarchical exploratory analyses with the schmid and leiman procedure found that the second-order g factor accounted for large portions of total and common variance, whereas the four first-order factors accounted for small portions of total and common variance. it was concluded that the wais-iv provides strong measurement of general intelligence, and clinical interpretation should be primarily at that level.
@background improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
@background reduced gene expression of intestinal alpha-defensins predicts diarrhea in a cohort of african adults. to determine the response of the small intestinal mucosa to environmental conditions, we studied changes in mucosal architecture and function in a longitudinal cohort study in african adults. over three consecutive years, 238 adults submitted monthly stool samples for parasitologic and bacteriologic analysis and underwent an annual endoscopic jejunal biopsy for mucosal morphometry. absorption and permeability assays were performed on the same day as the enteroscopy. variation in mucosal architecture and function was correlated with environmental factors and stool microbiology. the whole cohort had structural and functional evidence of tropical enteropathy, but structure and function were only weakly correlated. there were marked changes over time, and seasonal variation was observed in villous height (16%), xylose recovery (16%), and permeability (28%). asymptomatic intestinal infections were common. enteropathy was more severe in participants with citrobacter rodentium or hookworm ova in the stool sample taken one month before the investigations were performed.
@method handwritten characters recognition based on nature-inspired computing and neuro-evolution in this paper, we analyze the performance of a classifier ensemble consisting of small-sized neural networks for accurate and fast learning. to this end, three topologies of neural networks are evaluated: the multilayer perceptron with two different configurations in the hidden layer, and the modular neural network. the experiments here carried out illustrate the effectiveness of the ensembles of neural networks in terms of average predictive accuracy and processing time, as compared to the single classifiers.
@result light-induced migration of retinal microglia into the subretinal space. this study determined the minimum cyclic (12l:12d) light intensity which produces retinal damage in albino (sprague-dawley) rats raised from birth to 15 weeks of age under 6 lx (12l:12d). four experimental light intensities were tested, viz. 1345, 270, 130 and 65 lx. control animals remained under 6 lx. after various durations of exposure to one of the intensities tested, the retinas of groups of six rats were evaluated for physiological and morphological evidence of light damage. the indices of damage were: (1) histological and morphometric changes in the retina, and (2) changes in the amplitude and latency of the b-wave of the electroretinogram. light intensities of 1345- or 270 lx severely damage retinas of albino rats raised from birth under 6 lx within 3-7 days of the initiation of light exposure. exposure to 130- or 65 lx produced much less dramatic changes in the responsiveness and morphology of the retina that did not appear to be permanent. based on these results, a reasonable estimate for the threshold cyclic-light intensity which produces damage to retinas of albino rats raised under 6 lx lies between 65- and 130 lx, or slightly more than 1 log unit above the light intensity under which the animals were raised. the effects of an animal's light history on retinal susceptibility to light damage are discussed.
@background critical analysis of e-health readiness assessment frameworks: suitability for application in developing countries background: concept of e-readiness is used in many areas such as e-business, e-commerce, e-government, and e-banking. in terms of healthcare, e-readiness is a rather new concept, and is propounded under the title of e-healthcare. e-health readiness refers to the readiness of communities and healthcare institutions for the expected changes brought by programs related to information and communications technology (lct). the present research is conducted aiming at designing e-health readiness assessment framework (ehraf) in iran. methods: the e-health readiness assessment framework was designed based on reviewing literature on e-readiness assessment models and opinions of ict and health experts. in the next step, delphi method was used to develop and test the designed framework. three questionnaires developed to test and modify the model while determining weights of the indices; afterward they were either sent to experts through email or delivered to them in face. results: the designed framework approved with 4 dimensions, 11 constituents and 58 indices. technical readiness had the highest importance coefficient (0.256099), and the other dimensions were of the next levels of coefficient importance: core readiness (0.25520), social communication readiness (0.244658), and engagement readiness (0.244039). conclusion: the framework presents the movement route and investment priorities in e-health in iran. the proposed framework is a good instrument for measuring the e-readiness in health centers in iran, and for identifying strengths and weaknesses of these centers to access ict and its implementation for more effectiveness and for analyzing digital divide between them, as well.
@background hnrnp-q1 represses nascent axon growth in cortical neurons by inhibiting gap-43 mrna translation during axonal regeneration synthesis of different growth‐associated proteins is increased. as yet there is no clear picture of the specific contribution made by the transcriptional and post‐transcriptional machinery that provides the gene products necessary for process outgrowth. here we focus our study on the transcriptional processes in neurons by using intron‐directed in situ hybridization to the primary transcript of a brain growth protein gap‐43. in most brain regions, levels of primary transcript expression of gap‐43 were highly correlated with levels of its mrna. however, there were notable dissociations: in hippocampal granule cells, high levels of primary transcript were evident yet no gap‐43 mrna was detected. in locus coeruleus the reverse was true; there were high levels of gap‐43 mrna but no detectable primary transcript. a primary transcript antitermination mechanism is proposed to explain the first dissociation, and a post‐transcriptional mrna stabilization mechanism to explain the second. transcriptional activation during nerve regeneration was monitored by assessing primary transcript induction of gap‐43 in mouse facial motor neurons. this induction, as well as its mrna, was restricted to the side of the facial nerve crush. increases were first observed at 24 h with a rapid increase in both measures up to 3 days. to our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence demonstrating transcriptional activation of a brain growth protein in regenerating neurons. the present study points to the gap‐43 transcriptional mechanism as a key determinant of gap‐43 synthesis. along with the recruitment of post‐transcriptional mechanisms, such synthesis occurs in response to both intrinsic developmental programs and extrinsic environmental signals.
@method growth inhibition of escherichia coli by dichloromethane in cells expressing dichloromethane dehalogenase/glutathione s-transferase. abstract the kinetic properties of bacterial and rat liver glutathione s-transferases (gst) active with dichloromethane (dcm) were compared. the theta class glutathione s-transferase (rgstt1-1) from rat liver had an affinity for dihalomethanes lower by three orders of magnitude (kapp > 50 mm) than the bacterial dcm dehalogenase/gst from methylophilus sp. dm11. unlike the bacterial dcm dehalogenase, the rat enzyme was unable to support growth of the dehalogenase minus methylobacterium sp. dm4-2cr mutant with dcm. moreover, the presence of dcm inhibited growth with methanol of the dm4-2cr transconjugant expressing the rat liver gstt1-1. in salmonella typhimurium ta1535, expression of rat and bacterial dcm-active gst from a plasmid in the presence of dcm yielded up to 5.3 times more reversions to histidine prototrophy in the transconjugant expressing the rat enzyme. under the same conditions, however, gst-mediated conversion of dcm to formaldehyde was lower in cell-free extracts of the transconjugant expressing the rat gstt1 than in the corresponding strain expressing the bacterial dcm dehalogenase. this provided new evidence that formaldehyde was not the main toxicant associated with gst-mediated dcm conversion, and indicated that an intermediate in the transformation of dcm by gst, presumably s-chloromethylglutathione, was responsible for the observed effects. the marked differences in substrate affinity of rat and bacterial dcm-active gst, as well as in the toxicity and genotoxicity associated with expression of these enzymes in bacteria, suggest that bacterial dcm dehalogenases/gst have evolved to minimise the toxic effects associated with glutathione-mediated catalysis of dcm conversion.

@background differences in gastric carcinoma microenvironment stratify according to ebv infection intensity: implications for possible immune adjuvant therapy merkel cell carcinoma (mcc) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, a feature suggestive of an infectious origin. we studied mcc samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus t antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase. further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387–base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv or mcpyv). mcv sequences were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) mcc tumors but only 5 of 59 (8%) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16%) control skin tissues. in six of eight mcv-positive mccs, viral dna was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern, suggesting that mcv infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells. thus, mcv may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of mcc.
@method biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass. abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
@background the monoaminergic modulation of sensory-mediated aversive responses in caenorhabditis elegans requires glutamatergic/peptidergic cotransmission neuropeptides play critical roles in synaptic signaling in all nervous systems. unlike classical neurotransmitters, peptidergic neurotransmitters are encoded as preproproteins that are posttranslationally processed to yield bioactive neuropeptides. to identify novel peptidergic neurotransmitters, the caenorhabditis elegans genome was searched for predicted proteins with the structural hallmarks of neuropeptide preproproteins. thirty-two c. elegans neuropeptide-like protein (nlp) genes were identified. the nlp genes define at least 11 families of putative neuropeptides with unique motifs; similar expressed sequence tags were identified in other invertebrate species for all 11 families. six of these families are defined by putative bioactive motifs (fafa, ggxyamide, mrxamide, lqfamide, lxdxamide, and ggaraf); the remaining five families are related to allatostatin, myomodulin, buccalin/drosulfakinin, orcokinin, and apgwamide neuropeptides (mgl/famide, frpamide, msfamide, gfxgf, and yggwamide families, respectively). most c. elegans nlp gene expression is in neurons. the c. elegans nlp genes and similar genes encoding putative neuropeptides in other species are likely to play diverse roles in nervous system function.
@background seeing sound acoustic sensors play an important role in augmenting the traditional biodiversity monitoring activities carried out by ecologists and conservation biologists. with this ability however comes the burden of analysing large volumes of complex acoustic data. given the complexity of acoustic sensor data, fully automated analysis for a wide range of species is still a significant challenge. this research investigates the use of citizen scientists to analyse large volumes of environmental acoustic data in order to identify bird species. specifically, it investigates ways in which the efficiency of a user can be improved through the use of species identification tools and the use of reputation models to predict the accuracy of users with unidentified skill levels. initial experimental results are reported.
@method a topic-based reordering model for statistical machine translation statistical machine translation systems are usually trained on a large amount of bilingual sentence pairs and translate one sentence at a time, ignoring document-level information. in this paper, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level translation. since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size. in this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side. in particular, three new features are designed to explore various kinds of document-level information in above three kinds of caches. evaluation shows the effectiveness of our cache-based approach to document-level translation with the performance improvement of 0.81 in blue score over moses. especially, detailed analysis and discussion are presented to give new insights to document-level translation.
@background evidence of neurodegeneration in obstructive sleep apnea: relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly abstractthe purpose of the present study was to compare exercise status during the follicular (fp) and luteal (lp) phases of the menstrual cycle of a single group of young, sedentary women, where the marked differential in the blood concentrations of 17β-oestradiol ([e2]) and progesterone ([p4]) has the potential to alter the metabolic response to exercise. fourteen females [21.8 (4.0) years, peak oxygen uptake (v̇o2peak) <45 ml·kg −1·min−1] performed both incremental exercise to exhaustion and steady-state submaximal cycle ergometer exercise while measurements were made of several metabolic and hormonal variables. with the incremental exercise test, time to exhaustion, maximal power output and total work done were not different between the two phases, nor were the absolute values for v̇o2peak or the corresponding values for ventilation (v̇e), respiratory frequency (fr) and heart rate (hr). resting, end-exercise and peak (post-exercise) plasma lactate concentrations and the lactate threshold were not different between the two phases either. however, as the workloads increased during the incremental protocol, plasma lactate concentration, carbon dioxide output (v̇co2) and the respiratory exchange ratio (rer) all were lower during lp, while oxygen uptake (v̇o2) was higher. with steady-state submaximal exercise, at workloads corresponding to 25% and 75% of menstrual cycle phase-specific v̇o2peak, v̇o2 and the oxygen pulse (v̇o2/hr) were higher and rer and plasma lactate concentration lower during lp. regardless of phase, [e2] increased with both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise, while [p4] was unchanged. it is concluded that while exercise capacity, as defined by v̇o2peak and the lactate threshold, is unaffected by cycle phase in young, sedentary women, the metabolic responses in the lp during both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise suggest a greater dependence on fat as an energy source.
@result the effect of orthognathic surgery on osteoprotegerin as immunological caliper of bone healing fracture healing is an ordered process that restores the structural integrity of the bone. soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb (srank), its ligand (srankl) and osteoprotegerin (opg) are involved in bone remodelling, thus they may play a role in fracture repair. opg, soluble rank and rankl levels were measured in plasma and in drainage fluid, collected from pre-surgery phase to healing in ten patients of both genders (age range 26–65 years) with proximal humerus fracture needing osteosynthesis. all patients showed fracture healing. no significant modifications in the concentrations of srankl and opg were observed, while srank showed a significant increase in drainage fluid 24 hours post-surgery compared with intra-surgery time. opg levels were higher in plasma and drainage fluid than srank and srankl at each time point. since there are no published data about srank involvement in fracture healing, our study represents the first preliminary indication about a local increase of this marker concentration immediately after surgery.
@background regulation by sirpα of dendritic cell homeostasis in lymphoid tissues. signal regulatory protein (sirp)alpha, also known as shps-1 or sirpa, is a transmembrane protein that binds to the protein tyrosine phosphatases shp-1 and shp-2 through its cytoplasmic region and is predominantly expressed in neurons, dendritic cells and macrophages. cd47, a widely expressed transmembrane protein, is a ligand for sirpalpha, with the two proteins constituting a cell-cell communication system. the interaction of sirpalpha with cd47 is important for the regulation of migration and phagocytosis. recent studies have implicated the cd47-sirpalpha signalling pathway in immune homeostasis and in regulation of neuronal networks. advances in the structural and functional analyses of the cd47-sirpalpha signalling pathway now provide exciting hints of the therapeutic benefits of manipulating this signalling system in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders.
@background dual-energy contrast-enhanced mammography. background experimental evidence suggests that the growth of a tumor beyond a certain size requires angiogenesis, which may also permit metastasis. to investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without).   methods using light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor viii. the microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable.   results both microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. the mean (+/- sd) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. the corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (p = 0.003 and p less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). for each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; p = 0.003). the microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. for each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; p = 0.029).   conclusions the number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both). assessment of tumor angiogenesis may therefore prove valuable in selecting patients with early breast carcinoma for aggressive therapy.
@method quantitative morphological analysis of the sensory epithelium of the starling and pigeon basilar papilla the basilar papilla of the barn owl's (tyto alba) cochlea was found to be 9.5-11.5 mm long. histological examination revealed that the sensory hair cells had a characteristic distribution: the proximal half contained mostly typical short cells; tall hair cells were present only on the distal half along with many short cells. lenticular short cells occupied the proximal tip of the papilla. another unusual feature of the proximal part was a dense fibrous mass in the basilar membrane. this was absent from the distal one-fourth.
@background a virus-encoded cell–cell fusion machine dependent on surrogate adhesins this review analyses recent structural results that provide clues about a possible molecular mechanism for the transmission of a fusogenic signal among the envelope glycoproteins of the herpes simplex virus on receptor binding by glycoprotein gd. this signal triggers the membrane‐fusion machinery of the virus—contained in glycoproteins gb, gh and gl—to induce the merging of viral and cellular membranes, and to allow virus entry into target cells. this activating process parallels that of γ‐retroviruses, in which receptor binding by the amino‐terminal domain of the envelope protein activates the fusogenic potential of the virion in a similar way, despite the different organization of the envelope complexes of these two types of viruses. therefore, the new structural results on the interaction of gd with its receptors might also provide insights into the mechanism of fusogenic signal transmission in γ‐retroviruses. furthermore, the fusion activation parallels with retroviruses, together with the recently reported structural homology of gb with the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein indicate that the complex entry apparatus of herpesviruses appears to be functionally related to that of simpler enveloped viruses.
@method computational methodology for chip-seq analysis recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
@background gender-specific association of polymorphisms in the 5′-utr and 3′-utr of vegf gene with hypertensive patients vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a cytokine involved in angiogenesis and upregulated during adaptive heart hypertrophy. downregulation of vegf seems to trigger the transition from adaptive to dilated cardiac hypertrophy. we investigated for the first time whether 3 clinically relevant polymorphisms in the vegfa gene are associated with altered echocardiographic parameters in hypertensive patients. we determined genotypes for 3 polymorphisms in vegfa promoter in 179 hypertensive patients and 169 healthy controls: g.-2578c>a (rs699947), g.-1154g>a (rs1570360), and g.-634g>c (rs2010963). although the variant genotypes of the g.-634g>c (gc + cc) were associated with reduced left ventricular mass index (p = 0.030), the variant genotypes for the g.-1154g>a (ga + aa) were associated with reduced ejection fraction (p = 0.008). in addition, we found that vegfa haplotypes were associated with altered ejection fraction (p = 0.024). the aag haplotype was associated with reduced ejection fraction (p = 0.006), whereas the agg haplotype was associated with increased ejection fraction (p = 0.010). our results suggest that vegf polymorphisms affect cardiac remodeling. genotypes for vegfa polymorphisms can be useful to help to identify hypertensive patients at greater intrinsic risk for heart failure.
@background the saccharomyces cerevisiae histone chaperone rtt106 mediates the cell cycle recruitment of swi/snf and rsc to the hir-dependent histone genes genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved swi/snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates. the mechanism by which this complex is targeted to specific chromosomal loci remains unknown. we show that swi/snf is required for expression of the yeast histone hta1-htb1 locus because of the role of hir1p and hir2p corepressors in negatively regulating transcription. snf5p, snf2p/swi2p, and swi3p, three components of the yeast swi/snf complex, coimmunoprecipitate with each hir protein, and snf5p is maximally associated with the hta1-htb1 promoter when the hir-based repression system is intact and the swi/snf complex is functional. the data support a role for the hir repressors in the gene-specific targeting of swi/snf.
@background the role of galanin system in modulating depression, anxiety, and addiction-like behaviors after chronic restraint stress stressors can exert a wide variety of responses, ranging from adaptive responses to pathological changes; moreover, recent studies suggest that mild stressors can attenuate the response of a system to major stressful events. we have previously shown that 2‐week exposure to cold, a comparatively mild inescapable stressor, induced a pronounced reduction in ventral tegmental area (vta) dopamine (da) neuron activity, whereas restraint stress increases da neuron activity. however, it is not known if these stressors differentially impact the vta in a region‐specific manner, if they differentially impact behavioral responses, or whether the effects of such different stressors are additive or antagonistic with regard to their impact on da neuron firing. to address these questions, single‐unit extracellular recordings were performed in anesthetized control rats and rats exposed to chronic cold, and tested after delivery of a 2‐h restraint session. chronic cold stress strongly attenuated the number of da neurons firing in the vta, and this effect occurred primarily in the medial and central vta regions that preferentially project to reward‐related ventral striatal regions. chronic cold exposure also prevented the pronounced increase in da neuron population activity without affecting the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine produced by restraint stress. taken together, these data show that a prolonged inescapable mild stressor can induce plastic changes that attenuate the da system response to acute stress.
@result activation of cardiac fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 causes left ventricular hypertrophy. chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with ckd. elevated levels of fgf23 have been linked to greater risks of lvh and mortality in patients with ckd, but whether these risks represent causal effects of fgf23 is unknown. here, we report that elevated fgf23 levels are independently associated with lvh in a large, racially diverse ckd cohort. fgf23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via fgf receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-nfat signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for fgf23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. intramyocardial or intravenous injection of fgf23 in wild-type mice resulted in lvh, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated fgf23 levels and lvh. in an established animal model of ckd, treatment with an fgf-receptor blocker attenuated lvh, although no change in blood pressure was observed. these results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for fgf23 in the pathogenesis of lvh and suggest that chronically elevated fgf23 levels contribute directly to high rates of lvh and mortality in individuals with ckd.
@method effect of sertraline on breathing in depressed patients without moderate-to-severe sleep-related breathing disorders background previous studies have reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) might induce or exacerbate periodic limb movements during sleep (plms). however, most of these studies were retrospective and cross-sectional studies with small sample sizes on a selective ssri, fluoxetine. because different ssris have different pharmacologic profiles, it was not certain if other ssris also might lead to plms.   methods data were taken from an open-label 8-week trial of sertraline in depressive patients with insomnia (n=31). depressed patients were administered sertraline 50mg at 8:00am on the first day, and the dosage was subsequently titrated up to a maximum of 200mg daily during the 8-week trial. all participants were tested by repeated polysomnography (psg) (baseline, first day, 14th day, 28th day, and 56th day). periodic leg movements (plm) were visually counted and the plm index (plmi) was calculated. plms was defined as plmi ⩾5, and significant plms was defined as plmi ⩾15.   results compared with baseline (plmi, 3.6±1.5), all plmi indices increased on the immediate administration of sertraline on the first day (plmi, 5.1±3.9). from the 14th day onward, plmi became stable and significantly higher than baseline and the first day (8.7±3.1 on the 14th day, 8.3±3.7 on the 28th day, and 8.5±3.6 on the 56th day; f[11.81]; p=.003). the clinical responses and psg characteristics continuously improved during the 8-week trial. the plms group (plmi ⩾5) had a higher arousal index (ai) than the non-plms group on the 14th day (9.4±5.5 vs 5.2±3.7; t test, 4.22; p=.03) and the 56th day (8.1±5.5 vs 4.3±3.7; z score, 3.11; p=.04); albeit, there was no significant clinical disturbances in the plms group.   conclusions plms were increased during sertraline treatment, but only a few of the plms reached the significant level. this effect of sertraline on plms might be dosage dependent. although the sertraline-induced plms did not seem to cause significant clinical disturbance, the plms group (plmi ⩾5) had a higher ai than the non-plms group. thus clinicians should pay more attention to plms during ssri antidepressant treatment.
@result usefulness of laboratory data in the management of right iliac fossa pain in adults background studies have shown that c-reactive protein (crp) and total leucocyte count (wbc) in suspected acute appendicitis analysed only on admission gave valuable information to guide the surgeon. the aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of crp and wbc measured repetitively before operation.   methods during a 1-year period 227 patients were studied before emergency appendicectomy. crp and wbc were analysed every 4th h. the upper limits of the reference intervals used were 9.0 x 10(9)/l for wbc and 10 mg/l for crp.   results of the 227 appendicectomized patients, 170 (75%) had acute appendicitis. sixty-six of the patients were tested on two or more occasions every 4th h. forty-six of these patients had appendicitis; repetitive tests showed a continuing rise in crp values but a continuing decrease in wbc. the negative appendicectomy rate among these 66 patients was 30%, which theoretically would have fallen to 19% if patients with normal results had not been subjected to surgery.   conclusions repeated laboratory tests for crp and wbc should be performed in patients with suspected acute appendicitis requested to stay for further observation. if these test results are normal, the surgeon should preferably refrain from operating but consider other differential diagnoses.
@background magno and parvo stimuli affect illusory directional hearing in normal and dyslexic readers dyslexia is a common disorder with largely unknown pathophysiology. we tested ten dyslexic adults and 20 control subjects with trains of binaural clicks which led to illusory sound movements at short click intervals. in controls, the illusion disappeared at intervals exceeding 90-120 ms while in the dyslexics it persisted up to intervals of 250-500 ms. dyslexic adults thus seem to have a deficit in the processing of rapid sound sequences, which is also manifested in significant delays in their conscious auditory percepts. this pathophysiological abnormality seems to persist throughout life.
@background impact of geographic location on vitamin d status and bone mineral density although the importance of solar radiation for vitamin d3 synthesis in the human body is well known, the solar exposure time required to prevent vitamin d deficiency has not been determined in japan. this study attempted to identify the time of solar exposure required for vitamin d3 synthesis in the body by season, time of day, and geographic location (sapporo, tsukuba, and naha) using both numerical simulations and observations. according to the numerical simulation for tsukuba at noon in july under a cloudless sky, 3.5 min of solar exposure are required to produce 5.5 μg vitamin d3 per 600 cm2 skin corresponding to the area of a face and the back of a pair of hands without ingestion from foods. in contrast, it took 76.4 min to produce the same quantity of vitamin d3 at sapporo in december, at noon under a cloudless sky. the necessary exposure time varied considerably with the time of the day. for tsukuba at noon in december, 22.4 min were required, but 106.0 min were required at 09:00 and 271.3 min were required at 15:00 for the same meteorological conditions. naha receives high levels of ultraviolet radiation allowing vitamin d3 synthesis almost throughout the year.
@method physiologic artifacts in resting state oscillations in young children: methodological considerations for noisy data evoked potentials and eegs record punctate electrical activity at electrode sites. to represent the overall potential distribution on the entire scalp it is necessary to interpolate between these sampled values. surface splines are mathematical tools for interpolating functions of two variables. in comparison to the classical methods of interpolation, based on linear combination of the potentials of the 4 nearest electrodes, spline methods are smoother, give more precisely located extrema and converge faster toward the 'true' potential surface when the number of recording electrodes is increased. these advantages are at the expense of lengthier computation time.
@background rap1 and canoe/afadin are essential for establishment of apical–basal polarity in the drosophila embryo regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction is essential for the normal physiology of metazoans and is important in many diseases. integrin adhesion receptors can rapidly increase their affinity (integrin activation) in response to intracellular signaling events in a process termed inside-out signaling. the transmembrane domains of integrins and their interactions with the membrane are important in inside-out signaling. moreover, integrin activation is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. here, we review recent progress in understanding how the membrane environment can, in cooperation with integrin-binding proteins, regulate integrin activation.
@result genetics of sleep disorders. neurons containing the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus and send axons to numerous regions throughout the central nervous system, including the major nuclei implicated in sleep regulation. here, we report that, by behavioral and electroencephalographic criteria, orexin knockout mice exhibit a phenotype strikingly similar to human narcolepsy patients, as well as canarc-1 mutant dogs, the only known monogenic model of narcolepsy. moreover, modafinil, an anti-narcoleptic drug with ill-defined mechanisms of action, activates orexin-containing neurons. we propose that orexin regulates sleep/wakefulness states, and that orexin knockout mice are a model of human narcolepsy, a disorder characterized primarily by rapid eye movement (rem) sleep dysregulation.
@background isodicentric yq mosaicism presenting as infertility and maturation arrest without altered sry and azf regions massive palindromes in the human y chromosome harbor mirror-image gene pairs essential for spermatogenesis. during evolution, these gene pairs have been maintained by intrapalindrome, arm-to-arm recombination. the mechanism of intrapalindrome recombination and risk of harmful effects are unknown. we report 51 patients with isodicentric y (idicy) chromosomes formed by homologous crossing over between opposing arms of palindromes on sister chromatids. these ectopic recombination events occur at nearly all y-linked palindromes. based on our findings, we propose that intrapalindrome sequence identity is maintained via noncrossover pathways of homologous recombination. dna double-strand breaks that initiate these pathways can be alternatively resolved by crossing over between sister chromatids to form idicy chromosomes, with clinical consequences ranging from spermatogenic failure to sex reversal and turner syndrome. our observations imply that crossover and noncrossover pathways are active in nearly all y-linked palindromes, exposing an achilles' heel in the mechanism that preserves palindrome-borne genes.
@method impact of the cftr-potentiator ivacaftor on airway microbiota in cystic fibrosis patients carrying a g551d mutation summary the common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (fwer). this approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. a different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. it calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. this error rate is equivalent to the fwer when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the fwer is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. a simple sequential bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. the use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.
@result kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus induces the atm and h2ax dna damage response early during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells, which play roles in latency establishment abstract the dna damage response (ddr) of host cells is utilized by a number of viruses to establish and propagate their genomes in the infected cells. we examined the expression of the ddr genes during kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the genes were mostly downregulated, except h2ax, which was upregulated during infection. h2ax is important for gammaherpesvirus infectivity, and its phosphorylation at serine 139 is crucial for maintenance of latency during mouse gamma-herpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) infection. we now also observed phosphorylation of h2ax at serine 139 during kshv infection. h2ax is a histone h2a isoform shown to interact with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) encoded by kshv. here, we show that lana directly interacted with h2ax through domains at both its n and c termini. the phosphorylated form of h2ax (γh2ax) was shown to colocalize with lana. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays showed that a reduction in h2ax levels resulted in reduced binding of lana with kshv terminal repeats (trs). binding preferences of h2ax and γh2ax along the kshv episome were examined by whole-episome chip analysis. we showed that γh2ax had a higher relative binding activity along the tr regions than that of the long unique region (lur), which highlighted the importance of h2ax phosphorylation during kshv infection. furthermore, knockdown of h2ax resulted in decreased kshv episome copy number. notably, the c terminus of lana contributed to phosphorylation of h2ax. however, phosphorylation was not dependent on the ability of lana to drive kshv-infected cells into s-phase. thus, h2ax contributes to association of lana with the trs, and phosphorylation of h2ax is likely important for its increased density at the trs.
@background an attempt towards simultaneous biobased solvent based extraction of proteins and enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic materials from distiller's grains and solubles. ddgs and wet distillers' grains are the major co-products of the dry grind ethanol facilities. as they are mainly used as animal feed, a typical compositional analysis of the ddgs and wet distillers' grains mainly focuses on defining the feedstock's nutritional characteristics. with an increasing demand for fuel ethanol, the ddgs and wet distillers' grains are viewed as a potential bridge feedstock for ethanol production from other cellulosic biomass. the introduction of ddgs or wet distillers' grains as an additional feed to the existing dry grind plants for increased ethanol yield requires a different approach to the compositional analysis of the material. rather than focusing on its nutritional value, this new approach aims at determining more detailed chemical composition, especially on polymeric sugars such as cellulose, starch and xylan, which release fermentable sugars upon enzymatic hydrolysis. in this paper we present a detailed and complete compositional analysis procedure suggested for ddgs and wet distillers' grains, as well as the resulting compositions completed by three different research groups. polymeric sugars, crude protein, crude oil and ash contents of ddgs and wet distillers' grains were accurately and reproducibly determined by the compositional analysis procedure described in this paper.
@method age and education-matched cut-off scores for the revised german/swiss-german version of ecas abstract this study presents the edinburgh cognitive and behavioural als screen (ecas), developed for als patients with physical disability for use by health care professionals. the screen is designed to detect the specific profile of cognition and behaviour changes in als and to differentiate it from other disorders. forty-eight als patients (none with evident dementia), 40 healthy controls and 20 carers were recruited. the ecas, a 15–20-min screen, includes an als-specific score (executive functions and social cognition; fluency; language); an als non-specific score (memory; visuospatial functions); and a carer behaviour screen of five domains characteristic of frontotemporal dementia (ftd). data from healthy controls produced abnormality cut-offs of 77/100 als-specific score; 24/36 als non-specific score; 105/136 ecas total. twenty-nine percent of patients showed abnormal als-specific scores, and 6% also showed abnormal als non-specific scores. the most prevalent deficit occurred in language functions (35%) followed by executive functions and fluency (23% each). forty percent of carers reported behaviour change in at least one domain, while 15% met criteria for possible ftd. in conclusion, the ecas is an effective within-clinic assessment for als that determines the presence, severity and type of cognitive and/or behavioural changes, an essential first step to managing these symptoms.
@background kin effects on energy allocation in group-living ground squirrels. since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
@method measurement of eyeball rotational movements in the dark environment algorithms developed by the author for recognizing persons by their iris patterns have now been tested in many field and laboratory trials, producing no false matches in several million comparison tests. the recognition principle is the failure of a test of statistical independence on iris phase structure encoded by multi-scale quadrature wavelets. the combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 b/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. the high confidence levels are important because they allow very large databases to be searched exhaustively (one-to-many "identification mode") without making false matches, despite so many chances. biometrics that lack this property can only survive one-to-one ("verification") or few comparisons. the paper explains the iris recognition algorithms and presents results of 9.1 million comparisons among eye images from trials in britain, the usa, japan, and korea.
@result a simulation study into the performance of "optimal" diagnostic thresholds in the population:"large" effect sizes are not enough. when investigating the effects of potential prognostic or risk factors that have been measured on a quantitative scale, values of these factors are often categorized into two groups. sometimes an 'optimal' cutpoint is chosen that gives the best separation in terms of a two-sample test statistic. it is well known that this approach leads to a serious inflation of the type i error and to an overestimation of the effect of the prognostic or risk factor in absolute terms. in this paper, we illustrate that the resulting confidence intervals are similarly affected. we show that the application of a shrinkage procedure to correct for bias, together with bootstrap resampling for estimating the variance, yields confidence intervals for the effect of a potential prognostic or risk factor with the desired coverage.
@background a taste for novelty in invading house sparrows, passer domesticus biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment. they are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. in a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these im- migrations. the fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. in turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. there are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) in agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous "tax" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) the global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment con- stitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem- wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a "guilty until proven innocent" approach would be a productive first step. failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.
@background knot resolution algorithm and its performance evaluation the author describes a series of deadlock detection techniques based on centralized, hierarchical, and distributed control organizations. the point of view is that of practical implications. an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of deadlock detection algorithms is presented, their merits and drawbacks are discussed, and their performances (delays as well as message complexity) are compared. related issues such as correctness of the algorithms, performance of the algorithms, and deadlock resolution, which require further research are examined.<<etx>>
@background thermal degradation and fire behaviour of thermal insulation materials based on food crop by-products abstract dynamic tg analysis under nitrogen was used to investigate the thermal decomposition processes of 10 types of natural fibers commonly used in the polymer composite industry. these fibers included wood, bamboo, agricultural residue, and bast fibers. various degradation models including the kissinger, friedman, flynn–wall–ozawa, and modified coats–redfern methods were used to determine the apparent activation energy of these fibers. for most natural fibers approximately 60% of the thermal decomposition occurred within a temperature range between 215 and 310 °c. the result also showed that an apparent activation energy of 160–170 kj/mol was obtained for most of the selected fibers throughout the polymer processing temperature range. these activation energy values allow developing a simplified approach to understand the thermal decomposition behavior of natural fibers as a function of polymer composite processing.
@background neuroendocrine-immune interaction: evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that maintain allostasis in an ever-changing environment. parent-offspring conflicts lead the offspring to evolve reliable signals of individual quality, including parasite burden, which may allow parents to adaptively modulate investment in the progeny. sex-related variation in offspring reproductive value, however, may entail differential investment in sons and daughters. here, we experimentally manipulated offspring condition in the barn swallow (hirundo rustica) by subjecting nestlings to an immune challenge (injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, lps) that simulates a bacterial infection, and assessed the effects on growth, feather quality, expression of morphological (gape coloration) and behavioral (posture) begging displays involved in parent-offspring communication, as well as on food allocation by parents. compared to sham-injected controls, lps-treated chicks suffered a depression of body mass and a reduction of palate color saturation. in addition, lps treatment resulted in lower feather quality, with an increase in the occurrence of fault bars on wing feathers. the color of beak flanges, feather growth and the intensity of postural begging were affected by lps treatment only in females, suggesting that chicks of either sex are differently susceptible to the immune challenge. however, irrespective of the effects of lps, parents equally allocated food among control and challenged offspring both under normal food provisioning and after a short period of food deprivation of the chicks. these results indicate that bacterial infection and the associated immune response entail different costs to offspring of either sex, but a decrease in nestling conditions does not affect parental care allocation, possibly because the barn swallow adopts a brood-survival strategy. finally, we showed that physiological stress induced by pathogens impairs plumage quality, a previously neglected major negative impact of bacterial infection which could severely affect fitness, particularly among long-distance migratory birds.
@background sculpting 3d spatial selectivity with pairs of 2d pulses: a comparison of methods. the understanding and control of spin dynamics play a fundamental role in modern nmr imaging, for devising new ways to monitor an object's density as well as for enabling the tailored excitation of spins in space. it has recently been shown that by relying on spatiotemporal encoding (spen), new forms of single-scan multidimensional nmr spectroscopy and imaging become feasible. the present study extends those imaging developments, by introducing a new class of multidimensional excitation pulses that relies on spen concepts. we focus in particular on a family of "hybrid" 2d radiofrequency (rf) pulses that operate in both direct and reciprocal excitation space, and which can spatially sculpt the spin magnetization in manners that are beyond the reach of sequential 1d pulse shaping. these spen-based 2d pulses are compatible with a majority of single- and multi-scan imaging techniques. like the corresponding spen-based hybrid 2d acquisitions, these pulses can benefit from a high robustness against field inhomogeneities and/or offset effects that affect their k-space-based counterparts. these properties are analyzed, and illustrated with numerical simulations and model experiments.
@background analysis of the modulated acoustic radiation-force profile for a dual-beam confocal geometry. we describe theoretical principles of an imaging modality that uses the acoustic response of an object to a highly localized dynamic radiation force of an ultrasound field. in this method, named ultrasound-stimulated vibro-acoustography (usva), ultrasound is used to exert a low-frequency (in khz range) force on the object. in response, a portion of the object vibrates sinusoidally in a pattern determined by its viscoelastic properties. the acoustic emission field resulting from object vibration is detected and used to form an image that represents both the ultrasonic and low-frequency (khz range) mechanical characteristics of the object. we report the relation between the emitted acoustic field and the incident ultrasonic pressure field in terms of object parameters. also, we present the point-spread function of the imaging system. the experimental images in this report have a resolution of about 700 microm, high contrast, and high signal-to-noise ratio. usva is sensitive enough to detect object motions on the order of nanometers. possible applications include medical imaging and material evaluation.
@background towards optimal transport with global invariances state-of-the-art methods for learning cross-lingual word embeddings have relied on bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. recent studies showed that the need for parallel data supervision can be alleviated with character-level information. while these methods showed encouraging results, they are not on par with their supervised counterparts and are limited to pairs of languages sharing a common alphabet. in this work, we show that we can build a bilingual dictionary between two languages without using any parallel corpora, by aligning monolingual word embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs. our experiments demonstrate that our method works very well also for distant language pairs, like english-russian or english-chinese. we finally describe experiments on the english-esperanto low-resource language pair, on which there only exists a limited amount of parallel data, to show the potential impact of our method in fully unsupervised machine translation. our code, embeddings and dictionaries are publicly available.
@background social cognitive neuroscience and humanoid robotics this paper presents a 50-d.o.f. humanoid robot, computational brain (cb). cb is a humanoid robot created for exploring the underlying processing of the human brain while dealing with the real world. we place our investigations within real—world contexts, as humans do. in so doing, we focus on utilizing a system that is closer to humans—in sensing, kinematics configuration and performance. we present the real-time network-based architecture for the control of all 50 d.o.f. the controller provides full position/velocity/force sensing and control at 1 khz, allowing us the flexibility in deriving various forms of control. a dynamic simulator is also presented; the simulator acts as a realistic testbed for our controllers and acts as a common interface to our humanoid robots. a contact model developed to allow better validation of our controllers prior to final testing on the physical robot is also presented. three aspects of the system are highlighted in this paper: (i) physical power for walking, (ii) full-body compliant control—physical interactions and (iii) perception and control—visual ocular-motor responses.
@background age-related changes in motor control during unimanual movements we investigate age- and expertise-related individual differences in component processes of rhythmic timing. to this end we apply analysis of covariance structure and symbolic dynamics to time series obtained from performances of two bimanual rhythm tasks at different tempos. results show similar effects for peripheral motor implementation and timekeeper execution in young and older amateur pianists. older participants show specific problems with temporal sequencing processes (specification of different target intervals). expert pianists show lower variability in both motor implementation and timekeeper execution and they accommodate to the sequencing demands of different tempos by selectively relying on integrated or parallel timing. we argue that the observed timing control characteristics reflect individuals' adaptations to internal processing limitations and performance constraints.
@method strong artificial selection in domestic mammals did not result in an increased recombination rate. analysis of diverse eukaryotes has revealed that recombination events cluster in discrete genomic locations known as hotspots. in humans, a zinc-finger protein, prdm9, is believed to initiate recombination in >40% of hotspots by binding to a specific dna sequence motif. however, the prdm9 coding sequence is disrupted in the dog genome assembly, raising questions regarding the nature and control of recombination in dogs. by analyzing the sequences of prdm9 orthologs in a number of dog breeds and several carnivores, we show here that this gene was inactivated early in canid evolution. we next use patterns of linkage disequilibrium using more than 170,000 snp markers typed in almost 500 dogs to estimate the recombination rates in the dog genome using a coalescent-based approach. broad-scale recombination rates show good correspondence with an existing linkage-based map. significant variation in recombination rate is observed on the fine scale, and we are able to detect over 4000 recombination hotspots with high confidence. in contrast to human hotspots, 40% of canine hotspots are characterized by a distinct peak in gc content. a comparative genomic analysis indicates that these peaks are present also as weaker peaks in the panda, suggesting that the hotspots have been continually reinforced by accelerated and strongly gc biased nucleotide substitutions, consistent with the long-term action of biased gene conversion on the dog lineage. these results are consistent with the loss of prdm9 in canids, resulting in a greater evolutionary stability of recombination hotspots. the genetic determinants of recombination hotspots in the dog genome may thus reflect a fundamental process of relevance to diverse animal species.
@method two domains of p 80 katanin regulate microtubule severing and spindle pole targeting by p 60 katanin microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis. the previous discovery of a cyclin b/cdc2-activated microtubule-severing activity in m-phase xenopus egg extracts suggested that a microtubule-severing protein might play an important role in cell cycle-dependent changes in microtubule dynamics and organization. however, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, ef1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin b/cdc2. here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of m-phase severing activity in xenopus eggs. this result suggests that katanin is responsible for changes in microtubules occurring at mitosis. immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that katanin is concentrated at a microtubule-dependent structure at mitotic spindle poles in xenopus a6 cells and in human fibroblasts, suggesting a specific role in microtubule disassembly at spindle poles. surprisingly, katanin was also found in adult mouse brain, indicating that katanin may have other functions distinct from its mitotic role.
@background weight loss maintenance in african american women: a systematic review of the behavioral lifestyle intervention literature context behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common.   objective to compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group.   design, setting, and participants two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% african american, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred august 2003-july 2004 and randomization, february-december 2004. data collection was completed in june 2007.   interventions after the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. main outcome changes in weight from randomization.   results mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. during the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. after randomization, weight regain occurred. participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; p = .001). at 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% ci, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; p = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% ci, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; p = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% ci, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; p = .04). at 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% ci -2.1 to -0.3; p = .008). effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight.   conclusions the majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00054925.
@method surveillance of the colorectal cancer disparities among demographic subgroups: a spatial analysis both statistical ecology and environmental statistics have numerous challenges and opportunities in the waiting for the twenty-first century, calling for increasing numbers of nontraditional statistical approaches. both theoretical and applied ecology are using advancing data analytical and interpretational software and hardware to satisfy public policy and discovery research, variously incorporating geospatial information, site-specific data and remote sensing imagery. we discuss a declared need for geoinformatic surveillance for spatial critical area detection. we explore, for ecological and environmental use, an innovation of the circle-based spatial scan statistic popular in the health sciences.
@method batch-normalized maxout network in network we consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. we define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. we empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. we use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: mnist, cifar-10, cifar-100, and svhn.
@background hmgb1/2 can target dna for illegitimate cleavage by the rag1/2 complex v(d)j recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. however, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant v(d)j recombination. translocations involving lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving sil/scl, are cited examples of illegitimate v(d)j recombination. previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (crsss) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support v(d)j recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide v(d)j recombination signals. to understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these crsss by the rag1/2 proteins that initiate v(d)j recombination. we find that the rag proteins comparably bind all crsss tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus rss. we show that four crsss that support levels of v(d)j recombination above background levels in cell culture (lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and sil) are also cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus rss. cleavage of lmo2 and ttg-1 by the rag proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated pcr. in contrast, hox11 and scl are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these crsss in cell culture.
@method systematically differentiating functions for alternatively spliced isoforms through integrating rna-seq data in pattern classification it is usually assumed that a training set of labeled patterns is available. multiple-instance learning (mil) generalizes this problem setting by making weaker assumptions about the labeling information. while each pattern is still believed to possess a true label, training labels are associated with sets or bags of patterns rather than individual patterns. more formally, given is a set of patterns x1, ...,xn grouped into bags x1, ..., xm, with xj = {xi : i ∈ ij} and ij ⊆ {1, ..., n}. with each bag xj is associated a label yj ∈ {−1, 1}. these labels are interpreted in the following way: if a bag has a negative label yj = −1, all patterns in that bag inherit the negative label. if on the other hand, yj = 1, then at least one pattern xi ∈ xj is a positive example of the underlying concept. the mil scenario has many interesting applications: one prominent application is the classification of molecules in the context of drug design (dietterich, lathrop, & lozanoperez 1997). here, each molecule is represented by a bag of possible conformations. another application is in image retrieval where images can be viewed as bags of local image patches (maron & ratan 1998) or image regions. algorithms for the mil problem were first presented in (dietterich, lathrop, & lozano-perez 1997; auer 1997; long & tan 1996). these methods (and analytical results) are based on hypothesis classes consisting of axisaligned rectangles. similarly, methods developed subsequently (e.g., (maron & lozano-perez 1998; zhang & goldman 2002)) have focused on specially tailored machine learning algorithms that do not compare favorably in the limiting case of bags of size 1 (the standard classification setting). a notable exception is (ramon & raedt 2000).
@background spectral normalization between landsat-8/oli, landsat- 7/etm+ and cbers-4/mux bands through linear regression and spectral unmixing satellite image time series are becoming increasingly available and will continue to do so in the coming years thanks to the launch of space missions which aim at providing a coverage of the earth every few days with high spatial resolution. in the case of optical imagery, it will be possible to produce land use and cover change maps with detailed nomenclatures. however, due to meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, these time series will become irregular in terms of temporal sampling, and one will need to compare time series with different lengths. in this paper, we present an approach to image time series analysis which is able to deal with irregularly sampled series and which also allows the comparison of pairs of time series where each element of the pair has a different number of samples. we present the dynamic time warping from a theoretical point of view and illustrate its capabilities with two applications to real-time series.
@background sars: responding to an unknown virus background severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is continuing to spread around the world. all hospitals must be prepared to care for patients with sars. thus, it is important to understand the transmission of this disease in hospitals and to evaluate methods for its containment in health care institutions. we describe how we cared for the first 2 patients with sars admitted to our 419-bed community hospital in richmond hill, ont., and the response to a sars outbreak within our institution.   methods we collected clinical and epidemiological data about patients and health care workers at our institution who during a 13-day period had a potential unprotected exposure to 2 patients whose signs and symptoms were subsequently identified as meeting the case definition for probable sars. the index case at our hospital was a patient who was transferred to our intensive care unit (icu) from a referral hospital on mar. 16, 2003, where he had been in close proximity to the son of the individual with the first reported case of sars in toronto. after 13 days in the icu, a diagnosis of probable sars was reached for our index case. immediately upon diagnosis of our index case, respiratory isolation and barrier precautions were instituted throughout our hospital and maintained for a period of 10 days, which is the estimated maximum incubation period reported for this disease. aggressive surveillance measures among hospital staff, patients and visitors were also maintained during this time.   results during the surveillance period, 15 individuals (10 hospital staff, 3 patients and 2 visitors) were identified as meeting the case definition for probable or suspected sars, in addition to our index case. all but 1 individual had had direct contact with a symptomatic patient with sars during the period of unprotected exposure. no additional cases were identified after infection control precautions had been implemented for 8 days. no cases of secondary transmission were identified in the 21 days following the implementation of these precautions at our institution.   interpretation sars can easily be spread by direct personal contact in the hospital setting. we found that the implementation of aggressive infection control measures is effective in preventing further transmission of this disease.
@method diversenet: when one right answer is not enough many practical perception systems exist within larger processes that include interactions with users or additional components capable of evaluating the quality of predicted solutions. in these contexts, it is beneficial to provide these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a single prediction. in this work, we pose the task of producing multiple outputs as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to an oracle. our method is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and loss function, and parameter-free. our approach achieves lower oracle error compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures. we also show qualitatively that the diverse solutions produced often provide interpretable representations of task ambiguity.
@result taurine release by astrocytes modulates osmosensitive glycine receptor tone and excitability in the adult supraoptic nucleus whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from isolated rat supraoptic nucleus magnocellular neurosecretory cells (mncs). under current clamping, hyperosmolality produced by the addition of 10-30 mm mannitol depolarized each of 25 cells tested. in contrast, reducing fluid osmolality from 295 to 265 mosmol/kgh2o had the reverse effect, hyperpolarizing 18 of 21 mncs. voltage-clamp recordings in 43 cells revealed that the effects of hypo- and hyperosmolality, respectively, were caused by decreases and increases in a nonselective cation conductance reversing near -41 mv. current-voltage analysis in na(+)-free solution revealed that the reversal potentials of currents elicited by increases and decreases in osmolality both shifted to a value near -90 mv, suggesting that a single ionic conductance is modulated by these stimuli. the relation between cationic conductance and osmolality was specific, sensitive (+2.14%.mosmol-1.kgh2o-1), and well-fit by linear regression (r = 0.96; n = 22 cells) between 275 and 325 mosmol/kgh2o. these results indicate that mncs express a depolarizing current that is active under steady-state conditions and that the up- or downregulation of this current contributes to the excitation or inhibition of these cells upon acute exposure to hypo- or hyperosmolar conditions.
@background cadmium induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin and increases expression of c-myc and abcb1a in kidney proximal tubule cells cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
@method organic acid profile of isovaleric acidemia: a comprehensive metabolomics approach isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
@result differential responsiveness to 17β-estradiol of mesenchymal stem cells from postmenopausal women between osteoporosis and osteoarthritis the aim of this study was to compare the osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) from bone marrow between postmenopausal women with osteoarthritis (oa) and osteoporosis (op). mscs of the proximal femur from oa and op donors were cultured under control and different experimental mediums. after verifying the availability of primary cells, their osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin were compared between two groups. similar patterns of cell growth were shown in both oa and op groups. however, after the sixth passage, the viability of undifferentiated cells decreased more in op than in oa donors. under the same osteogenic supplements condition, the mrna expression of osteogenesis‐specific genes, osteocalcin (oc) and alkaline phosphatase (alp) were higher in oa group. comparison of bone matrix mineralization was parallel to that of mrna expression. the level of bone‐specific alp (bap) was higher in cells from donors with oa, whereas osteoprotegerin (opg) was higher in op group. this difference in bap expression proved to be insignificant after the administration of leptin. although leptin upregulated the expression of opg, a significant difference still existed between oa and op. in conclusion, differential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mscs were noted between postmenopausal women with oa and op. differential biological behavior of mscs seems to be partly related to the different distribution of bone mass between oa and op populations. © 2009 orthopaedic research society. published by wiley periodicals, inc. j orthop res 27: 1067–1073, 2009
@background urinary diversion in children and adolescents with neurogenic bladder: the mainz experience a study of the long-term results of ileal conduit urinary diversion for non-malignant disease in 90 children has shown that there were 75 survivors after 10 to 16 years. stomal stenosis and ureteroileal or other intrinsic obstructions requiring ileal loop revisions occurred frequently and as late as 13 years postoperatively. of 144 renal units 76 per cent improved or remained stable and 69.3 per cent of normal kidneys remained normal after more than a decade of urinary diversion. in order to obtain these results close lifetime followup and aggressive loop revisions have been required. urine cultures were consistently negative in 70.5 per cent of all patients. good results were obtained in terms of preservation of renal function in all categories. creatinine clearance remained in the normal range after 10 years if the excretory urogram remained normal. ileal conduit urinary diversion remains a major surgical undertaking but it also remains the standard of urinary diversion against which all other methods must be judged. the results in terms of renal preservation are impressive but so too are the significant number of long-term complications. any other method of diversion (such as the sigmoid conduit) that can improve upon these results will be welcomed. all children with ileal conduit urinary diversion for reasons other than a neurogenic bladder must be considered candidates for urinary reconstruction.
@result laparoscopic extended liver resection: are postoperative outcomes different? background left hepatic trisectionectomy is the most extended hepatic resection. to date, few data are available on longterm outcomes after this operation.   study design between june 1998 and july 2004, a total of 52 patients underwent left trisectionectomy for primary or secondary hepatobiliary tumors at our institution. data were analyzed with regard to patient characteristics, intraoperative details, pathologic findings, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and outcomes as determined by survival.   results left trisectionectomy was combined with caudate lobectomy and hilar lymph node dissection in 29 and 35 patients, respectively. in addition, 43 procedures were performed in 31 patients: resection of hilar bifurcation (n = 15), bile-duct revision (n = 5), wedge resection of segment vi/vii (n = 10), gastrectomy (n = 1), and resection or reconstruction of hepatic vessels or the inferior vena cava (n = 12). operative morbidity and mortality were 50% and 11.9%, respectively. by multivariate analysis, additional operative procedures constituted the only positive predictor of postoperative morbidity. one-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 65%, 52%, and 33%, respectively. after r0 resection (n = 37), 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 78%, 68%, and 44% compared with 38%, 15%, and 7% after r1 resection (p = 0.0004). survival corresponding to the four most frequent tumor types (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal metastases) was comparable with survival data reported in the literature after less-extensive resections.   conclusions left trisectionectomy provides acceptable survival rates in both locally advanced primary hepatobiliary malignancies and large metastatic liver tumors. despite major progress in surgical technique and perioperative management, left trisectionectomy is still associated with higher operative mortality and morbidity than less-extensive resections. because selection criteria for this type of procedure are not clearly defined, particular attention should be focused on the oncologic benefits when considering this operation.
@background cytotoxic germacranolide sesquiterpenes from the bark of magnolia kobus ten compounds were isolated from the etoac soluble part of the meoh extract of saussureae radix, with their effects on melanin production also evaluated in b-16 mouse melanoma cell lines stimulated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (ibmx), an elevator of cellular camp. the compounds were identified as aplotaxene (1), 1β-hydroxy arbusculin a (2), costunolide (3), dehydrocostuslactone (4), 11β,13-dihydrocostunolide (5), reynosin (6), heptadec-(9z)-enoic acid (7), β-sitosterol (8), linoleic acid methyl ester (9) and betulinic acid methyl ester (10). compounds 2, 9 and 10 were identified from saussureae radix for the first time. furthermore, compounds 2, 3 and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on the ibmx-induced melanogenesis, in dose-dependent manners, with ic50 values of 11, 3 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. as a positive control, arbutin exhibited an ic50 value of 29 μg/ml.
@result global genome response of escherichia coli o157∶h7 sakai during dynamic changes in growth kinetics induced by an abrupt temperature downshift an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was undertaken to determine the physiological response of escherichia coli o157:h7 sakai to steady-state conditions relevant to low temperature and water activity conditions experienced during meat carcass chilling in cold air. the response of e. coli during exponential growth at 25 °c aw 0.985, 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967 was compared with that of a reference culture (35 °c aw 0.993). gene and protein expression profiles of e. coli were more strongly affected by low water activity (aw 0.967) than by low temperature (14 °c). predefined group enrichment analysis revealed that a universal response of e. coli to all test conditions included activation of the master stress response regulator rpos and the rcs phosphorelay system involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid, as well as down-regulation of elements involved in chemotaxis and motility. however, colanic acid-deficient mutants were shown to achieve comparable growth rates to their wild-type parents under all conditions, indicating that colanic acid is not required for growth. in contrast to the transcriptomic data, the proteomic data revealed that several processes involved in protein synthesis were down-regulated in overall expression at 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967. this result suggests that during growth under these conditions, e. coli, although able to transcribe the required mrna, may lack the cellular resources required for translation. elucidating the global adaptive response of e. coli o157:h7 during exposure to chilling and water activity stress has provided a baseline of knowledge of the physiology of this pathogen.
@background a rare case of systemic lupus erythematosus with chylous ascites and chylothorax we describe a patient with a history of discoid lupus erythematosus who presented with chylous ascites and chylothorax. analysis of peritoneal and pleural fluid showed a high level of triglycerides and the presence of antinuclear antibody and anti-dsdna antibody. further study revealed other diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus and serologic markers of disease activity. the patient was successfully treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and high doses of prednisone, followed by immunosuppressants.
@method decision-makers’ preferences for approving new medicines in wales: a discrete-choice experiment with assessment of external validity the decisions made by the national institute for clinical excellence (nice) give rise to two questions: how is cost-effectiveness evidence used to make judgements about the 'value for money' of health technologies? and how are factors other than cost-effectiveness taken into account? the aim of this paper is to explore nice's cost-effectiveness threshold(s) and the tradeoffs between cost effectiveness and other factors apparent in its decisions. binary choice analysis is used to reveal the preferences of nice and to consider the consistency of its decisions. for each decision to accept or reject a technology, explanatory variables include: the cost per life year or per qaly gained; uncertainty regarding cost effectiveness; the net cost to the nhs; the burden of disease; the availability (or not) of alternative treatments; and specific factors indicated by nice. results support the broad notion of a threshold, where the probability of rejection increases as the cost per qaly increases. cost effectiveness, together with uncertainty and the burden of disease, explain nice decisions better than cost effectiveness alone. the results suggest a threshold somewhat higher than nices stated 'range of acceptable cost effectiveness' of pound 20,000-30,000 british pounds per qaly--although the exact meaning of a 'range' in this context remains unclear.
@background long-term effects of a personality-targeted intervention to reduce alcohol use in adolescents. context selective interventions targeting personality risk are showing promise in the prevention of problematic drinking behavior, but their effect on illicit drug use has yet to be evaluated.   objective to investigate the efficacy of targeted coping skills interventions on illicit drug use in adolescents with personality risk factors for substance misuse.   design randomized controlled trial.   setting secondary schools in london, united kingdom.   participants a total of 5302 students were screened to identify 2028 students aged 13 to 16 years with elevated scores on self-report measures of hopelessness, anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. seven hundred thirty-two students provided parental consent to participate in this trial.   intervention participants were randomly assigned to a control no-intervention condition or a 2-session group coping skills intervention targeting 1 of 4 personality profiles.   main outcome measures the trial was designed and powered to primarily evaluate the effect of the intervention on the onset, prevalence, and frequency of illicit drug use over a 2-year period.   results intent-to-treat repeated-measures analyses on continuous measures of drug use revealed time x intervention effects on the number of drugs used (p < .01) and drug use frequency (p < .05), whereby the control group showed significant growth in the number of drugs used as well as more frequent drug use over the 2-year period relative to the intervention group. survival analysis using logistic regression revealed that the intervention was associated with reduced odds of taking up the use of marijuana (beta = -0.3; robust se = 0.2; p = .09; odds ratio = 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0), cocaine (beta = -1.4; robust se = 0.4; p < .001; odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.5), and other drugs (beta = -0.7; robust se = 0.3; p = .03; odds ratio = 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9) over the 24-month period.   conclusion this study extends the evidence that brief, personality-targeted interventions can prevent the onset and escalation of substance misuse in high-risk adolescents.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00344474.
@result neurophysiological correlates of depressive symptoms in young adults: a quantitative eeg study in previous quantitative eeg studies of depression, mostly patients with a lifetime history of depressive disorders were reported. this study examined quantitative eeg parameters obtained in the early stages of depression in comparison with age-matched healthy controls. eeg was recorded using two different montages in eyes closed and eyes open resting states. a significant increase in spectrum power in theta (4–7.5 hz), alpha (7.5–14 hz), and beta (14–20 hz) frequency bands was found in depressed patients at parietal and occipital sites, both in eyes closed and eyes open conditions. these results suggest that an increase in slow (theta and alpha) activity in the eeg pattern may reflect a decreased cortical activation in these brain regions. enhancement of beta power may correlate with anxiety symptoms that most likely play an important role on the onset of depressive disorder.
@background role of nitric oxide mechanisms in control of pyloric motility and transpyloric flow of liquids in conscious dogs antropyloroduodenal motility was recorded in seven anesthetized dogs to assess the role of nitric oxide and l-arginine metabolites in nonadrenergic noncholinergic (nanc) mediation of pyloric relaxation. pyloric activity induced by duodenal field stimulation was inhibited by antral field stimulation and electrical vagal stimulation. intra-arterial ng-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-name) reduced the inhibition from antral or vagal stimulation (p less than 0.05). intravenous infusion of l-name also blocked the inhibitory effect of vagal and antral stimulation but left the tetrodotoxin-insensitive action of intra-arterial vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) and sodium nitroprusside unchanged. l-arginine reversed the effect of l-name whereas d-arginine did not. l-name enhanced pyloric contractions to intra-arterial acetylcholine. the nanc inhibition of the substance p-stimulated pyloric response in vitro was blocked by l-name and reversed by addition of l-arginine. sodium nitroprusside was effective as a relaxant in vitro but vip was not. these data suggest that metabolites of l-arginine mediate neural inhibition of canine pyloric motor activity.
@background progress in cryptology – indocrypt 2013 scan chains are exploited to develop attacks on cryptographic hardware and steal intellectual properties from the chip. this paper proposes a secured strategy to test designs by inserting a certain number of inverters between randomly selected scan cells. the security of the scheme has been analyzed. two detailed case studies of rc4 stream cipher and aes block cipher have been presented to show that the proposed strategy prevents existing scan-based attacks in the literature. the elegance of the scheme lies in its less hardware overhead.
@background endothelin uncouples gap junctions in sustentacular cells and olfactory ensheathing cells of the olfactory mucosa although gap junctions regulate essential processes during development and differentiation, the role of gap junctions in cell death is poorly understood. we demonstrate here that the forced expression of connexin 43 (cx43), the main constituent of astrocytic gap junctions, protected against cell injury with a potency that was comparable with that from the expression of the proto-oncogenebcl2. the expression of two other members of the cx family, cx32 and cx40, also increased the resistance to injury from exposures to calcium overload, oxidative stress, metabolic inhibition, tamoxifen, and uv irradiation, but not against staurosporine- and dexamethasone-mediated death. surprisingly, the anti-death activity of connexin proteins was independent of gap junction channel function, because physical isolation or the pharmacological inhibition of coupling did not significantly increase cell death. moreover, cells expressing nonfunctional mutant connexins also acquired a high resistance to injury. these observations identify cx proteins as active players in cell survival.
@method virulence potential and genomic mapping of the worldwide clone escherichia coli st131 an ongoing outbreak of exceptionally virulent shiga toxin (stx)-producing escherichia coli o104:h4 centered in germany, has caused over 830 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) and 46 deaths since may 2011. serotype o104:h4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with hus in the past. to prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the life technologies ion torrent pgm™ sequencer and optical mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (lb226692) and a historic o104:h4 hus isolate from 2001 (01-09591). reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced pgm™ within 62 hours. the hus-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec) and enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec). phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core e. coli genes indicate that the hus-causing o104:h4 strains and the previously published sequence of the eaec strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common ehec serotypes. though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. we propose a model in which eaec 55989 and ehec o104:h4 strains evolved from a common ehec o104:h4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of eaec and ehec emerged as the current outbreak clone. in conclusion, rapid next-generation technologies facilitated prospective whole genome characterization in the early stages of an outbreak.
@result the saccharomyces cerevisiae histone chaperone rtt106 mediates the cell cycle recruitment of swi/snf and rsc to the hir-dependent histone genes genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved swi/snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates. the mechanism by which this complex is targeted to specific chromosomal loci remains unknown. we show that swi/snf is required for expression of the yeast histone hta1-htb1 locus because of the role of hir1p and hir2p corepressors in negatively regulating transcription. snf5p, snf2p/swi2p, and swi3p, three components of the yeast swi/snf complex, coimmunoprecipitate with each hir protein, and snf5p is maximally associated with the hta1-htb1 promoter when the hir-based repression system is intact and the swi/snf complex is functional. the data support a role for the hir repressors in the gene-specific targeting of swi/snf.
@background proteome-wide identification of lysine propionylation in thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria: geobacillus kaustophilus, thermus thermophilus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and rhodothermus marinus recent studies of protein post-translational modifications revealed that various types of lysine acylation occur in eukaryotic and bacterial proteins. lysine propionylation, a newly discovered type of acylation, occurs in several proteins, including some histones. in this study, we identified 361 propionylation sites in 183 mid-exponential phase and late stationary phase proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8, an extremely thermophilic eubacterium. functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. the propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped. furthermore, amino acid frequencies in the vicinity of propionylation sites differed, not only between the two growth phases but also relative to acetylation sites. in addition, 33.8% of mid-exponential phase–specific and 80.0% of late stationary phase–specific propionylations (n ≥ 2) implied that specific mechanisms regulate propionylation in the cell. moreover, the limited degree of overlap between lysine propionylation (36.8%) and acetylation (49.2%) sites in 67 proteins that were both acetylated and propionylated strongly suggested that the two acylation reactions are regulated separately by specific enzymes and may serve different functions. finally, we also found that eight propionylation sites overlapped with acetylation sites critical for protein functions such as schiff-base formation and ligand binding.
@background the sugarless mutation affects the expression of the white eye color gene in drosophila melanogaster in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
@background activation of risk and safe pathways is not involved in the effects of cx43 deficiency on tolerance to ischemia–reperfusion injury and preconditioning protection activation of several protein kinases occurs during myocardial ischaemia and during subsequent reperfusion. in contrast to the intensive investigation into the significance of kinase activation in cardioprotection, relatively little is known about the role of the phosphatases in this regard. the aim of this study was to re-evaluate the putative roles of pp1 and pp2a in ischaemia/reperfusion and in triggering ischaemic preconditioning. isolated perfused working rat hearts were subjected to sustained global (15 or 20 min) or regional ischaemia (35 min), followed by reperfusion. hearts were preconditioned using global ischaemia (1 × 5 or 3 × 5 min, alternated with 5 min reperfusion). to inhibit both pp1 and pp2a cantharidin (5 μm) was used. to inhibit pp2a only, okadaic acid (7.5 nm) was used. the drugs were administered during the preconditioning protocol, before onset of sustained ischaemia (pretreatment) or during reperfusion. endpoints were mechanical recovery during reperfusion, infarct size and activation of pkb/akt, p38 mapk and erk p42/p44, as determined by western blot. pretreatment of hearts with okadaic acid or cantharidin caused a significant reduction in mechanical recovery after 15 or 20 min global ischaemia. administration of the drugs during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol abolished functional recovery during reperfusion and significantly increased infarct size. administration of the drugs during reperfusion had no deleterious effects and increased functional recovery in 3 × pc hearts. to find an explanation for the differential effects of the inhibitors depending on the time of administration, hearts were freeze-clamped at different time points during the perfusion protocol. administration of cantharidin before 5 min ischaemia activated all kinases. subsequent reperfusion for 5 min without the drug maintained activation of the kinases until the onset of sustained ischaemia. cantharidin given during preconditioning was associated with activation of p38mapk and pkb/akt during reperfusion after sustained ischaemia. however, administration of the drug during reperfusion only after sustained ischaemia caused activation of both pkb/akt and erk p42/p44. phosphatase inhibition immediately prior to the onset of sustained ischaemia or during preconditioning abolishes protection during reperfusion, while inhibition of these enzymes during reperfusion either had no effect or enhanced the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. it is proposed that inhibition of phosphatases during reperfusion may prolong the period of risk activation and hence protect the heart.
@background effect of culturing conditions on the expression of key enzymes in the proteolytic system of lactobacillus bulgaricus abstract lactobacillus helveticus strains possess an efficient proteolytic system that releases peptides which are essential for lactobacillus growth in various fermented dairy products and also affect textural properties or biological activities. cell envelope proteinases (ceps) are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze milk proteins. in the case of l. helveticus, two ceps with low percentages of amino acid identity have been described, i.e., prth and prth2. however, the distribution of the genes that encode ceps still remains unclear, rendering it difficult to further control the formation of particular peptides. this study evaluated the diversity of genes that encode ceps in a collection of strains of l. helveticus isolated from various biotopes, both in terms of the presence or absence of these genes and in terms of nucleotide sequence, and studied their transcription in dairy matrices. after defining three sets of primers for both the prth and prth2 genes, we studied the distribution of the genes by using pcr and southern blotting experiments. the prth2 gene was ubiquitous in the 29 strains of l. helveticus studied, whereas only 18 of them also exhibited the prth gene. sequencing of a 350-bp internal fragment of these genes revealed the existence of intraspecific diversity. finally, expression of these two cep-encoding genes was followed during the growth in dairy matrices of two strains, itg lh77 and cnrz32, which possess one and two cep-encoding genes, respectively. both genes were shown to be expressed by l. helveticus at each stage of growth in milk and at different stages of mini-swiss-type cheese making and ripening.
@method antisense rna polymerase ii divergent transcripts are p-tefb dependent and substrates for the rna exosome transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii (rnapii) is thought to occur unidirectionally from most genes. here, we present evidence of widespread divergent transcription at protein-encoding gene promoters. transcription start site–associated rnas (tssa-rnas) nonrandomly flank active promoters, with peaks of antisense and sense short rnas at 250 nucleotides upstream and 50 nucleotides downstream of tsss, respectively. northern analysis shows that tssa-rnas are subsets of an rna population 20 to 90 nucleotides in length. promoter-associated rnapii and h3k4-trimethylated histones, transcription initiation hallmarks, colocalize at sense and antisense tssa-rna positions; however, h3k79-dimethylated histones, characteristic of elongating rnapii, are only present downstream of tsss. these results suggest that divergent transcription over short distances is common for active promoters and may help promoter regions maintain a state poised for subsequent regulation.
@result developmental regulation of dna replication initiation in drosophila a cluster of drosophila melanogaster chorion genes at locus 66d on the third chromosome amplifies 60-fold in the ovarian follicle cells prior to the onset of gene expression. a 3.8-kilobase (kb) region of the gene cluster can induce tissue-specific amplification in transformants. previous models postulated that amplification is activated in follicle cells by transcription of one of the two chorion genes (s15 and s18) located within the 3.8-kb essential region. in this study, we showed that neither s15 nor s18 chorion gene transcription was required for amplification. however, a 510-bp region upstream from s18 contained sequences essential for both amplification and s18 transcription. no other region within the 3.8-kb fragment was required for amplification. we propose that upstream transcription control elements rather than transcription per se are involved in controlling amplification during development.
@method genome-wide survey of two-component signal transduction systems in the plant growth-promoting bacterium azospirillum magnifying genomes (mage) is a microbial genome annotation system based on a relational database containing information on bacterial genomes, as well as a web interface to achieve genome annotation projects. our system allows one to initiate the annotation of a genome at the early stage of the finishing phase. mage's main features are (i) integration of annotation data from bacterial genomes enhanced by a gene coding re-annotation process using accurate gene models, (ii) integration of results obtained with a wide range of bioinformatics methods, among which exploration of gene context by searching for conserved synteny and reconstruction of metabolic pathways, (iii) an advanced web interface allowing multiple users to refine the automatic assignment of gene product functions. mage is also linked to numerous well-known biological databases and systems. our system has been thoroughly tested during the annotation of complete bacterial genomes (acinetobacter baylyi adp1, pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, frankia alni) and is currently used in the context of several new microbial genome annotation projects. in addition, mage allows for annotation curation and exploration of already published genomes from various genera (e.g. yersinia, bacillus and neisseria). mage can be accessed at .
@background laser-assisted three-dimensional surface modifications of titanium implants: preliminary data purpose titanium endosseous implants are becoming increasingly important in dentistry because of their excellent long-term results. however, it has been reported that these implants may lead to higher concentrations of titanium, especially in the lungs and kidneys. the purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether co2 laser-assisted decontamination of exposed implant surfaces is associated with an increase in titanium release.   materials and methods in 6 beagle dogs, a total of 60 implants were placed. after osseointegration and second-stage surgery, peri-implantitis was induced by cotton floss ligatures for 12 weeks. surgical treatment consisted of granulation tissue removal, including decontamination of the implant surface with 3 different methods. twenty implants were decontaminated conventionally by an air-powder abrasive for 60 seconds. another 20 implants were decontaminated by laser treatment alone. the last 20 implants were treated conventionally by air-powder abrasive and then lased. four months later, fresh tissue samples of various tissues were evaluated by histologic and chemical analysis.   results quantitative analysis indicated that titanium accumulation could be detected, especially in the spleen, liver, oral mucosa, regional lymph nodes, lung, and kidney in the beagle dog model.   discussion the concentrations found did not exceed those previously reported in the literature.   conclusion these results support the hypothesis that co2 laser-assisted therapy of ailing implants will not result in excessive titanium concentrations in tissues. accordingly, co2 lasers appear suitable and safe for peri-implant gingival surgery.
@result class-modeling analysis reveals t-cell homeostasis disturbances involved in loss of immune control in elite controllers background human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) elite controllers are able to control virus replication to levels below the limits of detection by commercial assays, but the actual level of viremia in these individuals is not well defined. here, we quantify plasma hiv-1 rna in elite controllers and correlate this with specific immunologic parameters.   methods plasma hiv-1 rna levels were quantified in 90 elite controllers with use of a real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay with a sensitivity of 0.2 copies/ml. hiv-1-specific immune responses and longitudinal cd4(+) t cell counts were examined.   results the median plasma hiv-1 rna level was 2 copies/ml (interquartile range, 0.2-14 copies/ml). a longitudinal analysis of 31 elite controllers demonstrated 2-5-fold fluctuations in viremia in the majority of individuals; 6 had persistent levels below 1 copy/ml. viremia correlated directly with hiv-1-specific neutralizing antibodies and western blot reactivity but not with cd8(+) t cell responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell decrease was more common among individuals with detectable viremia (p = .04).   conclusions low-level viremia is present in the majority of elite controllers and is associated with higher hiv-1-specific antibody responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell loss is more common among viremic individuals, suggesting that even very low-level viremia has negative consequences over time.
@background a qualitative study of health fairs to increase cancer screening in the u.s. from key informant interviews introduction increasing public awareness and knowledge about the need for colorectal cancer (crc) screening among american indians is key to reducing health disparities. the objective of this study was to assess navajo adults' knowledge of crc risk factors and prevention, crc screening, and self-reported experience with crc screening. methods we collected data generated by a self-administered survey given to navajo adults, most of whom lived on the reservation. data were collected at 2 annual tribal fairs in 2006. fair attendees who visited an exhibit booth completed a crc knowledge survey. the study design was nonrandomized. results of the 285 navajo adults who participated, most were bilingual (74%) and female (80%). of the respondents aged 50 years or older, 77% had heard of crc screening and 28% reported being screened for colon or colorectal cancer. knowledge was high (mean, 5.78 [standard deviation (sd), 1.28]) (8.0 was the highest possible knowledge score). respondents with little or no formal schooling had lower scores (mean, 5.4), indicating less knowledge of crc and associated screening tests than did those with more education (mean, 6.0). conclusion among a sample of navajo adults aged 50 years or older, participants with more education were more likely to be knowledgeable about crc and to have received screening. this survey, led by a navajo investigator with navajo surveyors, revealed a high awareness of crc and screening, but overall crc screening was low. crc education for navajo adults who have little or no formal schooling should be improved.
@background genetic variability of respiratory syncytial virus a in hospitalized children in the last five consecutive winter seasons in central spain human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout life. we investigated the genetic variability of rsv-a circulating in ontario during 2010–2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the g glycoprotein gene. among the 201 consecutive rsv isolates studied, rsv-a (55.7%) was more commonly observed than rsv-b (42.3%). 59.8% and 90.1% of rsv-a infections were among children ≤12 months and ≤5 years old, respectively. on phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 rsv-a strains, 110 (98.2%) clustered within or adjacent to the na1 genotype; two isolates were ga5 genotype. eleven (10%) na1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel rsv-a genotype, named on1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the c-terminal region of the attachment (g) glycoprotein. the predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. using rna secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. the 23 amino acid on1 g gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential o-glycosylation sites including three o-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among ontario na1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype rsv-a2 strain. the tendency of codon regression in the g-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel rsv-a genotype with a72 nucleotide g gene duplication.
@background molecular regulation of alternative polyadenylation (apa) within the drosophila nervous system cleavage factor i(m) (cfi(m)) is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic mrna 3' processing machinery that functions in sequence-specific poly(a) site recognition through the collaboration of a 25 kda subunit containing a nudix domain and a larger subunit of 59, 68, or 72 kda containing an rna recognition motif (rrm). our previous work demonstrated that cfi(m)25 is both necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific binding of the poly(a) site upstream element ugua. here, we report the crystal structure of cfi(m)25 complexed with the rrm domain of cfi(m)68 and rna. the cfi(m)25 dimer is clasped on opposite sides by two cfi(m)68 rrm domains. each cfi(m)25 subunit binds one ugua element specifically. biochemical analysis indicates that the cfi(m)68 rrms serve to enhance rna binding and facilitate rna looping. the intrinsic ability of cfi(m) to direct rna looping may provide a mechanism for its function in the regulation of alternative poly(a) site selection.
@method halide dependence of the halorhodopsin photocycle as measured by time-resolved infrared spectra. abstract— step‐scan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with 50 ns time resolution was applied to the early stages of the photocycle of halorhodopsin (hr) for the temperature range 3‐42° c. kinetic data analysis with global fitting revealed two distinct kinetic processes associated with relaxations of the early red‐shifted photoproduct hk; these processes have time constants t1⋍ 280 ns and t2⋍ 360 μs at 20°c. spectral features demonstrate that the t1 process corresponds to a transition between two distinct bathointermediates, hke and hkl. the vibrational difference bands associated with both t1 and t2 transitions are spread throughout the whole 1800‐900 cm−1 range. however, the largest bands correspond to ethylenic c=c stretches, fingerprint c‐c stretches and hydrogen out‐of‐plane (hoop) wags of the retinal chromophore. the time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the t1 and t2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. the decay of the intense hoop vibrations is nearly equally divided between the t1 and t2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hke) bathointermediate, to a less‐twisted structure in hkl, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hl intermediate. this conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the t1 process. the two relaxations from hke to hl are largely analogous to corresponding relaxations (ke→ kl→ l) in the bacterior‐hodopsin photocycle, except that the second step is slowed down by over 200‐fold in hr.
@result stimulus disparity and punisher control of human signal-detection performance. three experiments using human participants varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers or point-loss punishers in two-alternative signal-detection procedures. experiment 1 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses (group a) and point-loss punishers for errors (group b) across conditions. response bias varied systematically as a function of the relative reinforcer or punisher frequencies. experiment 2 arranged two conditions - one where an unequal ratio of reinforcement (5ratio1 or 1ratio5) was presented without punishment (r-only), and another where the same reinforcer ratio was presented with an equal distribution of point-loss punishers (r+p). response bias was significantly greater in the r-only condition than the r+p condition, supporting a subtractive model of punishment. experiment 3 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses across four unequal reinforcer ratios (5ratio1, 2ratio1, 1ratio2, 1ratio5) both without (r-only) and with (r+p) an equal distribution of point-loss punishers for errors. response bias varied systematically with changes in relative reinforcer frequency for both r-only and r+p conditions, with 5 out of 8 participants showing increases in sensitivity estimates from r-only to r+p conditions. overall, the results indicated that punishers have similar but opposite effects to reinforcers in detection procedures and that combined reinforcer and punisher effects might be better modeled by a subtractive punishment model than an additive punishment model, consistent with research using concurrent-schedule choice procedures.
@background electrostatic mechanisms underlie neomycin block of the cardiac ryanodine receptor channel (ryr2). charybdotoxin (ctx), a small, basic protein from scorpion venom, strongly inhibits the conduction of k ions through high-conductance, ca2+-activated k+ channels. the interaction of ctx with ca2+-activated k+ channels from rat skeletal muscle plasma membranes was studied by inserting single channels into uncharged planar phospholipid bilayers. ctx blocks k+ conduction by binding to the external side of the channel, with an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 10 nm at physiological ionic strength. the dwell-time distributions of both blocked and unblocked states are single-exponential. the toxin association rate varies linearly with the ctx concentration, and the dissociation rate is independent of it. ctx is competent to block both open and closed channels; the association rate is sevenfold faster for the open channel, while the dissociation rate is the same for both channel conformations. membrane depolarization enhances the ctx dissociation rate e-fold/28 mv; if the channel's open probability is maintained constant as voltage varies, then the toxin association rate is voltage independent. increasing the external solution ionic strength from 20 to 300 mm (with k+, na+, or arginine+) reduces the association rate by two orders of magnitude, with little effect on the dissociation rate. we conclude that ctx binding to the ca2+-activated k+ channel is a bimolecular process, and that the ctx interaction senses both voltage and the channel's conformational state. we further propose that a region of fixed negative charge exists near the channel's ctx-binding site.
@method utility of pre-treatment neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and platelet–lymphocyte ratio as prognostic factors in breast cancer background: inflammation influences cancer development and progression. an elevated platelet to lymphocyte ratio (plr), a marker of inflammation, has been linked to poor prognosis in several malignancies. here, we quantify the prognostic impact of this biomarker. methods: a systematic review of databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association of blood plr and overall survival (os) in solid tumors. data were pooled in a meta-analysis. pooled hrs for os by disease group and by plr cutoff groups were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling. results: twenty studies comprising 12,754 patients were assessed. cutoffs for plr defining risk groups ranged from 150 to 300 and were dichotomous (12 studies; group 1) or split into three groups (<150/150–300/>300, 8 studies; group 2). higher plr was associated with significantly worse os in group 1 [hr = 1.87; 95% confidence interval (ci, 1.49–2.34); p < 0.001] and with a nonsignificant association in group 2 (hr per higher category = 1.21; 95%ci, 0.97–1.50; p = 0.10). the size of effect of plr on os was greater for metastatic disease (hr[group 1] = 2.0; 95% ci, 1.6–2.7; hr[group 2] = 1.6; 95% ci, 1.1–2.4) than for early-stage disease (hr[group 1] = 1.5; 95% ci, 1.0–2.2; hr[group 2] = 1.0; 95% ci, 0.8–1.3). a significant association was observed for colorectal, hepatocellular, gastroesophageal, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinoma in group 1 and for colorectal cancers in group 2. conclusion: a high plr is associated with worse os in various solid tumors. further research of its regulation and relevance in daily practice is warranted. impact: plr is a readily available and inexpensive biomarker with independent prognostic value in solid tumors. cancer epidemiol biomarkers prev; 23(7); 1204–12. ©2014 aacr.
@background development of bovine embryos reconstructed by nuclear transfer of transfected and non-transfected adult fibroblast cells. the objective of this study was to determine if the transfection of human prourokinase (prou) gene and passage number of transfected ear fibroblasts affected in vitro development of bovine transgenic nuclear transfer (nt) embryos. an expression plasmid for human prou was constructed by inserting a bovine beta-casein promoter, a green fluorescent protein (gfp) marker and human prou gene into a pcdna3 plasmid and transfected into bovine ear fibroblasts using a lipid mediated method. abattoir derived oocytes were enucleated at 18-20 hr post maturation and a single donor cell was transferred into the perivitelline space of a recipient oocyte. after fusion and activation, the couplets were cultured in modified synthetic oviductal fluid (msof) medium for 168 hr. in experiment 1, significantly lower rate in blastocysts formation (10.3%) was observed in transfected donor cells at early passage than that in nontransfected counterparts (22.1%, p<0.05). in experiment 2, development to blastocysts and gfp expression in blastocysts were not significantly different between early (3-7) and late (8-12) passage donor cells (10.3 vs. 11.3% and 54.5 vs. 41.7%, respectively). this study indicates that in vitro development of bovine transgenic nt embryos is negatively influenced by transfection of human prou gene into donor fibroblasts. however, passage number of transfected ear fibroblasts does not affect in vitro development of bovine transgenic nt embryos.
@method the effect of anethum graveolens l. (dill) on corticosteroid induced diabetes mellitus: involvement of thyroid hormones scopoletin (7‐hydroxy‐6‐methoxy coumarin) was isolated from the leaves of aegle marmelos and evaluated for its potential to regulate hyperthyroidism, lipid peroxidation and hyperglycemia in levo‐thyroxine‐induced hyperthyroid rats. scopoletin (1.00 mg/kg, p.o.) administered daily for 7 days to levo‐thyroxine‐treated animals decreased the levels of serum thyroid hormones and glucose as well as hepatic glucose‐6‐phosphatase activity, demonstrating its potential to regulate hyperthyroidism and hyperglycemia. scopoletin also inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation and increased the activity of antioxidants, superoxide dismutase and catalase. compared with the standard antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil, scopoletin exhibited a superior therapeutic activity, since unlike propylthiouracil, it also inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation. these findings indicate that scopoletin has the potential to inhibit thyroid function and hyperglycemia without hepatotoxicity. copyright © 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.
@background preventive effect of aminoguanidine compared to vitamin e and c on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
@background mating type influences chromosome loss and replicative senescence in telomerase‐deficient budding yeast by dnl4‐dependent telomere fusion using a model system, we have shown that replicative senescence is accompanied by a 16-fold increase in base substitution and frameshift mutations near a chromosome end. the increase was dependent on error-prone polymerases required for the mutagenic response to dna lesions that block the replication fork.
@method breath-by-breath fluctuations of pulmonary gas exchange and ventilation in copd patients excess co2 is generated when lactate is increased during exercise because its [h+] is buffered primarily by hco-3 (22 ml for each meq of lactic acid). we developed a method to detect the anaerobic threshold (at), using computerized regression analysis of the slopes of the co2 uptake (vco2) vs. o2 uptake (vo2) plot, which detects the beginning of the excess co2 output generated from the buffering of [h+], termed the v-slope method. from incremental exercise tests on 10 subjects, the point of excess co2 output (at) predicted closely the lactate and hco-3 thresholds. the mean gas exchange at was found to correspond to a small increment of lactate above the mathematically defined lactate threshold [0.50 +/- 0.34 (sd) meq/l] and not to differ significantly from the estimated hco-3 threshold. the mean vo2 at at computed by the v-slope analysis did not differ significantly from the mean value determined by a panel of six experienced reviewers using traditional visual methods, but the at could be more reliably determined by the v-slope method. the respiratory compensation point, detected separately by examining the minute ventilation vs. vco2 plot, was consistently higher than the at (2.51 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.30 l/min of vo2). this method for determining the at has significant advantages over others that depend on regular breathing pattern and respiratory chemosensitivity.
@background cadmium induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin and increases expression of c-myc and abcb1a in kidney proximal tubule cells cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
@method a novel atac-seq approach reveals lineage-specific reinforcement of the open chromatin landscape via cooperation between baf and p63 chromatin structure can affect the transcriptional activity of eukaryotic structural genes by blocking access of sequence-specific activator proteins (activators) to their promoter-binding sites1. for example, the dna-binding domain of the yeast gal4 protein interacts very poorly with nucleosome cores compared with naked dna2 (and see below), and binding of other activators is even more strongly inhibited2,3. the way in which activators bind to nucleosomal dna is therefore a critical aspect of transcriptional activation. genetic studies have suggested that the multi-component swi/snf complex of saccharomyces cerevisiae facilitates transcription by altering the structure of the chromatin4,5. here we identify and partially purify a human homologue of the yeast swi/snf complex (hswi/snf complex). we show that a partially purified hswi/snf complex mediates the atp-dependent disruption of a nucleosome, thereby enabling the activators, gal4–vp16 and gal4–ah, to bind within a nucleosome core. we conclude that the hswi/snf complex acts directly to reorganize chromatin structure so as to facilitate binding of transcription factors.
@method the neonatal sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase gives a clue to development and pathology in human muscles the relative mrna levels corresponding to the different sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum ca(2+)-atpase isoforms (serca1a, serca1b, serca2a, serca2b and serca3) were measured by reverse transcriptase-pcr in rat soleus muscles regenerating after notexin-induced necrosis. the succession of appearance of the different types of serca mrna species in regenerating muscle largely recapitulates those observed during normal ontogenesis. the mrna levels of the muscle-specific isoforms serca1a and serca2a became very low on the first and third days after injection of the snake venom. it was only on the fifth day of regeneration that the mrna of the neonatal variant of the fast-twitch skeletal serca1b isoform began to rise, well before the other serca transcripts. at 7 and 10 days, i.e. at a time when the new myofibres normally become reinnervated, the mrna level of serca1a and serca2a increased markedly, but the fast-twitch skeletal serca1a isoform was still the most prominent. on day 21, in the advanced stage of regeneration, a switch in the relative expression levels of serca1a and serca2a mrna was observed and the ratio of both isoforms became similar to that found in the normal soleus muscles. this was followed by a decline in the level of all serca mrna species, so that on day 28 the levels of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmatic-reticulum ca(2+)-pump rnas was again lower but their ratio remained similar to that of the untreated control soleus.
@background incidence of cronobacter sakazakii in powdered infant formula milk available in malaysia enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen associated with life-threatening neonatal infections resulting from the consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula milk (ifm). recent taxonomic analyses have determined that e. sakazakii comprises a number of genomospecies, and it has been proposed that e. sakazakii be reclassified as a novel genus, "cronobacter". accurate methods are required for the rapid detection and identification of this group of micro-organisms, since even low cell numbers have been reported to cause disease. the aim of this study was to evaluate various e. sakazakii detection methods in order to ascertain the most suitable method for detection and identification of these pathogenic agents. samples from ifm and the environment were evaluated for the presence of e. sakazakii using the isolation steps (pre-enrichment, enrichment and selection) described in the food and drug administration (fda) method for e. sakazakii detection. sixty-four isolates (50 from ifm and 14 from the environment) were selected from tryptone soy agar (tsa), regardless of colony appearance, and these isolates were identified by 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequencing. thereafter, different culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were evaluated to accurately detect and identify the e. sakazakii isolates. these methods included the assessment of yellow pigment production on tsa, typical colonies on chromogenic druggan-forsythe-iversen (dfi) and chromocult enterobacter sakazakii (ces) media and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using six different species-specific primer pairs described in the literature. identification of e. sakazakii using yellow pigment production was demonstrated to have a low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (87%, 71% and 74%, respectively), which lowers the suitability of the fda method. chromogenic dfi and ces media were sensitive, specific and accurate (100%, 98% and 98%, respectively) for the detection of e. sakazakii. the specificity of the pcr amplifications ranged from 8% to 92%, emphasising the need for rigorous primer testing against closely related species. of the primer pairs evaluated, esakf/esakr were the most suitable for e. sakazakii detection and identification. the detection limit of esakf/esakr was found to be 10(4) cfu/ml. this study demonstrated that no single method was capable of unambiguously confirming the presence and identity of e. sakazakii isolates, that each method had inherent advantages and disadvantages, and that in most cases several methods were required for accurate detection and identification. further, it was demonstrated that the current fda method for e. sakazakii detection should be revised in the light of the availability of more sensitive, specific and accurate detection methods.
@background effect of selenium supplementation on blood status and milk, urine, and fecal excretion in pregnant and lactating camel selenium (se) is an essential micronutrient for the prevention of a number of deficiency syndromes in a variety of species (underwood, 1981). the occurrence of se deficiency in the dromedary camel was reported by zhang et al. (1986). in morocco, se deficiency is a widespread problem in the major grazing areas (hamliri, 1989) and one of the authors (a.h.) has diagnosed cases of se deficiency in a group of young dromedary camels consuming a diet containing 0.02 p.p.m. se on a dry matter basis. the seleno-enzyme glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) is widely used as an indicator of se status because it is regularly correlated with blood se concentration (ganther et az., 1976). however, to the authors’ knowledge this correlation has not been previously studied in the dromedary camel.
@background extending the supply chain visibility boundary: utilizing stakeholders for identifying supply chain sustainability risks despite ambitious efforts in various fields of research over multiple decades, the goal of making academic research relevant to the practitioner remains elusive: theoretical and academic research interests do not seem to coincide with the interests of managerial practice. this challenge is more fundamental than knowledge transfer, it is one of diverging knowledge interests and means of knowledge production. in this paper, we look at this fundamental challenge through the lens of design science, which is an approach aimed primarily at discovery and problem-solving as opposed to accumulation of theoretical knowledge. we explore in particular the ways in which problem-solving research and theory-oriented academic research can complement one another. in operations management (om) research, recognizing and building on this complementarity is especially crucial, because problem-solving-oriented research produces the very artifacts (e.g., technologies) that empirical om research subsequently evaluates in an attempt to build explanatory theory. it is indeed the practitioner - not the academic scientist - who engages in basic research in om. this idiosyncrasy prompts the question: how can we enhance the cross-fertilization between academic research and research practice to make novel theoretical insights and practical relevance complementary? this article proposes a design science approach to bridge practice to theory, not vice versa, theory to practice.
@background liquid- and gas-phase diffusion of ferrocene in thin films of metal-organic frameworks metal-organic frameworks (mofs) are highly porous materials generally consisting of two building elements: inorganic coupling units and organic linkers. these frameworks offer an enormous porosity, which can be used to store large amounts of gases and, as demonstrated in more recent applications, makes these compounds suitable for drug release. the huge sizes of the pores inside mofs, however, also give rise to a fundamental complication, namely the formation of sublattices occupying the same space. this interpenetration greatly reduces the pore size and thus the available space within the mof structure. we demonstrate here that the formation of the second, interpenetrated framework can be suppressed by using liquid-phase epitaxy on an organic template. this success demonstrates the potential of the step-by-step method to synthesize new classes of mofs not accessible by conventional solvothermal methods.
@method breast motion asymmetry during running abstract although breast pain has been related to vertical breast displacement and velocity, the influence of breast support on multi-planar breast kinematics and breast comfort has yet to be ascertained. the aims of this study were to investigate multi-planar breast displacement, velocity, and acceleration with and without breast support during running and to establish the correlation with breast comfort. fifteen females ran at 2.8 m · s−1 in no bra, an everyday bra, and a sports bra. three-dimensional coordinates of breast and body markers were tracked during ten gait cycles and following each trial the participants rated their breast comfort. relative breast displacement was calculated and derived for velocity and acceleration. vertical breast displacement, velocity, and acceleration peaked at, before, and after mid-stance, respectively. the patterns of displacement and velocity trajectories were unaffected by increasing breast support, though the magnitudes were significantly reduced. the magnitude and trajectory of breast acceleration was unaffected by increasing breast support and showed no correlation with comfort. breast velocity displayed the strongest relationship to comfort (r = 0.61). considerable mediolateral and anteroposterior breast kinematics were identified, suggesting that future studies and bra design may benefit from three-dimensional analysis. in conclusion, improvements in breast support may be defined by reductions in breast velocity and displacement.
@background ultrahigh-pressure acoustic wave velocities of sio2-al2o3 glasses up to 200 gpa acoustic wave velocities of sio2 glass were measured up to pressures of 207 gpa using newly developed brillouin scattering spectroscopic techniques to address the nature of pressure-induced structural changes. the acoustic wave velocity data suggests three distinct pressure regimes, two of which correspond to changes in the si-o coordination number with pressure, and one of which indicates the stability of sixfold-coordinated si over a broad pressure interval from approximately 40-140 gpa. an anomalous increase in the effect of pressure on velocity at 140 gpa most likely corresponds to the onset of structural densification associated with an increase in coordination number from sixfold to a higher coordination state.
@background do we follow evidence-based medicine recommendations during inguinal hernia surgery? results of a survey covering 2441 hernia repairs in 2007 introductionchronic pain after hernia repair is common, and it is unclear to what extent the different operation techniques influence its incidence. the aim of the present study was to compare the three major standardized techniques of hernia repair with regard to postoperative pain.patients and methodstwo hundred and eighty male patients with primary hernias were prospectively, randomly selected to undergo shouldice, tension-free lichtenstein or laparoscopic transabdominal pre-peritoneal (tapp) hernioplasty repairs. patients were examined after 52 months with emphasis on chronic pain and its limitations to their quality of life.resultschronic pain was present in 36% of patients after shouldice repair, in 31% after lichtenstein repair and in 15% after tapp repair. pain correlated with physical strain in 25% of patients after shouldice, in 20% after lichtenstein and in 11% after tapp repair. limitations to daily life, leisure activities and sports occurred in 14% of patients after shouldice, 13% after lichtenstein and 2.4% after tapp repair.conclusionchronic pain after hernia surgery is significantly more common with the open approach to the groin by shouldice and lichtenstein methods. the presence of the prosthetic mesh was not associated with significant postoperative complaints. the tapp repair represents the most effective approach of the three techniques in the hands of an experienced surgeon.
@background learning secure programming in open source software communities: a socio-technical view ethnography is a qualitative research method used to study people and cultures. it is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice, i.e., it can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. despite its potential, ethnography has not been widely adopted by empirical software engineering researchers, and receives little attention in the related literature. the main goal of this paper is to explain how empirical software engineering researchers would benefit from adopting ethnography. this is achieved by explicating four roles that ethnography can play in furthering the goals of empirical software engineering: to strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineering; to inform the design of software engineering tools; to improve method and process development; and to inform research programmes. this article introduces ethnography, explains its origin, context, strengths and weaknesses, and presents a set of dimensions that position ethnography as a useful and usable approach to empirical software engineering research. throughout the paper, relevant examples of ethnographic studies of software practice are used to illustrate the points being made.
@background physiological and molecular mechanisms of plant salt tolerance transgenic plants overexpressing the vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase are much more resistant to high concentrations of nacl and to water deprivation than the isogenic wild-type strains. these transgenic plants accumulate more na+ and k+ in their leaf tissue than the wild type. moreover, direct measurements on isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles derived from the avp1 transgenic plants and from wild type demonstrate that the vesicles from the transgenic plants have enhanced cation uptake. the phenotypes of the avp1 transgenic plants suggest that increasing the vacuolar proton gradient results in increased solute accumulation and water retention. presumably, sequestration of cations in the vacuole reduces their toxic effects. genetically engineered drought- and salt-tolerant plants could provide an avenue to the reclamation of farmlands lost to agriculture because of salinity and a lack of rainfall.

@method habitat at the mountain tops: how long can rock ptarmigan (lagopus muta helvetica) survive rapid climate change in the swiss alps? a multi-scale approach with the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and gis tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. a wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. in this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. the variety of statistical techniques used is growing. ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (glm) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. gam), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. the selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche). conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. in the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. new methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (roc)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. the choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. this may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. in turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. © 2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.
@background maternal separation and handling affects cocaine self-administration in both the treated pups as adults and the dams the effect of corticosterone on the acquisition of cocaine-seeking behavior was investigated in rats using ascending dose-response curves for intravenous cocaine self-administration. rats pretreated daily with corticosterone (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) acquired cocaine self-administration at a lower dose compared with vehicle-treated controls. in contrast, daily corticosterone pretreatment did not alter food-maintained responding. cocaine self-administration was not affected by the type i (mineralocorticoid) receptor agonist, aldosterone (100 microgram/kg). however, rats treated with the type ii (glucocorticoid) receptor agonist, dexamethasone (10 or 100 microgram/kg) did not acquire self-administration at any dose tested. the 100 microgram/kg dose of dexamethasone attenuated food-reinforced behavior and decreased body weight, but these effects were not observed with the 10 microgram/kg dose. dexamethasone dose-dependently attenuated the plasma corticosterone response to self-administered infusions or intraperitoneal injections of cocaine, indicating that the ability of dexamethasone to block cocaine-induced corticosterone secretion may have contributed to its effects on self-administration. administration of aldosterone (100 microgram/kg) together with 10 microgram/kg dexamethasone restored self-administration to the level of vehicle-treated rats, suggesting that type i receptor occupation by corticosterone may be required for the acquisition of this behavior. these results indicate that stress-induced corticosterone secretion may provide a substrate through which stressors interact with cocaine reinforcement. additionally, the finding that dexamethasone blocks the acquisition of cocaine self-administration may be relevant to the development of novel approaches to the treatment of cocaine addiction.
@background organic acid profile of isovaleric acidemia: a comprehensive metabolomics approach isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
@result bacterial n2-fixation in mangrove ecosystems: insights from a diazotroph–mangrove interaction trichodesmium spp. have proved to be enigmatic organisms, and their ecology and physiology are unusual among diazotrophs. recent research shows that they can simultaneously fix n2 and take up combined nitrogen. the co-occurrence of these two processes is thought to be incompatible, but they could be obligatory in trichodesmium spp. if only a small fraction of cells within a colony or along a filament are capable of n2 fixation. combined nitrogen is released from cells during periods of active growth and n2 fixation, and concomitantly taken up by trichodesmium spp. or cells living in association with colonies. although the nitrogenase of trichodesmium spp. is affected by high concentrations of combined nitrogen, it might be relatively less sensitive to low concentrations of combined nitrogen typical of the oligotrophic ocean and culture conditions. nitrogenase activity and synthesis exhibits an endogenous rhythm in trichodesmium spp. cultures, which is affected by the addition of nitrogen.
@background partial characterization of venom from the colombian spider phoneutria boliviensis (aranae:ctenidae) several pools of neurotoxic peptides obtained from fractionated phoneutria nigriventer venom induce different toxicological effects. one of them, phtx4, is highly toxic towards insects and displays only a slight toxicity when injected in mice. also, this fraction contains a class of peptides that are able to inhibit glutamate uptake in preparations of mammalian central nervous systems (cns). in this work a new toxin called pntx4-3 was isolated from the phtx4 fraction by reverse phase and anion exchange steps using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). edman sequencing of pntx4-3 revealed that it was a polypeptide of 48 amino acid residues, containing 10 cysteines cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. the molecular mass measured by es-q-tof mass spectrometry was 5199.49+/-0.64 da, which is very close to the calculated mass from amino acid sequence (5199.99 da). this toxin induces immediate excitatory effects when injected intrathoracically in house flies and cockroaches. intracerebroventricular injections of 30 microg of pntx4-3 in mice resulted in no apparent signs of intoxication. in order to make an orthologous comparison, pharmacological characterisation were carried out in rat brain synaptosomes by using [3h]-l-glutamate, showed that the whole phtx4 fraction as well as the pure toxins pntx4-3, tx4(6-1) and tx4(5-5) obtained of this fraction, were able to inhibit the glutamate uptake in the micromolar concentration range. pntx4-3 inhibits the glutamate uptake in a dose dependent manner, with an ic50 of approximately 1 microm. pntx4-3 is highly homologous to the tx4(6-1) and tx4(5-5) toxins previously described from the same fraction.
@background bleeding patterns with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system when used for heavy menstrual bleeding in women without structural pelvic pathology: a pooled analysis of randomized controlled studies. a 20 micrograms/24 hours levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device (lng-iud) has, in an open randomized multicenter study, been compared to the copper-releasing device nova t during 5 years of use; 1821 women had the lng-iud and 937 women had the nova t inserted. the 5-year cumulative gross pregnancy rate was 5.9% for nova t and 0.5% for the lng-iud. the local effect of levonorgestrel in the uterine cavity causes reduction of menstrual blood loss and development of oligo-amenorrhea, and the termination rates because of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual flow were significantly (p < 0.001) lower among lng-iud users. however, the gross termination rate because of amenorrhea was 6.0 in this group. hb increased during use of the lng-iud and decreased during nova t use, and the difference between the devices was statistically significant. the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) was low in lng-iud users regardless of age, whereas in the nova t group, the pid rate was increased among the youngest women, which makes the difference between the devices significant (p < 0.01). the gross termination rate for reasons considered to be hormonal was 12.1 in the lng-iud group compared to 2.0 in the nova t group (p < 0.001). the lng-iud is a long-acting reversible contraceptive method for 5 years with a pregnancy rate comparable to female sterilization. the incidence of pid is low even in young women. in addition, the positive health effects such as decreased menstrual blood loss and increased blood haemoglobin concentration make the lng-iud a favorable combination of hormonal and intrauterine contraception.
